#### Objective:

The objective of this project is to demonstrate your ability to ethically scrape and analyze web data, utilize sentiment analysis, and leverage AI to personalize communication. You will focus on identifying potential participants for a clinical trial by analyzing sentiments expressed on Reddit.


#### Assignment Details:


**1. Setup and Requirements**

- Set up your development environment for scraping Reddit. Consider using Python with libraries like PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper).

- Ensure compliance with Redditâ€™s API terms of use and respect user privacy and data use policies.


**2. Project Overview**

- Develop a script to scrape Reddit posts and comments from specific subreddits related to health conditions relevant to the clinical trial.

- Perform sentiment analysis on the scraped data to determine the general attitude and interest levels regarding clinical trials.

- Use the OpenAI API to generate personalized messages aimed at users who express interest in or could potentially benefit from participating in a clinical trial.


**3. Specific Tasks:**

- **Data Collection**: Scrape relevant subreddits for posts and comments about clinical trials.

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of the posts to gauge user opinions and receptiveness towards clinical trials.

- **Message Generation**: Use the sentiment analysis results to segment users by interest level, and generate personalized messages using the OpenAI API to engage these users about participating in a clinical trial.


**4. Documentation:**

- Provide a README file with:

  - Setup instructions for running your code.

  - A brief discussion of your methodology and any challenges you faced.

  - Examples of data collected, analysis performed, and messages generated.

  - Ethical considerations you took into account when designing and implementing your solution.


**5. Evaluation Criteria:**

- **Functionality**: How well does your script perform the tasks of scraping, analyzing, and generating messages?

- **Code Quality**: Is your code efficient, organized, and well-documented?

- **Innovation**: How creatively did you solve the problem and handle challenges?

- **Ethical Considerations**: How well did you address ethical concerns related to data privacy and user engagement?
