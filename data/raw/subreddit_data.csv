My Boss Questioned my Scars,"So, it finally happened yesterday...I caved and wore a t-shirt to work. My boss saw my arms and my side when I was getting something off the shelf. He saw that I was covered in scars and started asking questions. He knows I have PTSD, and I don't think he meant to be pushy and make me uncomfortable, but it was just rapid fire questions about them for about 5 minutes.

And then he showed me his scars. He told me how he got each one, and how he got over the trauma from them. He showed me his bullet wounds, his burns, and his knife wounds. And he told me not to get heatstroke by wearing sweaters all summer just for a few scars. We talked about his tattoos and what I would want to cover mine with.

A cow down the road from me is helping me work through my depression and PTSD.,"I recently experienced a violent trauma that left me feeling hopeless. I had to move.

Can We all Agree That Our Mental Illness Is Not An Excuse For Abuse?,"I'm seeing a lot of posts on here with members of this community excusing other members for their blatant abuse of their partners. It is unacceptable.

It is not our fault that we have PTSD but it is out responsibility to keep it in check and not harm others. The amount of blame I'm seeing being put on the partners of members of this community after a person with PTSD has an outburst and abuses them is unsettling at best and triggering at worst.

Imagine if someone was excusing your abuser in this way.

I'm embarrassed to use the word 'triggered',"I assume most of us here have things that either set off a state of panic, or immediately put us in an anxious mindset, where a flashback is more likely to take ahold.

The best word to use for that is a 'trigger', but it's been so co-opted by people being dramatic in political discourse that it just sounds silly to me. The moment I even begin a sentence with 'I got triggered by...' it just makes me cringe.

fuck forgiveness,"What is with this unhealthy obsession people have with forgiveness? Why do I have to forgive every wrong done to me? Why is it that if I can't forgive I can't move past it (to them)? Why do they think that because I 'can't forgive' that I'm always thinking about it, brooding resentment?

Why can't they just accept that I've been hurt? I will never forget what happened, and it doesn't mean I am dwelling on it and creating resentment in my heart. My intrusive thoughts are not proof that it is constantly on my mind and that it's a sign that I need to just forgive and forget and move on to heal.

This weird obsession with healing in not healthy! Sometimes there is no healing, there is only managing whats left. Sometimes there is never resolution. Sometimes, the person whose been hurt decides the pain is not worth it. Why is that not acceptable? Why is it being a coward?

And fuck you for telling me I need more patience. I've been TOO patient my entire life. I dont have the capacity for patience anymore. I am in constant pain, physical and mental. Why can't I be allowed to say ENOUGH!? Why am I not allowed to have a break? I need a vacation from this pain but there is no leaving it behind.

Extreme Independence is a Trauma Response,"
The inability to receive support from others is a trauma response.

Your “I don’t need anyone, I’ll just do it all myself” conditioning is a survival tactic. And you needed it to shield your heart from abuse, neglect, betrayal, and disappointment from those who could not or would not be there for you.

From the parent who was absent and abandoned you by choice or the parent who was never home from working three jobs to feed and house you.

From the lovers who offered sexual intimacy but never offered a safe haven that honored your heart.

From the friendships and family who ALWAYS took more than they ever gave.

From all the situations when someone told you “we’re in this together” or “I got you” then abandoned you, leaving you to pick up the pieces when shit got real, leaving you to handle your part and their part, too.

From all the lies and all the betrayals.

You learned along the way that you just couldn’t really trust people. Or that you could trust people, but only up to a certain point.

Extreme-independence IS. A. TRUST. ISSUE.

You learnt: if I don’t put myself in a situation where I rely on someone, I won’t have to be disappointed when they don’t show up for me, or when they drop the ball... because they will ALWAYS drop the ball EVENTUALLY right?

You may even have been intentionally taught this protection strategy by generations of hurt ancestors who came before you. 

Extreme-independence is a preemptive strike against heartbreak.

So, you don’t trust anyone.

And you don’t trust yourself, either, to choose people.

To trust is to hope, to trust is to be vulnerable.

“Never again,” you vow.

But no matter how you dress it up and display it proudly to make it seem like this level of independence is what you always wanted to be, in truth it’s your wounded, scarred, broken heart behind a protective brick wall.

Impenetrable. Nothing gets in. No hurt gets in. But no love gets in either.

Fortresses and armor are for those in battle, or who believe the battle is coming.

It’s a trauma response.

The good news is trauma that is acknowledged is trauma that can be healed.

You are worthy of having support.
You are worthy of having true partnership.
You are worthy of love.
You are worthy of having your heart held.
You are worthy to be adored.
You are worthy to be cherished.
You are worthy to have someone say, “You rest. I got this.” And actually deliver on that promise.
You are worthy to receive.
You are worthy to receive.
You are worthy.

You don’t have to earn it.
You don’t have to prove it.
You don’t have to bargain for it.
You don’t have to beg for it.

You are worthy.
Worthy.
Simply because you exist.

"I am a victim of child sexual abuse. Last night, I finally took control back over my life.

I confronted him about him coercing me and forcing me to perform sexual acts with him when I was a child. 

Next week I have an appointment to meet with the detective in charge of the case. The video of him confessing and repeatedly apologizing is over 20mins long. It's damning and will just be icing on the cake of a VERY big case against my abuser. 

As of now, only 2 weeks into this investigation with no publicity, there are 4 young boys including myself that we know of that were raped and molested by this man. 

I have on tape his confession to 3 of them. 

The weeks leading up to this moment were rough. The decision to take this step was entirely mine. I'm finally taking back control over the situation. I can't take away the fact that I was abused for many years by him, or take it away for the others. But today... Today I can say I have taken more steps to prevent it from happening to any others. I can take control over my future somewhat.

I hate it when people use the word “triggered” to mean “upset”.,"It’s been common for a few years now for people to use the word “triggered” online when someone gets upset at something that was posted/said.

It bothers me because I feel it minimizes actual “triggers”.  When I’m triggered, my body almost goes into shock. I can’t breathe, my chest hurts, I get dizzy, etc.  

Someone getting angry at someone with a MAGA hat isn’t triggered. They are angry. 

I wouldn’t wish PTSD on anyone, but I wish more people understood the gravity of an actual trigger for those of us with PTSD.

EDITED FOR CLARITY : I am referencing when someone says that another person is “triggered” because they got upset or angry. (I’m my experience only online).

Rape jokes really aren’t funny,I was repeatedly raped and physically abused by a romantic partner of mine.

Update: I told my Dad,"14F here. So this morning I posted here about whether I should tell my dad about my mom’s abuse. He didn’t know because she would only do it when he was at work or deployed. After reading all of the supportive comments and advice, I decided to tell him. Some of you advised that I showed him the post or write a letter, and I decided to do the latter. 

Basically I explained in the letter that she would explode in anger when I did something wrong and briefly described the incidents I talked about in my previous post. I also admitted that the abuse was causing me to be suicidal. I then said I had been scared of telling him because I didn’t want to cause the end of their marriage and his job, but I needed to tell him because it had been getting worse and worse and I needed help. 

I had the letter written and when my Dad got home from work I asked to talk to him. We went up to my room, he sat on my bed, and I gave him the letter. It’s hard to describe what I was feeling in that moment. Knowing that our whole lives could change when he read it, for better or worse. I watched his face as he read it and had my hands clasped so tightly together to stop them from shaking that it hurt. His face said a lot. His eyes widened really big, and then he looked really sad. 

When he finally finished the letter, he got up and hugged me. He then started crying. My dad doesn’t cry often, and I’ve never seen him cry this much. He kept saying how sorry he was. I just stood there let him hug me. The relief I felt that he believed me was immeasurable. When he let go, he held onto my hands and asked if I would be okay up here while he went to talk to my mom. He looked worried, and I was confused at first until I realized he probably asked because I said I was suicidal. I told him I would, and that I wasn’t actively suicidal. There were just times, usually right after she’d hurt me, that I felt that way. He looked pretty broken up by that but he nodded and told me to pack some clothes and things because we would likely leave for the night and go to a hotel. 

While I was packing I could hear them. My Mom was denying it at first, but I guess my dad shut that down because then she started crying and screaming about how I was literally useless around the house and would never make it in the world if I didn’t mature. I should mention that in my 14 years, my dad never once raised his voice at my mom. She was always the yeller of the family, even to him sometimes. But he yelled at her that I was a child not her servant, and that abusing me would not prepare me for adulthood, it would prevent me from getting to adulthood. I got chills when he said that. 

A couple minutes later, he came back up, gave me another hug, and told me we were going to stay at a hotel for the night. I asked if they were getting a divorce, and he said yes, but it wasn’t because of me. He said he couldn’t be married to an abuser, and thanked me for telling him. He said he was so sorry that he didn’t know sooner, and that as soon as things got settled, he would get me therapy because knowing I had ever felt like I wanted to die had scared him a lot, and he wanted to everything he could to help me never feel like that again. 

Aaaand that’s when I started crying. It was a good few minutes before we actually left. He just held me while I cried out all that stress that had been building. I couldn’t believe it was really over. I’m in the car now with him on the way to the hotel. I tried asking about his job and custody but he said that he would worry about all that, but that he would tell me once he got everything sorted out. He also said public school could be scary but nothing like my mom made it out to be (I was homeschooled and she was using the threat of public school as one of the things to keep me from telling him) but that was another thing that would come in time, he said.

Thank you to everyone here who gave me the courage to tell him the truth. Uncertain times are far from over, but I can finally feel safe and protected, and that I’m not alone.

This sub saved my life. I thought my husband had mental illness and you guys told me he was abusing me and warned me of the red flags. I'm getting a divorce. Thank you guys so much.,I didn't understand what was happening and he kept telling me not to go to therapy and not to go to the doctor when I was injured. I was confused and trapped in the house with him for a year. He was really dangerous and I didn't understand and I was isolated from my family. This group told me that it was starting to sound really fishy and warned me of red flags. You guys were right and I'm getting a divorce.

does anybody else feel like they “lost themselves” for a few years?,"all of this ptsd stuff started in fall 2020 for me- i feel like i lost myself when it started. i turned into a different person until july 2022, when i started to feel normal again. now, looking back, i have a hard time remembering anything between fall 2020 and july 2022. does anybody relate? 

the reason why i know i turned to to a different person is because i pushed away everybody that i loved- when i “woke up” in july, they were all gone. 

lmk if any of u guys relate

Let’s talk about the elephant in the room,"Every time you see PTSD symptoms online or elsewhere, they include the classic symptoms such as flashbacks, hyper vigilance, etc. However, nobody talks about another common symptom, minimizing your trauma. Saying things like, “What happened to me wasn’t that bad. Others have been through worse.” The reason why we do this is because it’s our brain trying to protect itself from potentially more emotional damage but in reality, that’s exactly what it’s doing, causing more damage. Think of it like a fever. A fever can help you recover. When the fever gets dangerously hot, your body is still using this as a way to protect itself but in reality, it’s just making the illness worse. 

I also use apps to help with my trauma but none of them have anything to help out with this symptom when they really should as it is a very common and miserable symptom. That’s all I have to say.

I was raped by a woman - I’m a man. I feel invisible and invalid.,"I don’t want to go in too in-depth, but I was raped via envelopment in 2022 by a woman. 

I said stop multiple times, she got aggressive and essentially pinned me down and continued when I tried to stop her. I didn’t want to wake her roommate up or make her more mad than she already was. I kinda just gave up and embraced the nauseating pain.

The rape only lasted around 15-30 seconds to maybe a minute, but it felt like an eternity.

I’ve had a very hard time confronting what happened that night. It goes against society’s view of rape and it took me a long time to even admit that I was raped. I got diagnosed with PTSD, spoke with RAINN’s chatline and have been in EMDR therapy. I self harmed for the first time in 2023 to cope with the terrible memories. I considered suicide on multiple occasions.

I’m doing better now, but I can’t help but feel isolated because my case is considered “rare.” I’ve read countless threads about how men are only ever raped by other men, and how it’s a statistical outlier. I’ve seen people say that it’s not nearly as bad or the same as a woman getting raped.

I still have never been able to feel like myself against after that event - even after therapy. I lost my sense of self, my masculinity, and my safety.

I feel invisible, alone and rejected by this world.

Just googled him for the first time in eons and found new news articles.

Now I'm just sitting here laughing at how thoroughly he's fucked up his life. Probation violation :) Actually, twelve of em, but who's counting?

**He has** ***nothing*** **left**.

He has forfeited a high-paying licensed career, almost a decade of life outside prison now, his well-known local reputation, and probably his marriage. And, let's be real: the rest of his future.

And now he has to live out the rest of his life in the wreckage of everything he used to have. Plus 5-10 *extra* years in lockup.

""I'm going to end this man's whole career,"" I seethed ten years ago, helpless and blinded by untreated PTSD.

""It's okay, I'll ruin my own whole life,"" was his reply, apparently.

Life is pretty good nowadays on my end. I don't wake up screaming or begging anymore. I have a lot worth living for. Most days, I'm pretty happy.

Meanwhile, the man who ruined half a dozen lives is probably never going to be happy again. :)

people overuse “ptsd” and “trauma”,"edit #2: i am going to preface this by saying PLEASE actually read my post before leaving a comment about how people shouldn’t decide what is and isn’t trauma. i do not support using trauma as a competition to see whose is worse, and it’s never okay to try and discredit other’s traumatic experiences. i am also 100% NOT saying that an incident is only traumatic if it fits ptsd criteria. this post was only meant to express my frustration with people who use the term ptsd to describe healthy, normal negative feelings, and people who like to make compilations of courage the cowardly dog and call it their “childhood trauma.” if you have any other issues with the post, i’ve probably addressed it in a comment. i don’t want anyone to feel like their experiences are invalid because of what i wrote. so now that i’ve cleared that up, here’s the original post:

it’s so exhausting to see people constantly claim to have ptsd and claim that every. negative. experience. they have had is “trauma.” 

throughout my time on social media i have seen SO many people claim to have ptsd from a significant other cheating, losing a friend due to petty drama, etc. 

i am not trying to invalidate anyone by saying that these experiences aren’t hard and that they can’t be traumatic, and i have no problem with people asking about this to genuinely understand the disorder, but by definition in the DSM you do not qualify for a ptsd diagnosis unless you have been “exposed to one or more event(s) that involved death or threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or threatened sexual violation,” by either you directly experiencing it, witnessing it occur to another person, learning of it happening to a close friend or relative, or being repeatedly exposed to details of a distressing event. 

i am so tired of opening up to people about my PTSD and hearing “oh yeah i have ptsd too, my girlfriend left me for someone else.” like...really? 
do NOT compare me being raped, someone nearly getting killed, or witnessing an act of extreme violence to you having a bad break up. it’s fucking insensitive, minimizing, and plain disrespectful to everyone with a ptsd diagnosis. 

im sorry if this sounded harsh, but i am just so fed up and tired of this shit. it’s hurtful.

edit: i am not talking about people who actually have ptsd and choose to only share smaller events. i am also not saying it’s okay to compare traumas to see who’s is “worse,” and i am not trying to tell people what is and isnt trauma. im just stating that recently people have been throwing the term “ptsd” around the same way they do adhd and ocd, and it’s actually really harmful.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lno9kv/people_overuse_ptsd_and_trauma/,PTSD

"Warning: ""The Body keeps the score"" is a disrespectful and damaging book on PTSD with wide acclaim","So I bought the book ""The body keeps the score"" after it was recommended by a mental health youtuber. And I am disturbed at the cult following this book has gained despite spreading very damaging and false information and views.

I have not read beyond chapter 1 and I don't want to.

&#x200B;

1. Author encourages sympathy for war criminals
2. Author dismisses Vietnamese genocide
3. Author devalues trauma of non-Veteran PTSD victims. This is damaging to the PTSD community as it is a widespread and false stereotype that only Veterans ""deserve"" to claim PTSD. Meaning it goes widely undiagnosed. In reality less than 5% of PTSD sufferers are Veterans. It has taken DECADES to dispell this stereotype and he just reintroduced it. Good job.
4. Author expresses his opinion that the suffering of Veterans is greater than that of rape victims. Which is weird and highly inappropriate for a psychiatrist. It doesn't matter if one persons pain is not as great as another's, they still deserve to seek help. It's made even weirder by how he defends and expresses sympathy for actual rapists. Going as far as saying ""they were traumatised by their own actions"" WTFFFF????
5. That's not trauma, that's guilt. By definition, trauma is something that happens to you, a psychiatrist should know that.
6. Author references the Nazi's but doesn't actually condemn their actions which is suspicious. In fact he seems to be on the wrong side of the Nuremberg trials. While at least the Nazis could claim that they were following orders, the Veterans he defends committed their rape and child murder out of fun
7. He is Dutch, which is where I live. Therefore I know he would have had to read Hannah Arendts ""the banality of evil"" in high school and been exposed to thought experiments and debates on whether following orders counts as warcrime and how much personal responsibility soldiers have since 1st grade. He even grew up during the Nuremberg trial, and claims his father was imprisoned in a concentration camp during WW2. It's not like he is an American who has never been exposed to or had to actually think about these topics. It's like he came up with a strange twisted defence of warcrime to rationalise what happened to his father.
8. The message of the book seems to be ""forgive your rapist, he suffers more from the trauma of your rape than you do""

And don't even get me started on all the scientific inaccuracies and absolute lack of references. All his claims are based on personal experience supported by anecdotes. It referenced discredited techniques, like Rorschach tests, seriously? This book came out in 2016. I legitimately thought this book predates ""Banality of evil"" and the Nuremberg trial considering how immature and underdeveloped his theories are.

Absolute garbage! Hope it gets cancelled before it does more damage to the PTSD community. This is the equivalent of the ""vaccines cause Autism""- paper for PTSD.

EDIT:

Since so many people are trying to gaslight me into denying that what I say actually happens in the book, I wanted to share a quote I found on the goodreads review page of this book, so that you have more than just me as a source that this book is problematic, and that the things I state actually happen in ch1.

"" As a survivor of sexual abuse and trauma, I found this book triggering and lacking the enlightenment I expected, given the reviews. I felt the author showed more compassion for the soldiers who raped and murdered than the rape victims, and the ways in which he discussed the two left me feeling the women weren't as well humanized. Speaking about this with another trauma survivor, she shared that the author was removed from his own trauma center for creating a hostile work environment for women employees. There are articles to confirm it. I rarely—if ever—don't finish a book, but I'm shelving this one. [(less)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693771-the-body-keeps-the-score#) "" sep 2019

EDIT 2

His Rorschach study was plagiarised from a Rorschach study during the Nuremberg Trials on Nazi War criminals. Nothing wrong with repeating a study, but he doesn't credit it whatsoever and portrays it as though he came up with the idea to Rorcharch test war veterans.

Who else is so tired of being in survival mode constantly due to this unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD?,"Who else is so tired of being in survival mode constantly due to this unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD?

I usually am hypervigilant and quick to advocate for myself as a result of my trauma history--racial, sexual, and emotional abuse. I've spent a lot of my life being gaslighted and mistreated. I have become more confident in standing up for myself, setting boundaries and trusting my intuition these days. I love and respect myself and do not tolerate others who abuse or  disrespect my boundaries. I have always been assertive and have leadership qualities, so this is also part of who I am and who I have to be to survive. 

I want to live in a mental and physical space where I can let down my guard and calm my nervous system so I don't feel the need to put all my energy into advocating and fighting back every time with all my force as if I am dealing with racist, sexist, narcissists or sociopathic abusers everytime. This unsafe world is draining my energy as I frequently have to be in survival mode. When I do let my guard down, I am vulnerable to be attacked or preyed on--recently I have been experiencing racial and sexual harassment. 

((The world is not always unsafe of course, Sometimes there are just miscommunications and people are not out to get me or don't have deceitful intentions due to racism, sexism, etc. I have had to check myself when it was time to let an issue go as I am not able to control everything just myself. There have been times I was embarassed for jumping to conclusions and being overly suspicious and mad when someone was not being deceitful and there was a misunderstanding instead.))

I am working on finding safe physical, mental, and spiritual places where I do not feel the need to protect myself as much and can conserve my energy to heal from cPTSD. I cannot expect to heal as effectively when I am in a place where I keep getting burnt by more abuse. I need to be safe first. It is tough though because as a black mixed woman, there are a lot of places where I am not safe and I have to advocate for myself due to people being out to get me or mistreating me. I cannot wait to move next year to a place where I do feel safer and can let my guard down more and can heal my CPTSD.

Who else is struggling with being in survival mode constantly due to this  unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD history? How are you dealing with it?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/hyy2h7/who_else_is_so_tired_of_being_in_survival_mode/,PTSD
It annoys me when trauma survivors say their trauma made them a better and stronger person,"I've never said this to anyone, especially not trauma survivors, but I dislike the belief that trauma molds people into better, stronger people. I think anyone who experiences trauma has a right to feel stronger, more empathetic, braver, etc. if that is what they feel from their unique experience. But it's okay to not feel that way. It's okay to feel angry, sad, scared, hurt, and any negative feeling that comes from experiencing a traumatic event.

I am a survivor of childhood sexual assault and I f-ing refuse to attribute my positive qualities and achievements to those traumas. Before the traumas I was happy, confident, full of life, trusting. The sexual assaults literally altered my body and brain development. My childhood was hell. It was my inherent strength that got me through, not the events themselves. 

Maybe for some people, their trauma helped them see that they were strong and brave all along, but I already knew that about myself BEFORE it happened. I actually lost confidence in myself for not being able to stop the abuse when I tried. 

I'm not some happy, smiling, cheerleader who says, ""Rape made me better"" because it didn't. Maybe for some people, it does, but not for me.

**ETA: I know why some survivors say their trauma helped them grow to be stronger, more thoughtful, and better people BECAUSE they made themselves learn to cope in healthy and beneficial ways which makes them feel stronger as people. There's nothing wrong with that and that is what I agree with. That is an empowering thing to know YOU got YOU through. Not the adversity, but what you did to face it and overcome it. But some people don't attribute their strengths and positive experiences from the trauma(s) itself and that's okay. Everyone's feelings are valid, but we do not all feel the same and should not be lumped together. Please don't invalidate commenters in this thread for discussing their feelings because it's not easy to talk about this.

Annoying trend: Casual use of the term ptsd/triggered in pop culture,"Not to be that overly offended person, but I feel like I've heard a lot of flippant use of the term PTSD lately. Eg: omg that tik tok was so stupid it gave me PTSD, they changed the formula in my favourite lipstick - now I have PTSD, ugh minions are so annoying they gave me PTSD. 

It just rubs me up the wrong way to hear it used as a joke to replace 'annoyed' or 'shocked' or 'having a tantrum'. 

Don't even get me started on the ""hashtagtriggered😋"" stuff.  Like: Oh my god, I hate that girl, I'm so triggered right now #triggeredlol. (I don't mean legit use of triggered, I mean I've seen stupid uses that I feel devalue the actual term and make me hesitant to even use it properly cos I feel stupid saying it.)

Like, occasionally I'll use it meta/ironically in a self deprecating way, to let my partner know I actually am being triggered but don't want to get too emotional about it. I get that being sincere about trauma is hard. But in general, it's just a joke to so many people these days. It grinds my gears 😩


I'm not sure if anyone gets what I mean, but I feel it makes it harder to talk about and even take myself seriously when I'm trying to hard to work through trauma.

I survived a mass shooting 4 weeks ago. I'm an ICU nurse and I can't make it through a full shift without breaking down. I'm afraid and alone and need support,"Throwaway because these details will make me easily identifiable.

I'm an ICU nurse. Covid came to the states right after I got off orientation at my first ICU job. I was working in an inner city safety net hospital. None of my patients had health insurance- they were all well below the poverty line and unable to afford medical treatment, so by the time they came to the hospital, they were essentially already dead. 100% of our intubated covid patients died. Post mortem care was a daily part of my job for quite a long time. We ran out of body bags. We had to stack bodies in the morgue. Unsurprisingly, I was diagnosed with PTSD. I lost almost all my close friends during covid, either because I didn't have the emotional energy to keep up with them, or because we disagreed about masking/vaccines.

But somehow I managed to carry on... I left that job and worked at another, nicer hospital. Then I left that hospital and recently started a job at an even newer, nicer hospital. I got married. Things were starting to look up for me, but I still felt incredibly fragile emotionally. Every day was hard, but I pushed through in the hopes that things would get better.

Then on the fourth of July, I took my husband to see a parade. He is a foreigner who has never been to a fourth of July parade before, and he was so excited to see this part of American culture.

It was the Highland Park parade. I don't really want to go into detail about it, but I will say we were not even five feet away from some of the victims that didn't make it. We were directly in the line of the gunman's fire. We saw and heard and felt things no human is supposed to experience. Miraculously, we got away completely (physically) unharmed.

I took an unpaid leave of absence from work- they only gave me a week. I'm still on orientation and still in the probationary period, so I didn't qualify for FMLA, short term disability, or any of the other benefits I signed up for. I came back to work after that week and lasted until about 12pm, at which point I had a flashback and had to leave my shift. It was super embarrassing, I was a mess and left the unit in tears. I then had a full blown panic attack in the bathroom and it took 45 minutes to compose myself enough to even leave the hospital.

My manager reached out to me and gave me an additional 2 week (unpaid) leave. I desperately needed every minute of that leave, but I felt no more ready when it came time to go back. I made it through 4 shifts without any hitches or problems. But on my 5th shift- yesterday- I just couldn't cope. I had hardly slept- the nightmares wake me up and keep me up. My brain was foggy and I was missing things, fucking things up, and forgetting things I never have. My preceptor confronted me about it, and I completely broke down. I was physically unable to stop crying. My preceptor and I went into my manager's office. They were supportive and told me I don't need to be embarrassed. They let me go home early. But they did tell me that I need to think long and hard about whether or not I can handle this job right now. They can't give me any more time off, since I'm still in orientation. They want me working there... they need staff, and I have experience which few of the other new hires do. But the implication was basically ""either you need to figure out how to be ok and make it through your shifts, or you can't work here anymore.""

Three of my closest friends have told me that my issues are too much for them to deal with and they're not in a place themselves to emotionally support me right now. One friend even said that my texts were ""triggering"" for her and that she didn't want to contact me at all. We'd been friends for 24 years. She's blocked my number now. We were already on rocky terms because we argued about covid, but I thought she'd be willing to put our differences aside in this situation. Guess not.

I have a therapist, a really good one, but it's not enough. the amount of support I need is not support that one sole person can provide. I'm terrified of opening up to my husband in fear that I'll burn him out too... losing a friendship after 24 years has destroyed my sense of trust and my belief that unconditional love exists. My problems have already been ""too much to handle"" for three friends. I feel my trauma has turned me into an emotional vampire and the last thing I want to do is cause my husband- who went through this trauma too- more pain. I don't just ""feel like a burden"", I *am* a burden and have explicitly been told by some of the people closest to me that I'm a burden.

My support system is pretty much just my husband and my therapist right now, and it's just not cutting it. I called a crisis support line today. It was essentially 15 minutes of me hysterically crying. Then the crisis counsellor told me she had to leave. She established I wasn't going to kill myself, and hung up. In my head, I'm thinking to myself, ""Great. Scared another one away.""

I don't know what to do. I don't feel like another job would be any easier for me than this one, so quitting this job and finding another doesn't feel like much of a solution. And I need to work- I'm sponsoring my husband's green card. I worked so hard to get to where I am career wise and I don't want a mass shooter to take that from me.

I don't even know what I'm asking for. I'll take advice, or even just acknowledgement. If you've read this far, thank you. I just needed to be heard and I didn't know where else to turn.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/wl5qpr/i_survived_a_mass_shooting_4_weeks_ago_im_an_icu/,PTSD

I am talking about how in places like Tik Tok, Instagram, X etc people will use these terms to describe literally the most trivial problems or experiences. They have no idea how crippling PTSD is. PTSD has ruled and destroyed my life. I am extremely isolated, I have never had a girlfriend, and I can't hold a job for more than a few months since I was sexually abused as a boy. This disorder is like a cancer for me. There is nothing romantic or trivial about it.

My son has PTSD,"I’m a single father and my son (13) watched his mom die. It was so quick, we didn’t think anything was wrong with her, she just collapsed when I was at work. 

It’s been a few months and he wakes up screaming frequently. Like vocal cord ripping level screams. It takes forever to get him to calm down,afterwards I’ll carry him to my room. It’s horrible. He stays around me and often snuggles with me, I think he’s afraid of losing me. 

He has quick mood changes and blames himself for it. No matter how many time I tell him now one is to blame he never listens. He’s in therapy. 

Just wanted a small vent. It’s breaking me seeing him like this. I love him so much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/g4ee93/my_son_has_ptsd/,PTSD

My boyfriend died in my arms yesterday,"I woke up just like any other day, I turned around to wake him up and he had significant amounts of blood coming out his nose and his body was stiff and he was completely unresponsive. It was all a blur but I tried to resuscitate him after calling 911 but he had already passed. They don’t know the cause of death yet. I laid with him on the ground and snuggled with him one last time before the coroner arrived. I can’t eat or sleep. I’m taking Xanax from the panic attacks. 

All I can think about is his body laying on the floor, completely flushed, and half his face swollen. It was the most horrifying thing I had ever seen and it flashes through my thoughts non stop. He visited me in my dreams last night and said “everything is going to be okay”, but I don’t feel okay, I just need him back with me.

Shoutout to all of the people with PTSD that have horrible memories,"My memory has been deteriorating a lot over the last few months, and I recently learned that it probably stems from trauma.

I’m young, maybe younger than most people on the sub, and memory loss has always been one of my biggest fears. So to learn that PTSD can permanently effect my memory and double my chance of developing dementia later on, is taking a toll on me. 

If anyone else has been affected like this, hi, you’re not alone. Shit sucks but we’ll all get through it.

Edit: I didn't expect this to even hit Hot, but I'm so glad so many of us can relate, and all in different stages of it.

While there was slightly more votes (only about 20) for joining the blackout, the difference was minimal, and important points were raised why we shouldn't join the blackout.

Therefore, the mods of r/ptsd have made the decision not to close or restrict r/ptsd during the protest of the API changes from 12th to 14th of June.  Anything can happen in 48 hours, and for those who may need support most, we don't want to take this platform from them.  Unlike what reddit is doing to people with disabilities.

We do however still support other subreddits going dark temporarily and permanently, and the mods will be individually participing in the protest in other ways.  We invite you to find ways to protest (respectfully) as well.  What reddit is doing is not acceptable and will have detremental effects to the platform.

"Feeling trapped, rapist is getting more famous and I’m struggling to avoid his face","I am struggling a bit this week and trying to mentally prepare for the next few months. My rapist has gotten a little famous over time. He is a political commentator so his profile tends to somehow make it into my news feed/facebook/tik tok even though I avoid politics, blocked him on tik tok, etc. I block and avoid these things to avoid seeing him. The tik tok I saw yesterday he had over 500,000 likes and it’s concerning me he’s getting more famous which means his face will be tormenting me more often. My close friend who I was living with posted him on instagram and when I asked her to take it down in a panic she told me how she thinks he’s so funny. I previously reported him to the police and then again to the FBI. I just don’t want to live like this, it’s so stressful for me. He was my first experience and it was particularly prolonged and violent so it had a huge negative impact on my life and the PTSD was all encompassing. It’s been over a decade since then and I’m just getting frustrated. I keep things a secret from my friends and don’t like to burden people…so I’ve come here…thinking Reddit will have some sort of solution that I haven’t thought of.

a true crime podcast was made about my brothers murder,"
i get it’s public information and people are more curious about the taboo.. i don’t mean to react out of emotion and pain. 
it just hurt so much, they didn’t ask for permission, NO notification.. just made a multiple part podcast … years later.. and it gained enough traction to be sent to my parents and I.. and it really triggered me more than I thought it would and felt blindsiding
and as a younger person- I understood that these podcasts ( even if my sensitivity doesn’t understand the enjoyment) are a thing and there is a huge market.. but I had to explain to my older parents first- what a podcast is, but also how they could be allowed to do this? 
It just hurts so bad. They don’t know rlly how to use their phones , so luckily they can’t play it / fully navigate the site , so I am the one emailing and there was crime scene photos on the website without warning. 
And then, I’m an idiot so I listened. 
It started with an upbeat plug for their merch :D, light banter and even a moment where they described elements of his death “fascinating”…

And it’s such a heavy topic, so I don’t know how to talk about it. I have work tomorrow and I just idk it all feels like so much 

If you read this much, thank you
also- is there a support group for that kind of situation ?

Edit; thank you all so so much for the acceptance, resources and just respect. it means so much..
i do not intend on taking legal action or anything - just rather contact to see if they tried to reach out to us - and then maybe ask them to at least take the crime photos off the website - because it’s one thing for me to have clicked the podcast.. that was my choice.. but the photos on the site is excessive.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/wnw5g1/a_true_crime_podcast_was_made_about_my_brothers/,PTSD

The person who sexually abused me was denied parole with no chance for another hearing!,"The hearing was today. I didn't go but the victims services advocate I've been talking to emailed me about it. I didn't end up writing an impact statement. I tried but it was too triggering so I let the advocate know that and she asked for my permission to tell the parole board that I was too triggered to write an impact statement because that alone gives an idea of the impact. So I told her to tell them and that I also thought they should know that I've been diagnosed with PTSD and I'm in therapy and on antidepressants and anxiety medication and medical marijuana for it.
The email said: ""The reasons for the denial are: nature and circumstances of the offense, injury and impact to the victim’s and inadequate institutional program participation.""
I replied to ask her when he'd be up for parole again and she said: ""He won’t be.  The board denied him with no chance for a re-hear.  There are other means of release thru the department of corrections, please be sure to keep your registration current so that if he applies you will be notified.""
I'm so relieved. 
And he didn't even get to leave prison to go to the courthouse. They did a video conference from the prison.  And no one showed up in support of him or even to do an impact statement. No one he knew cares about him anymore. There's no one who wants him released. He has nothing and no one and I'm glad.
Even if he does get out, there's at least 7 men in my family who own guns and want to shoot him and he's well aware of that so he'd probably stay away.

"Just a tiny rant: I hate how pop psychology and social media has ruined certain terms like 'trauma,' 'disassociation,' and 'intrusive thoughts.'","If you're in the older crowds you might now see this as much but I hate how these words became little trendy quirks to have or use as memes on social media. I've also kind of just resented how they've become part of mainstream vernacular and not in a good way you know? 

For example I saw someone describe an incident where their friend read their journal too their crush in 7th grade as ""traumatizing"" like...genuinely they believe they have trauma from this. It's really insulting and frusterating you know? Like yeah that would be VERY embarrassing and mortifying but like C'mon. You're an adult now, build a bridge and get over it. There's ""Don't compare your trauma to others,"" and then there's shit like that. It just irks me when people act like every tiny hardship in their life is ~trauma~. No. You don't know what that word means. That word actually means something to people and to mental health professionals.

I also hate how terms like ""disassociate"" or ""intrusive thoughts"" became a quickly personality trait and then memes. Because even though my psychologist has identified these for me and said that what I'm experiencing, I still don't like to say that's what I'm experiencing. Like I feel like I'm making it up to be quirky or be funny or some shit. But it's not...I will struggle with talking to my therapist about having trouble with intrusive thoughts or not knowing where I was the last 4 fucking hours because I got triggered and disassociated.

I wish people understood the way triggers work,"Although lots of my triggers are very reasonably “scary” things, lots of them are also seemingly innocent or harmless. I don’t really talk about my PTSD but the few times I commented on something being “triggering”, I got laughed at. I wish people understood that I’m not traumatized by something “silly”; rather, that thing is somehow a reminder of a much much uglier part.

Just because something is a trigger, doesn’t mean that particular thing gave me PTSD. I’m not a “snowflake” that got traumatized by something so trivial, ANYTHING can be a trigger. A word, a smell, a picture, a concept, literally anything. Even a puppy can be a trigger. A trigger doesn’t have to be something blatantly ugly. 

It seems like people confuse the trauma with the things that trigger it, such as flashbacks and what not. They’re nowhere near the same thing.

"The word ""trigger""","It really irritates me that the word ""trigger"" or ""triggered"" has been turned into a joke and a meme and people just casually throw it around whenever something is mildly inconvenient.
Then when I try to explain to people what my triggers are, they treat it as if I'm just being overdramatic because of the contexts in which they normally see the word.
It makes me feel self-conscious about asking someone not to do something because it's triggering since I worry that people who don't know what I have been through will assume I'm just an overly sensitive person who needs to ""get over it""",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/cemx2h/the_word_trigger/,PTSD

My dog saved my life today,"TW talk of suicide


I had written a note, made plans, I woke up sobbing this morning and just couldn't bear it any more, i was just so overwhelmed. And she just kept bumping me with her nose and getting me to look at her and trying to lick my tears away. Eventually I decided if I was going to do it, I would need to set her up to be more comfortable for the day (its really hot here) and got up and moved to go and set her up her bed and food in a different cooler part of the house. Moving helped a little bit, but I was still in that headspace. She wouldn't settle until I came and sat on the sofa with her, and she just laid out staring at me. Something about the look I her eyes was just so innocent and pure and it set me off crying and sobbing again, the idea that she wouldn't know what had happened to me if I killed myself. I decided to take a nap, I figured if I was going to do it anyway then who cares of I slept till 3pm anyway first. I woke up calmer. Sure the whole day was wasted sleeping but i woke up at the end of it...I came down from bed and sat with her on the sofa after and I don't know... I just really think if she hadn't have been here I would have done something to myself.

PTSD is NOT a mental disorder. It's a mental injury.,"It just isn't. It flat out isn't a disorder, at least not to me. It's a mental injury. A mental scarring, a wound that is having such a hard time closing. There's actually people advocating out there for the name to be changed. I think PTSD can attribute to the development of mental disorders, but to me PTSD in and of itself is an injury. Also part of ptsd being a mental injury is the fact that it can be healed, treated and alot of times fully cured. Its been shown time and time again to be highly treatable just through therapies alone and in some cases goes away on its own with no intervention. Also mind the fact, regardless of the behaviors it causes, PTSD has actuay been shown to still be a normal trauma response.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/oe2b57/ptsd_is_not_a_mental_disorder_its_a_mental_injury/,PTSD

My family does not understand PTSD. Most if them don't believe it is a real thing.

A shooting happened at our hardware store the other day""

I do not expect everybody in my life to cater to my needs or walk on eggshells because of my PTSD. I do, however, expect someone like my Uncle to use common sense and not send me something that obviously hits way too close to home.

My mom was bi-polar, an alcoholic and addict. My dad traveled for work and when he was home, he ignored what was happening. I spent most of my childhood being the protector of my younger brother.

Anyway, I’ve had anxiety and depression my whole life (as far back as I can remember), but this past year it has been particularly bad. Inpatient stays, outpatient, therapy, etc. A few weeks ago, I started having flashbacks, and my mind just can’t stop thinking of the things that happened. 

I’ve been angry. At first, it was towards my mom, but lately I just feel angry at myself. I think things like, “did this even happen? why am I making such a big deal out of this? Do I just want attention? Do I just want to feel bad for myself? I didn’t know exactly what was causing my anxiety and depression, so have I just resorted to blaming it on my childhood? Was it even that bad? I just need to suck it up, stop thinking about it, it’s over and I’m fine.”

Do people assume you’re “dumb” or “slow” because of trauma symptoms?,"
Do people assume you’re “dumb” or “slow” because of trauma symptoms?

I’ve been called slow and dumb my whole life. A lot of people think I am ditzy and an airhead. Often I’m not aware what is going on in the present moment because I am in my head (anxiety, dissociation, ruminating thoughts). I often will have slow responses to people because I am emotionally dysregulated, I was distracting myself and/or hypervigilant as I try to read the person/situation (I try to figure out if I am safe and can trust them). When I get dysregulated, I often freeze and forget what I am doing. I know my cPTSD symptoms are a big reason I appear “slow” because when I take a mood stabler, a lot of those symptoms go away. I also I wonder if having cPTSD for so long had changed my brain so I am slower and have a slower processing speed.
It bothers me a lot when I get patronized and treated like I’m slow/dumb. Sometimes people think I am lying when I say I went to graduate school. Also, sometimes I attract manipulative, insecure and sexist men who like to feel like they are superior and try to infantilize me because they think I’m

"I don't like them taking away the word ""victim"".","There's a real push in PC culture right now for not just people with PTSD but rape and abuse victims also to not call themselves ""victim"" but rather ""survivor"". The problem with that is, I WAS victimized. That kind of language benefits the people who harm us, because if they see us as ""survivors"" than they can go on abusing us and it's like it doesn't matter. You can do anything to a ""survivor"". Also, it shames people coming forward because the word ""victim"" has become negative and shameful. I think instead of replacing ""victim"" with another word, we should be making it so that ""victim"" is not a shameful thing to be. You hear whining mostly on the right, mostly aimed at women, about people, mostly women, accused of ""playing the victim"". The solution to that isn't to call yourself something else, but to assert that yes, I am a victim, but no I am not playing or pretending. This all actually happened to me. If I were a ""survivor"" I feel like that just makes me violable because I'm then expected to be ""tough enough"" to ""handle it"". It puts pressure on victims by telling US to get over it and cope and be strong, rather than pressuring abusers to change THEIR shitty patterns of behavior. I understand that individual people might like feeling like a ""survivor"", but I feel like the label is toxic because it's telling the victims how to approach handling being victimized. I do want to be a victim, because I was one, and fuck anyone telling me what to call myself. 

This was also brought up in the second season of *Thirteen Reasons Why*, and I thought, like many mental health issues in that show, that it was handled in such a garbage way. Basically, a main character was raped while under the influence of alcohol at a party. She has a hard time getting over it. A feminist in charge of a ""rape survivors"" group tells her to join them ""when you're ready to stop being a victim and start being a survivor"". In other words, her shaming the character into being the right kind of ""strong survivor"" type of person, and being sad was seen as weak. She was also shaming her into going forward with legal action against her rapist. The show acted like it was important that she do that, no sympathy for victims who do not report. I feel like this is reflective of larger problems with society wanting everyone to always project an aura of strength and confidence, where we bully, ridicule, and shame people for being weak or emotionally damaged.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/f18z9g/i_dont_like_them_taking_away_the_word_victim/,PTSD

I don't want to drag this on so to put it shortly: my mom did bad things to me when I was little. I visited my hometown and lived with her for a few months recently and it was a nightmare. I started feeling sick and my relationship with my mom was just as bad as it had always been growing up. When I went home I was still sick and I was supposed to start treatment for PTSD once I got into therapy again. I watched her hurt my dad over and over as a kid. She took me in the shower and told me I smelled bad that I wasn't showering right, and she would touch me and threaten me. She told me to kill myself and to hurt myself so many times. She was on drugs most of my lifetime. I stopped talking to her because she was my trigger and I had no respect left for her. She tried to contact me and taunt me saying she was going to take my tax money again, I called and my aunt picked up, I was very upset and started yelling. I sent my mom a long text message, confronting her about everything she did to me, it wasn't very nice but I was so angry. I told her I hoped she would never die. My family saw the text and told me they'd believe me no matter what, to tell them what my mom did to me, specifically about the sexual abuse. I was already broken down I just told them everything. They didn't believe me and got angry for accusing my mother of such things. My mom sent me a picture of a gun to her head, and I did not respond. I did not want to talk to her anymore.

I’m fucking sick of it. I get that it works for some people and that’s fine. So do medications and and therapy, but that shit doesn’t work for me. And neither does weed or psychedelics.

Every single time I’ve smoked weed it made me paranoid and agitated and kinda angry and I hated it. I always get the response that I just need to “try a different strain” or some shit. Well to my knowledge, I’ve never smoked the same one twice and I don’t live in a country where it’s legal at all so we don’t have dispensaries or anything either. Not about to move countries to try different weed either, even if it was a possibility right now.

LSD was even worse, had the most fucked up, traumatising experience the first time I did it and I’m never gonna touch psychedelics again after that. It was fucking horrible. People always say you’ve gotta “be in a good headspace” and “in a good environment” and “with people you trust”. Well what if you’re never in a good headspace? What if you hate the whole fucking world? What if you don’t have any friends or anyone you trust? They never explain that part.

Am I a Karen for being a little bothered when people without PTSD joke about having it? (Honest opinions pls),"Sorry if the title is confusing- I’m not trying to be a Karen here or hyper sensitive but it sort of rubs me the wrong way when a friend or family member of mine joke about them having PTSD when they don’t. For example, if my friend opened a new bag of chips and it exploded everywhere they might say the next time they open a bag “I’m going to be so careful this time I have PTSD from the last time it exploded”. Or if someone gets a bad haircut and says “I’m going to a new hair salon and I’m nervous, I have PTSD from the last place messing up”. I feel like this is a regular line I hear people around me say. I wouldn’t be offended honestly at all if they were strangers who didn’t know I actually have PTSD,  but these are people that DO know. I never say anything about it to them, it’s not like it enrages me. It just makes me a little uncomfortable and kind of squirm at the insensitive comment. I just wish people would be a little more aware of what they’re saying around certain people. I don’t feel personally offended, I know they aren’t trying to poke at me, but it does make me feel a little invalidated. It makes me wonder if they think it’s something silly to joke about and not something that totally fucked me up. Thoughts?? Am I being too sensitive?? Again this only about people who literally do know I have PTSD.

Edit: I’m Gen Z, I’m fully aware of what a Karen is and that this isn’t really the appropriate use of the word. I think a better phrase would be a nagging Nancy -I just meant am I being like an annoying person 

Side comment if you’re interested: 
Thank you all for being respectful in the comments, regardless of your opinion. I posted this exact post on an AITAH thread for about 30 minutes and the comments were filled of extremely demeaning and awful comments. Not just calling me an asshole for being bothered by this, but going on to say extremely insensitive comments about people with PTSD and calling me “triggered” in a derogatory way. Like totally disregarding the actual question I asked and making it into a space to bash and invalidate and make a mockery of PTSD. like insinuating that it isn’t even a real disorder (wtfffff).  Basically telling me that I have to deal with whatever people say or call me because of “free speech”. I ended up taking it down and just keeping the post up here because of it. It didn’t bother me that people were saying I was in the wrong, but the hurtful and arrogant comments were ridiculous. Just goes to show that most people have no idea what PTSD is. They think it’s about as big as someone going to war and being scared of fireworks after. Which everyone in this subreddit can vouch could not be further from the reality we live every day. It makes me really sad that people aren’t only uneducated on the topic, but unwilling to learn. PTSD is such a heavy and all consuming disorder, and it’s constantly shit on. I wish there were more organizations or promo of PTSD awareness. I felt so alone and overwhelmed until I started reading these comments. People who are educated on the topic, whether they think I’m being over sensitive or if they agree with me, are still respecting my trauma and not bashing my mental illness.

"Does anyone else get ""imposter syndrome"" with their ptsd?","I put imposter syndrome in quotes because im using it for lack of a better phrase. 

I don't know if it's because I've always been extremely uncomfortable with expressing emotions/witnessing displays of emotion, but when I have a a flashback or an episode I feel like I'm being really overdramatic. Like I'm being very performative and I have this voice in my head telling me that I'm being way too dramatic, to reign it in and that I'm obviously just faking it for attention. This also come along with me downplaying things which is a coping mechanism of mine. Like telling myself my trauma ""isn't even that bad"" or that it doesn't warrant PTSD etc. 


Now I can rationalise these thoughts because my physical symptoms aren't fake. I can't stop the shaking and the hyperventilating. I also hate attention/being fussed over, if anything I get extremely embarrassed. But I was wondering if this is a typical thing?

I identify more with 'victim' than with 'survivor',"Last year I was having some counselling sessions for my trauma while waiting for help from mental health services, and my counsellor was totally baffled when I said that I identified more with the word victim than the word survivor. She asked, isn't survivor more empowering?

For some people it is, but not for me. I'm not a survivor,  I wasn't struck by lightning, I didn't have cancer, I didn't 'survive' a random event. I'm a victim, not because I'm weak or belittled, but because this was *done to me by another person.* My trauma was a deliberate act done to me by someone else, they deliberately victimised me, and I need to process it as such. 

The word 'victim' has such horrifying stigma, and - don't get me wrong - replacing it with 'survivor' is crucial to other PTSD sufferers' self-definition. But for me it has never sat right. There's an assumption even in trauma services that calling yourself a victim is limiting yourself, or not being strong, having the tendency to see yourself as weak, or not acknowledging how you've powered through it all. Often it's the idea that once you see yourself as a victim or 'victimise yourself' you become pathetic, oversensitive, overreactive, less capable, less than. But I'm none of those things.

I can't process my trauma without accepting and being vocal about its origins. I didn't 'survive' this, because it isn't over. But accepting that I was someone's victim doesn't mean I'm all of the negative connotations of 'victim'.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/r9il8e/i_identify_more_with_victim_than_with_survivor/,PTSD

"People have such burning hatred for poor people, and it's extremely..... upsetting","I suffer from PTSD from mutiple different things in my life, but one of the most intense and horrifying to remember is when I was homeless for a year. 

In America at least (though Im sure in other places as well), once you become homeless or in poverty, you're no longer a part of ""society"". You're not a ""member of society"", you're a Burden. A 'leech', for needing anything, anything at all, even something as small as a listening ear or breadcrumb. It's an offense to even suggest you may need help, to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you. Because in their eyes, you must have done something to ""deserve"" poverty, or homeless. It's like a moral branding to them. It doesn't matter how you became severely poor/homeless, and it doesnt matter how desperately you're fighting to survive/escape your circumstances. ""Poor/homeless"" is all they need to know to ""know"" that you're unworthy of help, or of compassion. You're the scum beneath their feet. You're not even human.

Even after being homeless and tormented for a year, and then in poverty for 4, I still feel myself become crushed under the weight of people's disgust for poor/homeless people. It utterly shocks me. It steals the breath from my lungs. 

The internet is full of cruelty and anger, obviously, but..... it's not just on the internet, anyways, not by a longshot. People are not shy about their disgust for poor people, and if you haven't been in extreme poverty you may not have even noticed how bad it is. You may have some deeply rooted hatred and judgement inside you, too. 

It's. horrifying. And it brings me back to the most horrifying days/experiences of my life. I think i had a conclusion to this, but i feel like a child again, starving and absolitely terrified and being proven to that even the mostly seemly compassionate or kind people will turn on you the moment you have no money. The moment you become """"worthless"""". 

Here's a conclusion i guess,,, Anyone else traumatized by poverty/homelessness, or more specifically, how people treated you because you were in poverty/homeless",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/f6zhl4/people_have_such_burning_hatred_for_poor_people/,PTSD
My patient died a violent death and I think I have PTSD from it,"Tldr: He suffered a cardiac tamponade that led to sudden onset hypotension, and his IV got pulled out, which led to hypovolemic shock.

The patient had come to the hospital, complaining of severe chest pain and weakness, and had said he suffered clots before, so he was given blood thinners to treat it. Around 12:50 AM i got a call from his room. It was his wife, screaming about excessive bleeding and her husband throwing up. 

I stepped into his room, and it was like a scene straight out of a horror movie. I truly do not mean to crassly compare it to something like but I have no idea how else to express it. As soon as I stepped into his room I went into instant panic mode because of what I saw. I froze up. My mind went blank.

His bed was so saturated in blood  that it went through all of his linens and was covering the mattress. His blankets were so soaked that it was dripping on to the floor. His gown was completely black because he was so bleeding out so much. His IV had been torn out of his arm and he was just pouring blood everywhere.

I tried so hard to stop it. The floor was slick with his blood that I fell and nearly split my own head open trying to get to the emergency staff button. I tried so hard. The towels. The gauze. There just so much bleeding that it went through everything.

His face turned so white. I had never seen anything so terrifying in my life. All i can see when I close my eyes is the color draining from his face.

His blood pressure went from 127/79 to 42/30. He was dead at 1:35 AM.

I don't know what to do. I've changed my clothes. I've written this out. I cried. But all I can think of is all that blood. His dying face. He was shaking so much.

He came in and was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism when he had a cardiac tamponade and we gave him blood thinners for a clot that didn't exist.

I can't help but think we killed him. I can't stop thinking what if I had gotten there a few minutes earlier? What if I hadn't froze at the door? Maybe I could have prevented his IV from being ripped out. Maybe I could hace saved his life. My mind is tearing itself apart. I feel sick thinking about it. I had his blood running down my arms. The sound of his,wife screaming at me to stop his bleeding.

PTSD: A condition that has to be “believed”,"Wow. I’m just realizing that there are conditions people suffer from that are mostly indisputable, like, a broken leg for example, or a knife wound. For the most part, you’re not going to go to someone for help with these conditions and be dismissed or told “it’s all in your head” or “there is no such thing as a broken leg, grow a pair.” 

But with PTSD, the burden of proof is usually on us. And often, despite providing overwhelming evidence, it’s still not always believed that we have it. 

And on top of all of that, the more people do not believe in our symptoms the more we are likely to question them ourselves. Which is almost even more tragic. That we can inhabit a body that is clearly reacting to the environment in a way that can be disabling for us, and yet we can sometimes question even our own sanity…",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/p1ozdg/ptsd_a_condition_that_has_to_be_believed/,PTSD

Healing from PTSD has been the hardest but most important job I've ever had! I am so glad my real job is so low key that I am able to have more time to take care of myself.

There is a lot of crucial energy and time spent trying to heal from trauma such as processing the emotions from trauma during hard dreams/ triggers/flashbacks, educating myself about the abuse, the self care, mental health care, leaving toxic relationships, isolating, learning and setting boundaries, self parenting, etc ..

This hard work is paying off and I am so proud of myself and glad I love and care about myself enough to do it. I will never give up on myself, I am my number one advocate and supporter.

Update on predator lurking this sub. TW CSA,"I’ll try keep it short because we had a post like this not too long ago but I’ve got new info I wanted to share. 

There is a person lurking this sub who has gone by previous usernames such as “coder” and “isusha”. They started by messaging me with something along the lines of “hey I saw your post on X and I was hoping I could just vent to you. Awaiting your reply” 

They say they are a minor being abused. When you engage them they are extremely insistent on NOT calling CPS or the cops. They say they just want to vent and they eventually just want to describe the abuse to you. 

I didn’t report it immediately because i was worried it might be an actual confused child :(
But another user messaged me the other day saying she had received the exact same kind of messages from “coder” (his old username). 

I think it’s safe to say this person is going to a lot of these subs and messaging people. Since they have created new usernames and deleted old ones I also think it’s safe to say they will continue this behavior. 

I’m sure there are other people like this lurking as well. I just wanted to share this persons particular narrative and method to help you guys identify them if they try writing you from a new username. 

Stay safe everyone. I know this sucks but we are adults now who can make safe choices and I am trying to see this as an opportunity to practice setting boundaries, and standing up to creeps. The younger me would have given this abuser endless empathy and tried to help them/given them the benefit of the doubt that they were a child in need.

I just found out my father is a narcissistic pedophile.,"Welp. I went to family therapy to try to work out all the demons caused by my parents for covering up my brothers repeated violent sexual assault of me when i was a child from the ages of 5-14.

Their true, screaming “YOU BRING ME NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS, YOURE DESTROYING THE FAMILY, I WISH I NEVER HAD KIDS, I WISH I WAS DEAD.” selves.

We went to therapy and I had suspected the truth but I could not believe it until I had confirmation. My brothers abuse has been hid from everyone in his life including his wife. To ask an oblique question I asked my mom, “What would you do if you found out Dad was a pedohpile?” My question was to her but my eyes were on him. 

The shock.

My heart sank.

I gave my brother an out not an excuse to explain the chain of abuse. 

“Did dad sexually assault you?” Crawled out of me. 

“Yes.”

"I was stabbed 18 times and pushed off a cliff, and that was the easy part","I was attacked while hiking in Honolulu in 2009. An individual had a psychotic break and thought Japanese men wearing blue were government agents sent to kill him. I was stabbed 18 times, mostly in the head and throat, and pushed off the top of Koko Crater. I fell 100 feet. I broke my neck, fractured my skull, both my lungs collapsed, my left lung was punctured, my liver and diaphragm were stabbed, an artery in my temple was severed.
I lost 5 pints of blood. I was lucky to survive, there have been a few challenges along the way. 

I was rear-ended twice while recovering from the broken neck. I was betrayed by the justice system. My attacker was acquitted due to temporary insanity and was put in a mental hospital.
Just 3 years after trying to murder 2 people, he was granted permission to take college courses at a nearby community college unescorted.
He was released in 2018 and gets free healthcare for life. 

In 2021, I was diagnosed with lipodystrophy, a rare metabolic disorder that causes complete fat loss.
Every ounce of fat disappears and your organs slowly shut down. I haven’t laid on my back in 2 years and I haven’t sat voluntarily in 2 years because my butt fat is gone. Most of my life is spent laying on my stomach. 

It won’t surprise you that I have PTSD, what might surprise you is that the trauma from my stabbing is a drop in the bucket compared to the trauma of chronic illness. I survived and even overcame maybe the most violent attempted murder ever committed, and yet I’m taken down by a rare metabolic disorder. Life without fat is exponentially more painful than getting stabbed and pushed off a cliff. Crazy, right? 

People ask how I’ve survived all this trauma. The answer is simple: I’m half Japanese and half  Scandinavian. That means I’m a samurai AND Viking. It’s hard to kill one, but I’m both! 

This is a challenging situation and I worry about the future, but I post this to remind you of the strength of the human spirit. I hope this part inspires you: that lunatic tried to stab my brain 6 times. What did I do with that brain? I went back to school and I graduated with a 4.0 and $90,000 in scholarships. I became a published author and wrote and spoke about my survival throughout Hawaii and California. I knit thousands of scarves, beanies, and potholders and sold them to pay for medical bills. I fought for victim’s rights, and I supported victims and survivors through their trials. I did all these things with PTSD, OCD, anxiety, and severe chronic pain.

"Abuse victims with PTSD, have you guys also noticed how abuse is used for comedy in media?","It's kinda painful to see what causes me so much heartache used in comic relief. I've mostly seen this with emotional and physical abuse. For example, i remember seeing good luck Charlie as a kid and seeing how neglected Gabe was. He was the 3rd out of 5 siblings, but the parents treat the other 4 kids with more love and attention than him. Causing him to act out and be a delinquent. (And Disney loves to copy this dynamic into other shows)
A more recent example I've seen is in my favorite game Persona 5 the Royal, the character Ryuji had already been physically abused by his dad and coach, then his friends casually called him ""stupid"" and beat up on him. There's even a controversial scene in the original Persona 5 where Ryuji is implied to get assaulted by two stereotypical gay men. And this isn't the first example of a character abused for comedy in the history of Atlus games.

"""The Body Keeps the Score"" is probably the most comprehensive and easiest to read book on PTSD","I've posted about this book before on /r/ptsd , but it helped me so much, I think it bears reposting. The book came out in 2015, so its relatively new. It was written by a psychologist who attempted to treat PTSD in Vietnam Veterans in the early 1970s and has been trying to understand trauma of all forms for his entire career. It is written partly as a description of his career and the technological developments that helped doctors understand trauma, but it also goes into great detail describing the physical mechanisms of trauma and how to overcome them. And yes, you can overcome them.

I have PTSD from a near death experience that landed me in a 9 day medically induced coma. In trying to recover, I kept meeting people talking about 'energy' or memories living in our muscles and it just always felt confusing or vague and even more disempowering. This book REALLY demystified a lot of these concepts for me and helped me believe for the first time that not only were my problems understandable, but that there were practical things that I could do to move beyond them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/cxhu5q/the_body_keeps_the_score_is_probably_the_most/,PTSD
A therapist isn’t necessarily dismissing your trauma by not giving you a PTSD diagnosis ,"Several times a week I see a post stating that someone’s therapist has decided not to give them a diagnosis for PTSD for xyz reason. The conclusion many people come to is that the therapist is dismissing their trauma, they are a bad therapist, or that they are simply uninformed. 

While it is incredibly important to advocate for yourself, we are also not entitled to a diagnosis simply because we think we have it. There are so many differential diagnoses that carry similar symptoms to PTSD and are trauma related disorders that may be a better fit. You may also have gone through a trauma, have symptoms, but not quite meet the criteria for PTSD. 


I urge people to really consider how they feel about their therapist overall and how they respond to their pain when it’s brought up in session. Recognize a pattern of dismissing and go from there. 

And it’s worth considering in the comments section that more harm then good can come from telling people whom you don’t know that their therapist is awful and dismissing them without a fair amount of evidence for it. Because if that’s not true, the person will carry the belief that yet another person doesn’t care about them or their trauma. Even if the therapist does care and is still working through the trauma and symptoms of it. 

Of course, advocate for yourself, seek a second opinion if needed. Always be aware if a therapist IS dismissing you. But please recognize a therapist’s job is to decipher all your symptoms and give you a diagnosis that’s the best fit. And sometimes, it may not be the diagnosis you think you have or are wanting to have. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1eouzef/a_therapist_isnt_necessarily_dismissing_your/,PTSD

tired of weed being suggested as a “cure all” for my ptsd symptoms,"weed sends me into paranoid episodes where i heavily disassociate or think someone is trying to hurt me and no matter how much i assert that i’ve always had bad experiences with weed, people continue to suggest it to me as this like “magical cure” for all my symptoms. (someone even told me to stop going to therapy and just smoke instead lol?) i’m really glad that it  helps some people a lot, but it’s honestly not for everyone.

edit: i see some people misinterpreting my point so i’ll say again that i’m not implying that weed or other substances don’t help people, it’s just hurtful when people refuse to take no for answer and try to pressure you to do it, whether that’s through friends or dms. i’m glad some people have good experiences and want other people to as well, but it’s not helpful to nag someone about it if they say no, especially when it’s a stranger.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/dw47dw/tired_of_weed_being_suggested_as_a_cure_all_for/,PTSD

All dentists (and their assistants) need to be taught about mental health,"New dental office: “Do you have any medical conditions?”

Me to assistant: “Yes, I have PTSD.”

Assistant: “Oh, ok, are you on any medication for it?”

Me: “No.”

Assistant: “Then it shouldn’t matter, it’s just a cleaning after all.”

Sigh…at least they were receptive when I told them that yes, actually, it does matter because *insert mini lecture on hypervigilance, sensory overload, startle response, being in a vulnerable position while people you just met are in your personal space…*

Ugh. I know this is petty, but ugh.

ETA: To be clear, I am not blaming the assistant - they just didn’t know better and needed to be educated. I’m annoyed that dental schools don’t recognize the importance of teaching dental professionals about these things, and more broadly, that mental health is seen as irrelevant to other areas of health. And also, sometimes I get annoyed at how PTSD affects literally every part of my life and I constantly have to explain it to medical professionals and if I don’t explain it in the right way, I sometimes get dismissed or disbelieved or otherwise treated badly by those medical professionals.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10dw7ue/all_dentists_and_their_assistants_need_to_be/,PTSD
My grandmother is dying and I could not care less. Fuck her and that time she tried to kill me.,"I don’t even know where to begin.  My grandmother is the most toxic and vile person that I have ever come across.  Not only just in real life either, but even across movies and TV shows.  I can’t think of a more disgusting repulsive human being.  

My first ever memory from my childhood is of her beating the shit out of me.  I couldn’t have been more than 6 years old.  I was on the couch in the fetal position trying to cover my head whilst taking shots.  Then I blacked out.  

This is about par for the course for grandma.  In my family they say, “oh it’s just grandma being grandma.  Just don’t think about it.”

I guess that’s just what you say when you’ve spent a life time taking beatings from this fucking midget ogre.  I hear my mom and her sisters took beatings even worse than we did.  I still remember her losing her mind and beating the living pulp out of my brother and my cousin.  My grandpa had to tackle her and restrain her on numerous occasions.  Prying whatever object out of her hands that she decided would be the tool she would use to beat us with; Broom handle, wooden beating paddle, bare knuckles with rings, didn’t matter. 

It’s not like we were the worst kids in the entire fucking world either.  Like we deserved to be beaten that way.  All you had to do was look at her funny, or say something in the wrong tone, or disagree with her, or express your feelings, or just simply exist and be around her.  Didn’t matter.  If she wanted to dish out a beating, simply because she felt like it, well then you were going to catch a beating.  

For some reason, everybody in my family still supports and sympathizes with this tragic waste of human life.  I can only imagine this must be due to Stockholm syndrome.  I sure as hell don’t fucking understand it.  Fuck her.  

The first and only time that I (or anybody for that matter) ever tried to stand up to her I almost died.  She was calling my girlfriend a slut because she liked to wear thigh high skirts.  I told her so what, I like the way she dresses and that’s all that matters.  She told me her parents should be ashamed of her, I interrupted her and told her “yeah but you’re not her parents,  she can do whatever she wants and she can wear whatever she wants.  You are not her mother.”  Grandma screams at me “EXCUSE ME!  DONT YOU EVER TALK TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER THAT WAY!  YOU LISTEN AND SHUT UP!”  To which I carelessly and recklessly replied “fuck you, go fuck yourself.  Nobody cares what you think”

She grabbed the biggest knife out of the kitchen, at minimum a 12” kitchen utility knife, and trotted her fat ass right towards me.  Fire burning in her eyes.  I jumped out of my chair and threw it behind me in the hopes that it would get in her way and slow down her chase.  She stops at the other end of the kitchen table.  I’m at the opposite corner, trapped.  I instinctively grab the other chairs and pull them out, hopping I can use them some how to escape.  We play a game of cat and mouse.  Jab stepping both left and right to see who is going to make the first move.  The stupid bitch takes my bait and goes right to where I faked, I dip and go around the other way.  She lunges at me over the chairs and table, swiping at me with the giant fucking blade in her hand.  I narrowly escape.  I dip and bend my torso to avoid her savage attempts at murdering me.  I sprint down the hall to my room.  I try to shut the door but she’s right behind me trying to push it back open. I shove the door back into her and just barely get it to close behind me.  I lock the door handle whilst she kicks, punches, and stabs at the door.  All while screaming and screeching that she’s going to fucking kill me.  

I call the police.  They arrive moments later.  I’ve already packed a bag of my necessities.  I just want to get the fuck out of dodge.  The cops escort me out as my my grandmother screams and yells to the cops to arrest me, to kick me out of her house.  I walk out quietly and tell the cops I just want to leave and go to my friends house.  They oblige.  

This woman, my grandma, this piece of shit Is the reason that I suffer from PTSD.  I don’t believe in a heaven or a hell, there is no reasoning or justice for the bull shit that she’s put me through, but I hope she spends eternity suffering a miserable existence.  I don’t care what or where that is, just make her as miserable as she’s made the rest of this world.  

Fuck you grandma you lousy piece of shit.  I don’t give two shits about your final days here on earth.  I hope it hurts, I hope you regret everything.  I will never forgive you.  You are not my family.  We may be related by blood, but you are not my family.  I get to choose the people in my family.

Think the stigma ever goes away? Think again.,"Two nights ago I had a pretty uncomfortable conversation with one of my best friends. I’m not sure if this necessarily has changed our friendship but it just reinforces that there is a long way to go with society’s view of mental health issues - especially in healthcare where they are “supposed” to at least show some compassion in treatment.

But anyways, my friend is an ER nurse and no lie she works in a pretty rough spot. I know she’s got to see some shit every hour. I get that. I’m a school teacher at a rough school too. I get frustrated with shit. I know with my ptsd, I might have something in common with the harder students. So I keep an open mind and heart.

Anyways, that’s why it was hard when my friend started laughing and talking about one of the patients that came in. She gave me details, it was basically a man who was suffering at first what they thought was hallucinations/paranoia. Turns out he was a war veteran and experiencing severe flashbacks, talking to himself, screaming, flailing, you get the picture. 

I was shocked at her tone and how she was laughing, I suppose out of shock herself because she had to help restrain the man and called the cops to transport him to a different psych hospital. At the end of her story, I just said “Don’t you think that could’ve been me? What’s so funny about that?”

I could tell immediately she was thrown off and she just started insisting that no, mine was different and blah, blah, blah. Like no. That man and I might have different symptoms/circumstances but we’re still in the same boat. How am I supposed to feel when a health care professional has that attitude - and when that person knows the delicate details of my own condition? 

Sorry for this rant but I suppose I needed to get it off my chest. As I’m wondering how far we have to go in order to get people to understand us, have sympathy. We don’t choose our triggers, we can’t wish the trauma away. We can’t put a band aid on our brains.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/h0adkq/think_the_stigma_ever_goes_away_think_again/,PTSD
I'm a man who was raped by a woman,"I understand most people don't take this seriously. The first and only time I have ever told anyone else outside of writing it here, I was told ""So, you got laid. Coolio. Good for you! There's no way you didn't like it. She's hot, man, how was it?!"" Had I been a young female, I think my friend's reaction and people's reaction would be different. But because I'm a man, I like sex, apparently.

Anyway, I was in college and starting to deal with my childhood traumas. I opened up to a woman not much older than me for the first time about that stuff. We were in class and tasked with writing a personal story and share it with our partner for feedback with regards to the style of poetry we were told to use. The first red flag should have been when she asked ""Are you **sure** you were abused as a kid?"" When I defended myself gently, she apologized very much and so forth. During our break, we got a coffee and she leaned in to kiss me. I leaned back and apologized, saying that I wasn't comfortable with being intimate with anyone that I wasn't at least a year or more into a relationship, and how I was also the type to save sex for marriage."" ""Sure you are."" She said smiling. She forced herself on me, kissing me, and I caved. Anxiety. Fear, my body saying yes while my mind was trying to escape in fear.

Long story short, we had a back-and-forth love/hate relationship and I was too spineless and weak to break out a partnership in class off. She needed my help with something one night at her house, and she paid me for it. All good. But then she pushed me on the sofa, took our clothes off... and I'll leave the rest up to your imagination. I felt broken, nearly crying in front of her, but then played it off as anxiety and anger, scurrying out of her home, barely putting my clothes back on before exiting the door. 'Was that good for you too, baby?"" She said when she saw me leaving. When I'd tried to fight her off initially, she was like ""I always control the situation. Why would you fight me? Just let it happen, let me ride you, you might like it since you're a virgin, I promise you'll be safe. Learn from your past punishment.""

I'm pretty logical. I haven't done therapy for this, but previous traumas and never found therapy helpful. But this just gets to me because since I am naturally attracted to women, I have this poor defense when I'm near one because I know that I probably wouldn't be strong enough to fight one off of that happened. When a man did the same, I was able to try at least, to fight it off because there was no level of attraction. Yes, I orgasmed in her and that's what breaks me. I made a vow to save sex for marriage and she forced it out of me. Maybe I shouldn't say forced, since I wasn't strong enough to stop her. If I had... anyway. It's been years since this happened and I feel more ashamed about the girl-raping-guy part than the guy on guy part.

"I suddenly understand what that whole ""being relaxed"" thing everyone always talks about is like. It's astonishing what therapy can do when done right.","After years and years of holding on to various traumas that manifested themselves in a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from excruciating nightmares and panic attacks to hallucinations and psychosomatic heartache, I finally went through an intense process of treatment. I was so skeptical before and during the process(And damn, it was hard), but suddenly, something clicked: I could look back at myself in those memories and feel sad for that girl instead of living in those memories as if they were constantly surrounding me.   
I experienced an intense release of emotion(for quite a while, bless my flatmate's hearts for dealing with me) and my body finally stopped tensing up like it constantly would.

Why did I moan during my rape? What’s wrong with me?,"Back in December the week before Christmas I was raped by a guy I had just started to get to know, who I really thought I had a chance with… We had met up in person once and then the next time he raped me. I keep trying to understand how I feel and process everything and it seems like one week I’m okay, the next I’m depressed, then angry, then shameful, so many feelings. When he raped me I was at home and i told him I didn’t want to have sex before he came over, maybe I shouldnt have let him in.. i was in my pajamas, a two piece short set.. maybe I shouldn’t have worn that and he wouldn’t have done it? We made out before it happened which led to the rape.. maybe I shouldn’t have done that? I moaned when he gave me oral it seemed like it felt good? Even now I’m questioning myself if it actually felt good or did my body just think it did? While he was penetrating me I didn’t do anything but lay there and space out and the only words I could really mumble were “I said I didn’t want to do this” and he just kept saying “don’t tell me no, I don’t like when you tell me no”… I should’ve fought harder. I’m such an advocate for victims not blaming themselves for their assault but having a really hard time giving myself that grace because maybe just maybe if I would’ve been smarter, wore a different outfit then it wouldn’t have happened. How could I even feel any arousal while something like that was happening? I even considered trying to have consensual sex with him afterwards to balance it out… if I wanted it this time then the rape wouldn’t really be a rape…right? I’m not sure what to do and it feels like I’m slowly losing my sanity. No one around me knows, I’m too guilty to say that I even felt a bit of pleasure during it. I’m losing myself it seems little by little day by day. I don’t think he even realizes he raped me, I mean he did say I was making him feel bad by the way I responded afterwards but why would he still try to keep in contact with me if he knew he raped me? Why did I answer the phone when he called even though it gave me panic attacks?? What’s wrong with me?? Was it even rape if he wasn’t rough with me?

I officially reported my abuser yesterday,"I officially reported the person who had raped me in 2017, yesterday. I had to make an appointment with a sex crime detective in my county. She asked me many, many questions and asked me what I wanted to do. She gave me two options, report him or for her to keep all the information I gave her, and if I wanted to report later than I could. 

I didn’t want to not report, but I didn’t want to report either, so I reported— if that makes sense. She told me she would be interviewing him to get his side of the story and I’m terrified of the outcome of this. He will now know that I finally told. He could lie and deny everything and if this doesn’t go to court — he could get away with it. 

She said if he tries contacting me I can file for an IPO, to keep me safe. I haven’t felt safe in a long time, and I’m hoping he confesses, but I know that’s unlikely. 

Has anyone been through the processes that’s willing to share advice? I just want to feel safe again and not feel like myself or my child is in danger anymore.

There's going to be more of us after this pandemic is over, so why not start creating a PTSD inclusive world rather than pretending we don't have a VERY valid illness? Is it really so much to ask the world to accept us as we are as long as we aren't being abusive or raging out?

Edit: Thank you for the silver! I wanted to be more clear. I was reading the comments and they were really bumming me out: "" I can't be open about my illness because..."" I had to turn off the notifications. That was never my point. 

Once upon a time, the LGBTQ+ community had to hide themselves. Their lives were in danger. People would murder them... Now it's Pride Month and there is glitter everywhere (and it's also PTSD awareness month). I'm not saying we find individual reasons to stay afraid in the closet. I'm saying we stand up and and be present and counted until the world accepts us and lets us live the way we need to live - with all our own sparkles and no excuses. 

I dream of living in a world where I don't have to pretend to be neurotypical or ""act"" normal. I want PTSD friends, and PTSD supportive businesses where I can spend my money, and a PTSD job that won't fire me for having symptoms - I want our own civil rights movement. Maybe that's too radical for some... It is a fear based disorder. But PTSD is the normal response of a healthy brain under extreme circumstances. I'm not a freak. You're not a freak. I'm a survivor and so are you. Any of the people who bully me could end up with PTSD on any day, and we will already have a community of safety to help them be better people.  (Not get better, because there is nothing wrong with us - we're amazing and we're survivors - but with these sweet soft hearts). We deserve to be protected and included.

"""My trauma is worse than yours""","These are words I hope no one ever hears or says to anyone else. It's extremely belittling and ignorant to say this to someone else. Unfortunately, these are the words I heard from my mom last night. 

Honestly, I know she went through more than I did. And I constantly tell myself that what I went through wasn't ""that bad"". But there's just some days where it really gets to me, and that's when she tells me to just ""get over it"". She wanted me to do my schoolwork, but I had a nightmare and it really messed me up for the day. But instead of offering support to me, she said, ""A nightmare? You couldn't do schoolwork for a whole day because of a nightmare? You want to talk about trauma? Mine was worse than yours.""

So that wasn't fun. My nightmares are occurring much more frequently atm because it's almost the trauma anniversary, and my mom doesn't seem to care or want to help, even though we went through one of the traumas together. It sucks.

Did anyone else experience a huge change in their personality after trauma?,"After multiple repeated traumatic events I became quiet, secluded and hardened.

I actually run away when I feel like someone wants to be friends with me now. I want to scream and ask them “WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME???” because they seem so scary and violating. 

I used to get kicked out of classrooms for laughing too much, I’d laugh so hard id fall from my chair. Yet now I can barely even laugh. All my laughs are fake forced laughs.

Do any of you feel as though you attract abusive personalities or that your PTSD makes you more prone to tolerating others that you wouldn't otherwise?,"***I am NOT saying that the victim is to blame - nobody EVER deserves abuse or anything less than the best in any relationship dynamic.

&#x200B;

I've realized that whether it be friends, romantic partners, even roommates - I tend to find myself with people whom are narcissistic & don't want to recover or take accountability for themselves, people whom take advantage of me, or whom are abusive. I know that I don't deserve or want this treatment, but I know that my PTSD often takes over, and doubts the ""red flags"" I feel other people would react to, or I allow many more boundary violations than I should. Essentially, I feel as though the ways in which my PTSD has manifested causes me to allow really abusive, manipulative, etc., people into my life whom I wouldn't otherwise give the time of day.

What the actual flying fuck? 

They changed the title from “s*xual as*sault laws in singapore” to “BDSM experience in singapore”, and removed all mention of the police case I had against the perpetrator, and all mention of me saying it was r*pe, all mention of PTSD. they framed it like a consensual non-consent scene that i agreed to.

Oh it’s just a little event but mine was my childhood. Like genuinely do you feel good as someone with ptsd saying that to someone who dealt with something traumatic? We all suffer and we all will suffer for a long time although therapy and medication can help all of us possibly reach remission.

This has made me question everything i’ve ever understood. The justice system FAILED me and so many other women who have been victimized by the predator who hurt me.

I learned to deeply hate men from men.,"I was sexually assaulted at an age where I was too young to understand the numbers 1-10, so I can never give an exact age. It was so traumatic that my mother didn't even have that talk with me. ""Don't let people touch down there"", once I remembered and understood, she had a look of pure shock in her face as a smiled and tried to laugh it off because that's how I always was.

I quickly attained a hatred for men since my father was a huge misogynist, to a point other relatives in misogynistic relationships would say he's a ""misogynistic pig!"".

Then in my teens I was drugged and r*ped with multiple men hearing me yell no, yell for help once. That's when it all clicked... Yet I was drugged and couldn't fight with my strength... I'm devastated in my life by men.

I can only name 3 abusive women and then I can generalize an entire gender out of pure survival. I had male friends who were genuine. I simply did not trust them and cut them off. That's it.

I'm done, I'm so done. Male after fucking male in my life and only one is actually semi-sympathetic and he even needs a reality check every now and then!

Anger. Devastation.

Ukraine had mass r*pe. That happened in the last year. It dates back longer than the Japanese mass r*pe, so bad that they burn and hunted down evidence.

My therapist revealed his goal was to convince me to reconcile with my abusers,"So I (26 F) finished breaking up with my therapist/had my last session yesterday.

I already had a small list of reasons that I'd written down, including him feeling the need to explain misogyny to me, his desire to treat my fear of men as my biggest issue, etc etc when I have a lot of trauma from my abusive parents that I wanted to process.

Before I got into all that though, I had some questions to help me going forward. I asked: what IS processing trauma? What does that look like? and what are the steps to take following that to relieve the betrayal I feel?

In the course of answering these questions he kept coming back to one thing: that must talk to the people who wronged me and explain myself and try and mend the relationship. I asked him then, what would be the next steps if I were talking about an abusive ex boyfriend and he STILL said the only path forward was to meet with the ex (in public because SaFeTy Is PaRaMoUnT) and talk it through with them. which I don't even know if I believe, or if he was just refusing to give me an alternate answer.

In the beginning i was VERY clear that my family was abusive and I had cut all contact with them, and that the reason I had issues with past therapists was BECAUSE they wanted me to reconcile. I thought I had been clear enough. Now it's obvious that no matter what I say, they think I can only want estrangement because I am too ill to knoe what's best. That my desire for separation is because of MENTAL ILLNESS.

I called out my abuser in his establishment’s TripAdvisor comments for what he did to me and all the girls in the group I was traveling with. I feel both empowered and very alone.,"Ten years ago I traveled abroad with a group for a “gap year” in South America. We had a weird and terrible experience when we went to a spa retreat owned by an ex-pat American man. 7 of the other girls were molested during a “spiritual healing” ceremony without anyone saying a word, they all were 18 and that’s the only reason I can think they didn’t speak up. I went last and fought the abuser and got out of there, then went to my group leader with it and as I told her about it the rest of the group chimed in saying “me too me too!” Against our wishes the group leader told the abuser the reason why we decided to leave early, and the abuser came to my room at night to try to tell me it was all innocent. I was still just a kid but I had to be the face of the group. Then our own group’s leader talked to me about it later in the trip and said it was all a misunderstanding, that things were different back in the hippy days and she was raised with that kind of thing and he didn’t mean anything by it. I went home from the trip afraid of being touched at all by my significant other and it took months for me to recover enough to just be touched. 

Flash forward to today. I watched a documentary about a man who abused foster kids, and at the end the story said the abuser had moved to a tiny island outside Guam where there was little oversight. I remembered my experience and I realized it’s possible he’s still out there doing exactly the same thing. Sure enough, his TripAdvisor is full of recent reviews - he’s definitely still in business. And as I searched I found out a woman went to his establishment and was raped by him, two months after our group’s visit. She traveled back to his country with her husband to sue him and talk to the media. Reading this really validated my experience because I had been wavering in my mind about the experience all these years. But this was a totally separate incident right at the same time we were there. 

So, I wrote about the experience in detail in their TripAdvisor comments. I explained exactly what happened in that public forum. I felt I needed to take some sort of action and I think this was an impactful thing to do. I’m worried TripAdvisor might take the comment down. I got a message back from his wife on my review and it essentially said I must be mistaken. It brings me joy to think he and his wife had to revisit this subject yet again, and that I might save someone else from going through what I did. 

It feels good to have done it but it hurts me that I can’t share it with anyone. I feel empowered but also alone.

"My girlfriend had a panic attack, we went into a quiet room, and the secretary triggered her PTSD","This took place in school. She was having an attack, and I took her down to the counselor’s, and we went into a quiet room. I closed the door to keep her more comfortable as she cried. The secretary ran, POUNDED on the door, and then SCREAMED that we could not keep the door closed. After opening it, my girlfriend began balling and shaking, the secretary could have cared less. Then, a counselor, actually the school THERAPIST walked by and said that they should send me back and that we’re co-dependent. She knew we could hear. 

I fucking hate people, and I fucking hate school. When we got there the secretary was fed up that we wanted a quiet room. She looked pissed, I could see it. Aggravated, disgusted. She doesn’t deserve her job here. My girlfriend has a crisis card for a damn reason. She comes to the counselor’s for a damn reason.

My husband shot himself right next to me.,"Me (28F) and my husband (30M) have been together since we were teenagers. We have two kids together a 4yo and a 2yo, both boys. For the most part, our relationship was great. We were each other’s first everything. First kiss, first relationship, etc. and I had noticed that this did make us extremely codependent on the other over time. Me and my husband both struggle with mental health problems. My husband more so than me. 

We got married after being together for 6 years and went right into having children. After we had our first son, things started getting really difficult. My husbands mental health began to spiral. The financial burden became fully his because couldn’t work due to health complications during my pregnancy. We had also decided that it would be more smart for us financially if I stayed home with our son, rather than getting a babysitter. 

Once our oldest became about two years old, I did go back to work to help relieve some stress and we hired my little sister to help with the kids. It helped a lot financially but my husband pretty much checked out mentally with things involving our marriage and being a parent. During the next (roughly) 3 years and one more child later, our relationship became fully platonic. This is something that deeply bothered me and I felt that we needed to fix because we both deserved better. I told my husband about how I was feeling several times and that I wanted to go to marriage counseling but he was firm on not going because he felt they would recommend separation. Which eventually lead to me asking for a separation because I had become so unhappy. 

We had been separated for a couple of weeks and the amount of peace I felt really made me realize that I wanted a divorce. So I told my husband how I was feeling. This did not go very well. He wasn’t so much angry, as just giving off a very uncomfortable vibe. I decided to take a bath and try to relax from all of the stress, and that is when I received the text. 

It was a suicide text. And he told me that if he couldn’t be with me that life was not worth living. The time stamp was two minutes earlier so I knew I needed to hurry to get to my bedroom where he had locked himself in. 

I jumped out of the bath, grabbed a towel, tried to open our bedroom door but it was locked (I didn’t realize he had locked himself is there at this point). So I ran to the kitchen, grabbed a butter knife and slide it into the door frame to unlock the door. Once I got into the room, my two year old had followed me and I didn’t know this because I was focused on helping my husband. He had locked himself in our master bathroom and I couldn’t get the door open. 

I was shaking the handle, screaming for him, asking what he was doing. He didn’t answer. I continued to shake the handle and I felt him hold it. And then I heard A loud pop and I heard his body hit the floor. Nothing but a full on wail came out of me. With my two year old right there. I immediately called 911 and grabbed my babies and my sister (she lives with us and heard this from the kitchen) and we waited on the porch, screaming and crying while the police came. 

My husband survived. He lost his right eye and most of his tongue. We do not know what exactly his quality of life will be. But I am grateful he survived. 

I’m also incredibly traumatized. My two year old screams all of the time now too. I have so many emotions it’s hard to process. I don’t understand how he could just leave me with all of this. Knowing that I would have to grieve and still parent my kids, and still have to figure out how to do all of this while overcoming all of this trauma that he put me through. 

A lot of my family doesn’t seem to understand. They think that because we had been together for so long that we need to try to work this out. But now I am terrified of him and my decision to get a divorce just feels more solidified. I want no romantic relationship with him. I have nightmares every night. I have to live in the house where my husband shot himself three feet away from me. And I feel like everyone thinks I’m this bitch who is abandoning my husband when he needs me the most. 

I just don’t know  where to begin with the healing process. I was given a few resources for counseling but I can’t bring myself to call yet. I guess I just wanted to share my story on here as a way to relieve from sort of stress.

EDIT: Wow. Thank you all so much. The amount of support I am getting from all of you is incredible. My feelings feel validated and that helps me so much more than I can even describe. I am dealing with immense guilt, anger, depression, all while trying to be a good mom to my babies and trying to survive living in this house where I’m reminded of the entire ordeal every day. I made an appointment for trauma counseling next week. Just talking to the counselor on the phone was already helpful because I felt validation. So I am hoping this is a step in the right direction. Last night was especially hard and I cried for several hours straight just dealing with all of the pain and emotions and confusion. I am going to start the process in going forward with a divorce because like many of you have stated, my instincts are telling me to run. I have nightmares every night that he is shooting himself in front of me, or running around the house with a gun trying to kill me and my boys. I have never in my life experienced trauma like this and I appreciate all of you for being so supportive and understand.

Why are people so cruel to those with trauma?,"Everyone seems to be of the opinion that talking about your trauma or seeking therapy is the healthy way to deal with your trauma. I think to some extent you can find SOME support or validation this way but people don't tell you to brace yourself for the hostility you'll receive when talking about your trauma too.

You'll lose friends when you talk about trauma. Many people are fair weather friends and will abandon you if you are struggling. Others will stigmatize ptsd. Some will be downright bullies and call you a p*ssy or a coward. Others will minimize your trauma and mock you. Yet if you try to keep the conversation light and joke about your trauma, others will get offended by you and say you're trying to be edgy or call you a troll.

It seems like so many people misunderstand where I'm coming from when I do try to talk about it and I don't understand WHY they are so mean. I don't understand why it's even advised to talk about your trauma in the first place if there's so many sick people out there that seem to like to kick people when they're low. Every now and then I'll get a mature conversation with someone on the topic, but I think it makes most people uncomfortable. Sometimes I like to analyze things and I will go over a topic ad nauseam and it doesn't bother me but it seems to enrage other people so they lash out at me and I don't know why? 

Can anyone relate? And what do you do about it? Do you just keep your trauma to yourself? Are you supposed to lie and pretend nothing bad ever happens? What is the goal even supposed to be when people encourage you to talk about your trauma with others if it only seems to upset other people?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/yjar9g/why_are_people_so_cruel_to_those_with_trauma/,PTSD

Something weird happened. It saved my life.,"I was suicidal yesterday and actually planning on using my .357 to end it. My work environment is so negative and everyone hates me so much and they make it a point to let me know so often that I had literally lost the will to live. I’ve had no one in my life for 13 years, no friends, no one. I have nothing. It was my time. 

But I went to a facility at work where I deliver to. Two nurses came up from the bottom floor and immediately asked me about my adoption tattoo. Then they immediately gave me a group hug. It was amazing. I haven’t felt physical affection in 13 years. I didn’t know what to say. I don’t even know them at all. I’ve never believed in god, but sometimes I wonder if we do have people looking out for us. It’s just such strange timing. Plus the topic was brought up in aa meeting tonight.

Does Anyone Else feel shame for not being able to work because of their trauma?,"Hello 

So I have PTSD and it can be so debilitating sometimes that I am in and out of bed all day. I dissociate daily and feel anxious constantly. I'm a full-time college student and it can be so hard to focus on the simplest assignments or even taking notes in class. I'm in therapy and taking SSRIs and Buspar for anxiety.

I come from a very ""just get over it"", ""put yourself up and move on"", ""stop being so sensitive"" sort of family. My mom essentially forced me to not accept all of my aid money for school so she could financially support me with my groceries. Other than the fact that she barely gives me enough to live off of, she also expects me to get a job.

Don't get me wrong. I really really want to work and be independent, but I feel like dealing with the symptoms of my trauma is a job in and of itself. How can I possibly work when I can hardly keep myself from dissociating and I can have a flashback at any moment? I feel so much shame because I feel like I should be able to work just like everyone else and function just like anyone else.

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you cope with this and stop feeling so much shame for how your brain responds to trauma? Thank you for reading <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/jtrk4t/does_anyone_else_feel_shame_for_not_being_able_to/,PTSD

"Does anyone else get dreams that isn't about their traumatic event, but have themes of it?","TW sexual abuse/ assault description 

If anyone wants more info into what happened to me, you can check my profile.

I've had quite weird and scary dreams these past two nights. The first one was where I was alone with a man in a car, he resembled my abuser body shape wise. I was in a parking lot and the man was in the front seat and I in the back. He got out and walked to where I was, I immediately began to panic even though he didn't enter the car. I was thinking that something bad will happen, he entered the car and I scooted away from him, the dream gets blurry from here but I vividly remember that feeling of extreme fear and helplessness while he was hugging me or having his arm around my waist. (I'm scared of hugs because of what happened to me, I guess that might be connected but I don't know) I was just feeling so so terrified, and I felt that exact same blood curdling fear when the traumatic event was happening. I felt completely frozen both in the dream and the original event. 

Then I was outside a police station and that's where it ended. (I never reported) 

The second one is a lot more obscure and confusing, it was like any ordinary weird dream, I was driving somewhere, it felt as if I was in a video game, but then I was again at a police station. I was inside of the building and then I hear a 17 year old girl scream, 'get off me, get the fuck off me. I'm 17. Stop it, stop it.'

I began to feel fearful and I froze again, but I got the courage to turn the corner and I caught a small glimps of an older man cuddling this girl, I'm assuming it was tight since she couldn't get away. She started to scream something about her boyfriend but her voice didn't sound like it was a little whimper, it was screams of anger, frustration and being fed up. But the man wouldn't let her go.

Then a woman police officer was way too calmly walking down the hallway this was happening, it looked like she won't do anything about the situation because of the way she walked but I woke up straight after seeing that officer so I don't know if she would've done something or not. 

I'm just in a weird place right now. I've been having dreams of sexual assaults/ abuse, even rape (I was never raped) ever since the traumatic event happened. I never had dreams like that before, never. 

Can anyone relate to my situation and is this normal?? I feel so ashamed that I'm having such fucked up dreams even though I was never raped, or touched anywhere private without my consent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/jbwb4b/does_anyone_else_get_dreams_that_isnt_about_their/,PTSD

I wish more people spoke about the trauma of being poor,"Roughly two years ago, I was homeless. I’m housed now thanks to subsidized housing but still struggling greatly. 

Ptsd puts our mind and body into survival mode, but that’s extended so much when basic things like food aren’t a guarantee. 

I’ve talked about it with my therapist. Went over the hierarchy of needs and how often when our most basic needs aren’t met, we struggle to do anything. 

Doing tasks that aren’t basic needs for survival become more difficult. It makes sense really. Our survival instinct is we need food to survive. Why would we care about anything else? 

It’s stressful. It’s draining. I sit and worry about if we will have food in the fridge in the next few days. I worry if I’ll lose the roof over my head again one day. All I do is worry about it. 

It’s also draining because often the body isn’t getting what it needs to function. If you rely on the food bank to feed yourself your meals aren’t what you need them to be. Things like milk, eggs, meat, fresh veggies and fruits often aren’t available. You don’t get enough to make GENUINE home cooked meals.

I found my mother's dead body,"I don't usually make posts like this, and I've never used Reddit before, but I just need to get it out. I've never told anyone this before, never allowed myself to really think about it either.

Almost a year ago, my mother died of alcohol poisoning. She had it coming, surprise it didn't happen earlier. I came home from school to find her laying on the couch. Not unusual, I didn't think much of it and went on with my day, thinking she had just fallen asleep there like countless of other times. 

A few hours later when I came out of my room, she was still laying there. I started to worry a bit, but knew it was probably nothing. Came closer (bad idea usually), started looking for signs of life. Nothing. No breathing. No pulse. Wouldn't move when I probed her.

Started to panic real hard, I can't tell you what I was going through at that moment as I was just a mess of ""Ohmygod she's dead she's dead."" I called my sister and she immediately came home. Honestly the next few hours were a blur. My dear sister took care of everything, I was barely there.

Afterwards, I told everyone I was fine. My sister, the social workers, my teachers. But even now, a year later, I can't get over how traumatizing that was. Everytime I come home from school, I get that image in my head of her on the couch. I have to stop myself from throwing up when I even smell alcohol. It haunts my dreams and everyday life.

I feel ashamed for having PTSD when other people have much more traumatic and understandable causes than mine,"I know veterans aren’t the only ones who have PTSD, and I know there are plenty of veterans who probably also feel weak or ashamed or embarrassed for having PTSD. I’m not a veteran, and I can’t stop feeling like my reason for having PTSD isn’t good enough or isn’t as bad as other people’s, especially veterans’. 

I went through almost a year in a relationship filled with emotional and sexual abuse, and now almost half a year of the reporting process with my college that has honestly ended in disaster, with the conduct board blaming me instead of my abuser. I know what I went through was traumatic, I know that PTSD is what I’m struggling with now, but I feel so weak and ashamed for it. I don’t mean for this to seem insensitive to anyone, but for some reason I can’t stop thinking that at least veterans with PTSD (or others who got PTSD from service to others or their country) got it while doing something brave and noble, while I got it from just letting another person have power over me and letting that person make me afraid. 

If I had just been more assertive, maybe he would have stopped. I could have just left — I know now all of his implied threats were empty anyways — he never would have hurt himself, he was just saying that. 

I only let this happen to protect myself. I have no noble reason for it. I was selfish and dumb and naive, and it really is my fault for letting this happen. There are plenty of people, like veterans and firefighters and EMTs and police officers and doctors and nurses who have PTSD as a result of serving their country and their community, not from being too weak to stand up for themselves like I was. 

On the one hand, I really believe this, that it’s my fault, that I should have said something, and that other people who have PTSD are so much more worthy of support and admiration because they’ve been through so much more difficult things for better, more noble reasons than me. But on the other hand, I rationally know that that’s not how this works, or at least I hope it’s not. 

If anyone has any advice or just a response in general, I would really appreciate it.

Technique for intrusive memories,"I come from Scandinavia. We fish a lot, in wooden boats on the fjords. And the sea is so vast, deep, blue and endless. If we catch a fish you cannot eat, we unhook it and toss it back into the sea. Where it swims away, into the deep.

My boyfriend nearly died and I can't stop hearing the sound.,"Earlier today we were out with some friends, chilling and relaxing as one does. We started to mess around with a ball and a bat and eventually I hear this sickening whack and a moan, I look over and my boyfriend is falling over with a bat stuck to his forehead. I launch into a run and my friend and I drag him inside, same friend that hit him, and I call an ambulance. Skip ahead a bit and the last thing I see of him is him shivering with blood all over his face, in his hair, on the ground, just everywhere and It stains my eyelids. He gets dragged into an ambulance and I can't see him anymore, just the frantic shaking as they work inside. I looked down at my hands and one of them was also coated in blood. And I just couldn't. It is  hours later and I have been uncontrollably sobbing for at least an hour and a half. I don't know why I feel the need to share this story but thank you for reading. I am not really looking for support as I know this feeling will probably fade once he recovers. The doctors said his brain scan was fine and he had no broken or fractured bones so that's something. More than anything I am just immeasurably grateful to still have him in my life and this experience has strengthened my love for him 20 times but that deep dreadful feeling when watching someone you love possibly die, it is haunting and that sound will forever be burned into my mind. Again, thank you for taking the time to read this nightmare.

Update: after a few hours of uncontrollable sobbing I eventually passed out while watching over him without even realizing. Thank you for your ideas to help me calm myself. His wound doesn't seem to be any worse after sleeping so I think the healing process is going to be good.

Update 2: Things are looking good, after a lot of talking and being there for each other he is forming thoughts and holding focus better now, he was able to sleep off and on but couldn't fully rest. I am also much better now, the recommendation to play Tetris really helped me calm down and I will be forever thankful my eyes were opened to that.

Back story: My sister and I had experienced a lot of trauma already. We were in separate homes. Our parents were dead, and we’d survived 2 murders. I was in a verbally and emotionally abusive home. All this led me to feeling worthless and unlovable. 

That’s why he targeted me. 

Over the course of several months, he stopped to talk to me. Got my number. Started calling and slowly built rapport- I now understand this was grooming. After I turned 14, the calling escalated and he drove over to my house to offer yard work. The male figure of my home had recently died so it was just me and the woman raising me. He flattered her. She was old fashioned and thought nothing of a grown man wanting a young girl. 

Once he got approval, the love bombing started. Before long, the sex. I didn’t even know what to do or how to do it. In short order, his charm eroded. He began controlling me and calling me ugly and worthless. 

By now, I think this is “love”. He told me it was love. 

My mental health deteriorated and I ended up suicide attempt with a 2 week hospital stay. I also had a venereal disease that had spread very far requiring iv treatment. 

I got out and the sexual and emotional abuse resumed and one of his friends was after my young friend to boot! 
He never took me on a date. Never showed me any gentleness or tender touch.  He brought one of his friends over to meet me. That friend had some sense and told him what he was doing to me was rape. 

He disappeared abruptly. Tried to come back off and on a few times. I told him off. He did the same thing to five other victims of similar age that I know of!

Over the years, my view of love and relationships was warped by what he did to me. I’ve had other traumas since, but trauma has layers like an onion. This is my core wound regarding men. It took me until I was 40 to realize it!

I made a fake Facebook account and I sent his ass a long winded message about how he victimized me and the state it happened in has no statute of limitations on rape of someone the age I was. 

I still have photos of him and I, not nude, but sexual enough that I believe I could finally report him and possibly get justice. 
It felt good to tell him off. To get my power back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/p6i5dq/its_been_27_years_since_i_was_raped_by_a_20_year/,PTSD
"Has PTSD made me ""stupid""?","Hi guys,

I used to be someone who was in tune and quite sharp and had amazing memory and was a good thinker. 

I have noticed since I witnessed many traumatic events that I am not myself and seem to act ""stupid"" and ditzy.  I do Biosciences in a Level 5 HND and I can do it but I just can't seem to grasp the information like I used to and people think I am stupid (and have told me to my face).  Can this happen from traumatic events?  If so, any tips or advice? 

Many thanks

I grieve the person i was before,"i look at old pictures and videos of me and it breaks my heart. I was so full of life even my eyes looked like they had sparkle in them. I was so loud and confident and wasn’t scared of anything or anyone for that matter. I walked with a purpose and a sense of happiness every single day. I loved waking up in the morning and I loved going to sleep knowing the next day I would be able to enjoy life again. I was artistic and loved photography it was my passion and pure bliss to me. I was very social and enjoyed traveling and going out. I always felt things with such deep emotion wether it was good or bad and I truly feel like that is why I used to enjoy life so much. My siblings loved being around me and I enjoyed their company just as much. Are favorite thing was to go to the beach and get pizza afterward. I would find the beauty in the tiniest things that normally people would pay attention to. I would laugh at everything especially with my friends. They were the best friends you could ever ask for and I miss them dearly. I miss always being known as the “hard working” person in my friend group. I miss sitting outside in the middle of the night on the porch with my dog feeling the breeze and having this content feeling within myself knowing that whatever happens in the future that I would get through it. 

My trauma has taken that ability to feel at peace in my soul and heart. 

I hope one day my siblings won’t look at me in such confusion as to why I am not the same anymore. I hope one day I will be able to finish an oil painting without dissociating for long periods of time and not being able to concentrate. I hope one day I am able to hang out with people without freaking out internally because they want to give me a hug. I hope one day I can sit on the porch again and feel that internal peace I once felt before.

The conversation around “victim mentality” and “victim mindset” is super fucked up and holds no nuance,"It’s as if people spurn the idea of being a victim. I fully understand people back this belief and dialogue because they feel it empowers others to take control of their circumstances, and in a lot of cases it can do just that. But I see true victims tormented or silenced with this rhetoric that allows for no grace with genuine victimization…there IS no power when you are victimized. You can gain it back for yourself after the fact and with time, but acknowledging being victimized is so critical for development and healing. I often see people who espouse this as victims themselves that were denied this or deny themselves this and become somewhat destructive and apathetic towards others and themselves. “I was beaten as a child and I’m okay.” “I faced racism and I didn’t let it affect me.” “I was assaulted and I didn’t give in to victim mentality.” Okay. That’s great? When you say it the 1000th time to every person you see that’s willing to face the fact their trauma changed them, I wonder who’s having the harder time taking control…them or you.

I see too many abusers and unhealed people using this line.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/148za6e/the_conversation_around_victim_mentality_and/,PTSD
Why no accountability?? Why are we expected to just “move on??”,"If you have PTSD because of someone/people/an entity that involves a person, they should be held accountable and should have to face consequences but even in therapy I’m always redirected back to myself and “moving on,” and it’s like sorry I can’t just magically do that while I’m having nightmares about someone every night and they’re prospering while I can’t even function. Everyone talks about “being responsible for your own happiness “ and if you’re traumatized then go fix that, like as if it’s your fault, yet there’s no emphasis on accountability and having the responsible parties pay consequences. I guess I don’t agree with that. I guess it’s MY problem that I’m traumatized.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/oafib6/why_no_accountability_why_are_we_expected_to_just/,PTSD

I got rejected for my car accident PTSD everything was going great until I told him 😭,So I was diagnosed with PTSD after getting rear ended by a drunk driver . Rear ended so hard It pushed me into the first lane of the highway . I had to get out of my car while it was moving so I wouldn’t get hit by the traffic that was about to come & I saw my car literally crash into the ditch across the highway it was terrifying and has haunted me since I was 21. Now at 29 with a different car I still have panic attacks with driving and can barely make it past 5 minutes of driving without being in crippling panic or having a flashback of my wreck or the other times I had panic attacks. So I went out on a date the other day with a man in his late 40s. And he picked me up the date was going well because he was saying how pretty I was and how amazing I was at conversation then he starts talking about the therapy he’s in for his mental health issues. Then I started telling him about my EMDR therapy for my car accident and he looked at me like I was an alien. And he even asked for the check and then once we back to his car he started saying “ you expect me to drive 40 mins all the time to see you for your fears” . I started crying and saying “ you don’t understand how crippling this is for my daily life I hate too”. Then without any emotion he flat out said “ he wanted a partnership not another job “ and took me home. I blocked his number and cried my eyes out. Why are other PTSD havers more acceptable especially veterans but not people who went through terrifying car accidents?  So I don’t deserve love because my panic attacks & PTSD cripple me from driving 😩,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1aunqd5/i_got_rejected_for_my_car_accident_ptsd/,PTSD
Just dropping in to remind you that PTSD does not make you weak,"In case you needed to hear it today, you are not weak because you have PTSD. PTSD is a biochemical response, and studies have shown that that response is (partially) genetically programmed. Your body's reaction to trauma is not a reflection of your mental strength. Be kind to yourself.

Here's an example of a study linking genetics and biochemistry (specifically of vitamin D) to the development of PTSD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ItsAllInYourGenes/comments/ldnbne/posttraumatic\_stress\_disorder\_is\_associated\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItsAllInYourGenes/comments/ldnbne/posttraumatic_stress_disorder_is_associated_with/)

"""You're more than your past""","Oh how I hate that phrase. If one more person tells me that I'm ""more than my past"" I'm going to rip my head off. As PTSD is me just fixating on my past rather than a disorder that doesn't allow me to forget. My entire life has been dedicated to trying to forget. From eating disorders to self harm I've literally spent my whole life trying to keep my trauma out of my head. It's not a fixation, it's a disorder. Like depression or anxiety or any other. Anxiety isn't you fixating on panic. Depression isn't you fixating on sadness. I understand it's meant with good intentions but I take it as an insult. If I could take a pill to forget, I'd take it many times over.

ALL medical professionals should be required extensive training on PTSD,"Just a rant. Its long.

Malware is software written specifically to harm and infect the host system. PTSD is the malware infecting my system and FEAR is the virus that wrecks havoc.

So I have been triggered and my symptoms take over my entire being.
I have 3 options

Flee
Freeze 
Or Fight 

These are the ONLY options fear will give me, suddenly a harmless and simple situation  has turned into a battle for my survival. And yes, to me, its as dire as it sounds. So my logic and reason programming has been overridden -its not gone, its still running, but its only running at minimum so the virus can feed off the program and piggy back on the signal to proceed with the virus’ own programming.

So I am faced with the three options mentioned above. What do they look like?

Flee- Literally leave the situation in any way I can. Seeing as the logic and reason programming is still running albeit at a limitation, I can process enough information from my environment to look for an immediate exit and follow through with fleeing from the situation. Analyzing my environment for an exit is about the only way I can use the logic and reason program that is still running. And this is an immediate reaction, either i phsically leave my environment ASAP or make arrangements and overcoming necessary hurdles to leave. The way I flee is dependant on the trigger that accessed the survival instinct. And the severity of my reaction to flee is also dependant on said specific trigger. No matter what I'm doing or what's going on, when I'm triggered it's time to flee.


Fight- So my fear of my survival has been activated (essentially, my logic and reason program has been infected with the malicious code FEAR) and my logic and reason programming is running at a minimum. I’ve already scanned and processed the option to leave but I have come to the conclusion that fleeing is not an option. Meaning my exits in my environment are blocked or there are people who are blocking my exits. For my reaction to be extreme enough to want to fight, the people blocking my only exits must be some type of authority. For example, police officers, EMTs, or any type of medical professionals. My understanding is  that these people are the only people who can act on their authority at will with or without good intent. In civil society, these people are considered as necessary and these people are supposed to hold good intent. I am recounting VIVIDLY how each and everyone of these so called “authority with good intent” VIOLATED me. Physically and psychologically. Seeing as I don't want to relive said horrible experiences again I consider theses authorities as ENEMIES to my survival whenever I see them when my survival instinct has been severely triggered. I will FIGHT these authorities. I will flail and scream and cry and do whatever makes them feel uncomfortable by being naked or screeching and howling when they touch me.  And it seems like, in my experience, these authorities do not have the faculties or understanding to not not treat me like an animal. I mean in all of my recounted experiences of cops, EMTs and nurses they exacerbated my symptoms by physically hurting me and demeaning me. Remember my logic and reason program is still running in the background so i’m still aware of what’s being said to me, how they are touching me, how they handle me and what emotions they evoke when they demean me. Plus im cogiscent enough to realize, causing injury to said authorities is a metaphorical DEATH SENTENCE. I don't want to go to jail or be arrested, or treated like a dangerous and malicious mentally ill person, so I am cognizant enough not to cause injury to others- I'm just SCARED and I CRY. Do these professionals really think I’m a danger to them when I’m naked and  bawling and screeching about being raped and that I don't want to be touched without care? Don’t I have a right to say “don't touch me” during perineal care yet said medical professionals disregard my repeated requests? Rendering me even more panicked about being in the ER? They think im insane. Well THEY are the ones who are insane with reasoning that extreme measures of restraint, ridicule and deliberate touching of my clitoris is the only way to treat a frightened, crying, naked young woman. Who let these people be medical professionals? And they get to live their lives thinking they did nothing wrong while I SUFFER .I’m reliving these memories to the point of not functioning due to the extreme anxiety that these memories induce. I have PTSD from my experience at the ER. PTSD that is being treated with the help of my primary doctor. Who btw, I can barely see because he triggers such horrible feelings and memories. 

Medical professionals are suppose to be a beacon of hope, but instead they are psychological abusers. When it comes to psychological trauma, it's like all their training goes out the window and I'm just some animal. These medical professionals should not be  allowed to wantonly explain away their cruelty and the robbing of my humanity with a phrase of “that just my job.” yet I have no name of the woman who touched my clitoris deliberately while providing perineal care. I don't even recall if she was an RN or CNA. But the restraints? Those were uncalled for and I’m going to have to live with that trauma for the rest of my life. 

Freeze: knowing I cant fight or flee my body and brain just shuts down. I'm immobile, incapable of normal interaction. I'm still cognizant of what's around me but I'm being forced to watch the memories like some sick psycho is tying my down to a chair and forcing horrible movies about my life. I'm shivering, holding back tears gripping whatever is in my hand with dear life. Just visible distressed and immobile.

Every single one of these reactions are EMBARRASSING and SHAMEFUL in polite society. I'm no longer worthy to exist because people just dont understand what trauma does to a person.

EDIT: I didn't expect my post would get as much traction as it did! Thank you for your stories! I feel kinda weird for being grateful to share this specific type of trauma with others, yet before the PTSD sub-reddit I felt so alone and so ashamed. I wish you all safe travels on the path to healing!

P.S Any medical professionals who just have the need to ""educate"" me or anyone else on proper EMS procedure with the intention to exonerate EMS personel...well I cant stop you...but just know your unsolicited advice will fall on deaf ears.

P.S.S I'm coming off as angry and maybe a little harsh in my writing tone because...I'm angry 🤷‍♀️ I'm not neccesarily proud of sounding so angry but  I think I have the right to do so in order to express the trauma I received. I believe it's part of my personal healing process.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/emapgp/all_medical_professionals_should_be_required/,PTSD
I need to talk about my son.,"NSFW- Child loss & Domestic Violence




When I was 15 I was in a horrible relationship. We're talking daily violence and essentially 4 years of torture both physical and mental. He was 3 years older than me, he was twice my size and I was completely powerless. 

By the time I was 17 I was completely isolated from everyone I love and utterly reliant on him and when I fell pregnant it was just another excuse for him to control every little thing about my life. He had expressed early on that he had no interest in the baby and did not want to be a father. I missed the majority of my prenatal appointments and had to lie to get to any of them, which was an incredibly risky business. 

A few times I took beatings and was convinced I'd lose my baby because they were always focused around my stomach. But my little one held on and was the only thing getting me through it all. I of course wanted to leave but I had nothing and no one, my family and friends had no idea I was even pregnant. 

When I was 37.5 weeks pregnant he drove me towards his work- his work bordered a massive wooded area/conservation park- and when we got to the most secluded part he pushed me out of the car and kicked and kicked and kicked. Every blow landed on my stomach, I tried to protect my baby, not caring how much he hurt me, but eventually I was in a state of semi consciousness and I couldn't control my body anymore. I cannot describe the pain. Like someone had ripped every single one of my organs out one by one, covered them in acid and put them back in. He walked away from me, got back in the car and drove off. That picture of the car driving away, of laying in the road in more pain than I've ever felt is what haunts my nightmares and flashes in front of my eyes every single day. 

I don't remember much after that. An older couple, in their 60s I think found me and took me to the hospital- I'm told they had no phone signal to call for an ambulance. The next thing I remember is waking up, feeling empty. I knew my baby wasn't there anymore but I had no idea where they were. I was frantic, asking where my baby was, if they were alive. I was so upset I'd pulled out all of my IVs and was trying to get out of bed. A doctor came in and told me that my placenta had ruptured, my baby was alive, but he'd been without oxygen for such a long time they didn't expect him to live through the night. 

I was 17 years old, alone having just had major surgery and now been told my child would likely die. The only thing getting me through and he'd be gone too. They brought him in, this tiny little thing covered in wires and tubes. I'd barely even acknowledged the doctor when he told me that my baby was a little boy. None of it was how it was meant to be, but he was here and he was mine and I promised myself I'd do everything possible to help him and protect him.

Alfie wasn't even on my shortlist of names but when the nurse asked me if I had a name for him, it's what came out without hesitation, it felt right. That nurse sat with me for hours, even after her shift ended so I wasn't alone. We are still friends to this day. I was allowed to hold him with the help of some pillows so I didn't rip my stitches and he wrapped his tiny hand around my finger. The doctor came back regularly to check on him and it was clear even to me that he was deteriorating. I asked them to stop my pain medication so I could remember him more clearly, so I wouldn't forget a single second. They were reluctant but agreed and I held my son for 44 hours and 13 minutes until he took his final breath. 

I'm sure I was screaming, but all I could hear was my ears ringing and I just held him and cried for hours, until they told me they had to take him away. I've never known emptiness like it. My arms were empty, my heart was empty and my stomach was empty. It still feels like someone reached their first into my chest and ripped out my heart, even 8 years later. 

Most of my family and friends still don't even know about Alfie. I can't talk about him out loud. I can't answer their questions and watch their hearts break as well as my own. My amazing best friend knows as does my SO and they're both incredible when the world gets too much. 

Alfie's father is in prison, for the things he did to me and subsequently his now ex-wife and going to court was the hardest thing I've ever done. But I did it for my son, to get him justice, even though it will never bring him back to me. 

If you're still reading, thank you. I'm glad you met Alfie with me. He was born at 11:11 in the morning. So if you happen to catch it on the clock, make a wish on us both.

I reported my rapist and I’m giving my statement to the police tomorrow,"UPDATE: 
I went to the station, I was there doy about two hours. The detective was thorough but I was expecting it. I cried lots. The whole thing was recorded, in case they use it in court. 
I feel kinda numb. Telling all those deets was a lot harder than I thought. Charges would be sexual assault and attempt to rape. Only attempt because he didn’t penetrate me - he wasn’t hard enough… and finger penetration doesn’t count as rape. Oh well. The detective said that I did brilliantly and they were extremely helpful and caring. 

I’d like to thank EVERYONE who took a second to say something. You’re the real MVPS. We need one another. If you ever need/want to talk drop me a message 💕

Hello everyone, I’m 33F a long time lurker, this is my first time posting. 

I was raped in 2017 and I was diagnosed with PTSD in March. Hard to tell how long it’s been going on - this past few years have been extremely hard on my mental health. 

I decided on my own accord to report my rapist to the police after a lot of therapy and pondering. I’m going to the station tomorrow. I was fine, happy, motivated. Now I’m a freaking mess. 

I will go, that’s out the question. I guess I just want some support from someone. I’m very scared. I feel tiny and ridiculous. 

He was my boss. We both had partners and I said no, several times. He said he couldn’t remember anything - it was during a night out. 2 months later, he opened an investigation to get me fired, but it didn’t go anywhere and not long after I left. 

I’m looking for kind words. I’m scared and scarred. I’d like to know I’m not alone. Thank you 💜",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/qe4xzq/i_reported_my_rapist_and_im_giving_my_statement/,PTSD
having to grow up too fast due to trauma damaged me,"i used to love when people told me i acted mature for my age. i was always seen as a kid with lots of potencial and very intelligent. this was all due to having to ""grow up"" too fast because of being traumatized since i was 3 years old and developing anxiety disorders. i was a child worried about life and existence, and very very scared. i had toys but i wasn't the typical child who always wanted to have more and more toys, simply because that didn't matter that much. all i wanted was to feel normal.
since i always felt like i had to act older than i was, now that im 18, i feel like crying because i didn't actually get anything from being very ""mature"" for my age. it's all loneliness and regret for wasting my potential, because even tho i really was creative and smart i never had the energy to actually use that potential because i was just so damaged. i just lost my childhood and now at 18 with all this isolation from covid i am starting to realize that i want to be a happy child for just one day. i want to be taken care of and loved instead of yelled at. i don't want to have panic attacks or phobias, or responsibilities etc. i simply want to be a happy kid with no fears just for one day. i want to know what that is like. i hate being a grown up. i feel like that's all I've ever been and I'm exhausted.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/k4ztum/having_to_grow_up_too_fast_due_to_trauma_damaged/,PTSD

People telling me “Your trauma doesn’t define you” really bothers me,"My trauma literally goes back farther than my earliest memories and I have trauma from both my parents, my sibling, my extended family, school, church, from “friends” and from my workplaces. It sounds impossible, I know, I still think I’m over reacting most of the time that my life must have been normal - but each person I tell about my life assures me it was not 🙃

I’m not so arrogant as to think I’m anything more than a product of my circumstance, just like everyone else. I was given no coping skills and had my self esteem and psyche constantly worn down from the moment I left the womb and on. Im currently disabled because of my trauma, couldn’t graduate post-secondary because of my trauma, I picked my job based on issues I still face deriving from my trauma. 

It feels like people who tell me my trauma doesn’t define me are telling me to stop being so affected by a lifetime of struggle and to just invent a new self and self-history. It’s condescending and invalidating and feels like they’re rubbing it in my face that they were lucky enough to actually develop a sense of self before it was shattered.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/13047xz/people_telling_me_your_trauma_doesnt_define_you/,PTSD
Being regularly low-key disrespected for being unemployed due to ptsd and covid is destroying me. I feel weak for even complaining about it.,"Anytime I say I'm having a hard time, my friends tell me that they're pulling double and triple shifts while I ""sit around."" They can't see how I could possibly be hurting when I don't work right now. Some pople have stopped respecting me, even suggesting that my struggles with ptsd as an excuse for laziness. 

It seems like either people see me as a disabled loser, or a lazy layabout. People treat me like I'm entitled for not wanting to be pushed to my breaking point at a job. I know I can't possible do what it takes to be employed in this economy right now, and even 40 hours was too much before; it was barely sustainable for me.

Maybe that means I'm weak and disabled, I don't know. It's making me start to doubt myself and feel really insecure, like a parasite on society. 
I feel like a loser, a failure, and a broken person when people talk to me as if I'm an inferior or weak for being unemployed.

It's rare that anyone comes right out and says it, although it does happen, but mostly the tension is under the surface; I feel it often.

I finally understood why I prefer to stay up at night.,"Its not just insomnia, it's not sleep apnea, just nightmares or the silence.

I stay up at night because I'm hypervigilant all the time, and being alone awake at night triggers my alertness so much I'm unable to sleep without medication.

Of course, when I eventually end up sleeping its out of exhaustion more than anything, but it's better than the dreadful feeling of going to sleep without knowing who or what could end up waking me.

I was terrorised by a babysitter as a kid, and I lived in rough neighborhoods for four years. Those factors, plus my other child abuse and depression is what I think truly triggers this now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/ibbbz1/i_finally_understood_why_i_prefer_to_stay_up_at/,PTSD
"Brainspotting therapy - OMG, try it!","(3 Month Update Below, outlining how I feel now, why EMDR didnt work for me before and why EMDR works for me now)

I am writing this the night of my first mind blowing experience with this therapy. 

4 years of talk therapy for me did nothing. (Results may vary for each person. It may work for you, it just didn’t for me). 

So I looked into EMDR, because it was hailed as the best for PTSD and especially after reading “The Body Keeps the Score.” 

But 8 or 9 sessions in and I just wasn’t getting it. Feeling it. Just… nothing. 

I was about to quit yet another form of therapy. 

Then, my EMDR therapist said “hey, I just got certified in something called brain spotting. Wanna give it a go?” 

“Sure.  What is it?” 

She then held up a stick with a little ball on the end, looked like a magic wand. 

(This was Telehealth by the way.)

“I’m going to to move this very slowly down the screen while you think about the traumatic event we’ve been working on. When you feel something, tell me when to stop.” 

“Something?” I said. “Like what?” 

“You’ll know when you feel it,” she said.  

“This is total woo woo new-age bullshit I am about to waste my hard earned money on…” I thought. “But, to hell with it. Got nothing to lose.” 

“Just keep your head still and follow with your eyes,” she calmly said. 

She then proceeded to move the wand down the screen. Very slowly. 

Nothing. 

Nothing. 

Okay a little something. 

Okay there is pressure in my head. 

Wow, this is getting intense. 

My face red, and tears forming in my eyes I struggled to finally say “right there.” 

I felt it coming to the surface. 

She did the same horizontally across the screen. 

Nothing, nothing, then BAM! A new spot. 

After a couple other movements across the screen that yielded nothing, she asked which of the two previous spots felt stronger. 

I chose the one, where the little ball rested just below her chin.  

For the next 40 minutes, in total complete silence, she held the wand in that position and I just stared at it. 

It was an emotional explosion!  I cried like I never had in therapy before. The event would come to the forefront of my mind and I could literally feel it “working it’s way forward and out!” 

I cried so much staring at that ball that snot was pouring out my nose as i deep weeped. 

My mind started with what I felt was my top trauma, then it suddenly shifted to my brothers death - which was 5 years ago and I felt I had handled it well at the time, all things considered. 

But my brain was now telling me that I hadn’t processed it yet. 

And now it was time to do that. 

Suddenly, I balled like a child. My subconscious showed me that I had blamed  myself partly for his passing - because I wasn’t there to help him. 

I went from surprise, to sadness, to anger, then … self forgiveness. 

Actual, real, self forgiveness. 

There really wasn’t anything I could have done to prevent it. And suddenly, I embodied that feeling deeply. 

My emotions oscillated on extremes for the entire 40 minutes. My mind was … FIXING THE BURIED! 

And all I did WAS STARE AT A BALL ON THE END OF A STICK! 

What??????

More was done in silence in 40 minutes than 4 years of talking. 

And I could just simply FEEL it working. 

I can’t explain it, but I was just more clear in my head afterwards. Lighter.  

My therapist gently smiled and said “I think we found the modality that works for you.” 

I cried even more when she said that. 

Because I knew she was right. I felt like I had reached my therapy “home,” at last. 

It was brutal and hard- and thats how i knew it was where my healing journey was about to finally begin. 

I booked her for weekly visits for two months out, wiped the snot from my nose, cancelled my appointments for the rest of the day and went for a walk in the sun - my mind clear and face grinning for the first time in ages. :)


07/24/22 UPDATE:

Hey all! Sorry for the delay. Going through a move to a new city but wanted to update you guys on my progress.

I have to say, I’ve felt … different. Better, different.

Sessions 1-4, were intense, non stop crying for long bouts. 5-7 was about 1/2 crying and “trauma work out.” And last session was … no crying.

I was shocked.

So shocked that i said “okay, let’s try EMDR.”

That’s when I found out what I was doing “wrong” with EMDR before and why it wasn’t working.

She moved her wand across the screen at a steady back and forth pace for up to 10 minutes. Somewhere along minute 6 or 7 I could feel the trauma coming forward, same as brain spotting (though not as intense now given my precious brain spotting sessions). 

It turns out, EMDR didn’t work before because the therapists would only have me following the light or finger (or pulse pads) for at most 30 seconds. It never felt like enough time to dig deep.

And this therapist showed me that different brains need different amounts of time to process the movement.

So now we have shifted to EMDR for a couple sessions to see what we can “work out” still. I won’t stop until 30 minutes of spotting or EMDR produces nothing.  And I feel oh so close! Perhaps only a month or so away.

Before, I was having numerous bouts of autistic levels of “stimmings,” extreme agoraphobia where I couldn’t leave my bed for fear of, well, everything, and my brain was so pressurized with trauma, I could cry at moment on any day, and this was almost every day since the incident that catalyzed all these feelings. (I was incarcerated in another country for a crime I didn’t commit, and was treated quite horribly as a result, placed in solitary confinement with no books or outside world contact, only to be proven innocent months later, once all the damage was done). 

I still have anxieties, and pace the room sometimes, but it’s about 80% less than it used to be.

So I would call that a HUGE win.

I would be happy to share my therapist’s info if you are based in NV.  You can DM me. I know how hard it can be to find a good one. But honestly, while she is amazing, this therapy kind of can be done by any trauma trained therapist, just ask them to do it longer. If the therapist gets physically tired of moving their finger back and forth, ask for the pulse pads or that they use a wand with a ball on it and to place it propped against the edge of the desk so they can swivel it, keeping its motion consistent and not wearing out the therapist’s arm.

I feel light bars might be best here, at least for me.

I hope this update inspires some of you who didn’t “feel” EMDR working or wanted another option.

It does work.

It sounds so new agey. Or bogus.

But man, after years of talk therapy, this is the only thing that made me function again.

I hope all of you find the emotional comfort you you deserve.

You are worth it.

You can get better.

The chains can be broken.

Tracked down a man who took advantage of me at like 12yrs old,"So when I was like 12 on a game called ourWorld I received a gift from someone. He started talking to me, turns out he's this guy older than my mom. But he was friendly and he gifted me like a month of their premium pass, so I kept talking to him. Eventually we move over to Kik, where the conversation got sexual. He sent me naked photos and videos of himself and coerced me into sending some back. I think he even video called me once. He's married BTW.

Well today I remembered that and gave him a Google, I only remembered his Kik username and [other identifying information]. I was able to find his full name, address, phone number, and email.

So I signed him up for every form of scientology mailing list you can be on. Even signed him up for an in person consult tomorrow, so he'll get a call when he doesn't show.

It's scientology. They will NEVER leave him alone. I won't ever see the fallout of this, but I'm pleased.

Recent trauma due to wife's child birth ,"TW >!post partum psychosis!<

Hi all. Looking for some advice. My wife gave birth to our first child (a healthy and beautiful baby boy) and then unfortunately suffered a massive psychotic episode that has since been diagnosed as post partum psychosis. I was there by her side for almost the entire thing. The delusions, paranoia, chaotic thoughts along with the manic levels of energy were brutal to watch. And I honestly thought it couldn't get worse until she grabbed my shirt so tight I could barely breath and ended up biting my chin so hard I thought at the time I was losing my face. Thankfully we were at the hospital still when this happened and they were able to get us separated before any significant physical damage was done. 

It was 12 hours long and the bite was three seconds although it feels much longer. Currently I'm at home with a five day old baby, a dog, and a wife who will hopefully be transferred to a psych hospital tomorrow or Monday. This happened two days ago and I have no clue how to move forward except feed my baby and keep him clean. Has anyone else experienced something similar or know of any resources? I am talking to therapists next week but my fears right now are consuming me. 

Thanks so much for any advice, support, whatever. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1epdi0z/recent_trauma_due_to_wifes_child_birth/,PTSD

my thoughts are fucking terrible. 

the idea that our thoughts are responsible for the good and bad things that happen in life feels like such a slap in the face because it assumes that we are always in control of what we think. 
goes hand in hand with “just move on” 
“the past is the past” “of course you feel bad when you dwell” 

also manifestation can bring into question whether my thoughts caused my trauma, and that goes deeper into more feelings of blame and guilt.

I immediately text him..
“What the fuck ! Why are you sending me graphic images for !!! I’m blocking you! I’m not even Christian for fucks sake! “ 

As I’m in the process of blocking him, he sends me that picture AGAIN.

I show my mom, she goes to his room to talk to him.

I walk pass by raising my voice ..” stop sending me that shit! Do you think I want to see blood like that ?! Do you think I want to see blood like ?!!!!! U fucking idiot ! U think I don’t remember ?!! I remember every-fucking-day !!! Fuck u !!! “

( btw , I never swear especially at my parents ^ but I was really upset ^ )

Next thing,  I’m collapsed on the floor having a full blown panic attack . It lasts almost 30 mins. I couldn’t get up, so I crawled to my room to look for a bottle of Ativan. Took 1 to calm down.

After, I looked in the mirror, the blood vessels burst around the skin of my eyes, temples &amp;amp; on my forehead.

Infantilization of sexual assault victims? Trigger warning for mentions (not descriptions) of assault,"I’m curious about whether other people have experienced this, or feel that it’s annoying in any way.  
It seems to me that there’s a very particular way we talk about victims of sexual assault, and that it’s different from the way we talk about other people who have developed ptsd.  
For example: I recently got invited to a virtual event for survivors of sexual assault where we are supposed to write love letters to our former selves.  It’s all very “glitter and craft scissors”.  
Even the metaphors used to talk about us are often full of things like butterflies and flowers blooming after a forest fire.  Very saccharine and childish.  
And when I was looking for resources about sexual recovery after trauma, everything I found was focused on gentle, romantic, candles-and-soft-music sex.  There seemed to be no general understanding that some people looking for sexual recovery might just want to, excuse my language, have fun and fuck.  I found it all very flowery and unhelpful.  
I guess I feel like it’s dehumanizing.  Like it ties in with the way we expect women to be sweet and innocent and pretty, and so when something ugly and real happens to us it’s got to be buried in sunshine and sugar.  I would far rather we just be seen as grubby little humans like everyone else.  
Am I alone in this?  I don’t see military PTSD getting the same treatment (nobody is asking veterans to sit down with glitter and craft scissors to write love letters to their former selves).  I mean no offence at all to anyone who prefers this kind of language, and I’m so happy for anyone who is helped by it.

It causes so much stress to my body that I am in severe pain for days after. 

I saw my psychiatrist yesterday and I have meds to help with my anxiety, but it got me thinking about how we don't always discuss how PTSD symptoms can manifest in ways that cause physical pain. Hypervigilance, anxiety, depression, nightmares, etc., all can wreak havoc on our bodies. I used to think I had some underlying illness or that I always was getting the flu. Now I understand how PTSD symptoms can put a great strain on my body and I try to have more self-compassion and acknowledge that my pain is real.

Another example is when you see the abuse happen, the dude tells her to cut her ears off cause she wouldn’t listen and then when she actually goes to cut her ear off he tells her not to and that he loves her.

My manager choked me yesterday.,"TW: physical assault 

For context I have been diagnosed with PTSD for years due to a couple different traumas. 

If it matters, I am female. Yesterday my boss and I were laughing about something, we joke around a lot but up until now he has never laid hands on me. He was about a foot away from me and he abruptly reached out and wrapped both his hands around my neck, squeezed and shook me. He was laughing and didn’t do it as a serious attack, but nonetheless he fully wrapped his fingers around my throat and choked me. He let go after a few seconds and was still laughing after and I was so shocked that I just nervously laughed and got away from him as soon as possible. It was not a light choke, after he did that I was sore for an hour after. 

I called his boss crying and in shock. Long story short she was PISSED and brought it to HR immediately. I was informed by her today that HR is still deciding what to do - aka, he has not been fired yet. In the meantime he is not working on Monday and I’m reporting to his boss as my manager until something is decided. 

It didn’t sink in until after I got away from him and had a moment alone just how messed up it was. I already have PTSD from several traumas and yesterday just keeps replaying in my mind over and over, I’m worried this will just be another trauma to add to the list. If he isn’t fired I’m going to be seriously scared for my safety because this is not the first time I’ve reported him for inappropriate and unprofessional behavior. They are still investigating and I’ve already decided that I am quitting if he is not fired. I love my job, I work in the mental health field and I deeply care for the people I support. But I refuse to feel in physical danger from my coworkers at work. 

I just can’t stop thinking about yesterday and I could use some kind words right now. :(

**Edit:** I want to thank you all for your advice. I talked to my former divorce attorney asking for recommendations for any of her colleagues who can help me if he is not fired. She was absolutely floored when I told her what happened and told me to contact her after work tomorrow so she can find representation for me if he is not fired. She said it would really be best if I have an attorney with me when I talk to HR but given that this is happening tomorrow there’s no time for that, so she advised me to record any and all interactions I have with management or HR regarding the situation and to act very carefully. In the meantime I’m taking care of myself and emotionally preparing for tomorrow.

**Edit 2:** I found out today that he has been fired. I am still shaken up but I am relieved knowing that I won’t have to face him again or feel unsafe/uncomfortable at work. I did notice bruising and swelling today and took pics which I sent to HR and I am sure that played a part in their decision as well. I’m seeing my doctor tomorrow and seeing what she recommends to make sure that I’m 100% okay.

I will be posting more here and hope to keep swapping stories and inspiration with everyone in this sub :)

&#x200B;

I have PTSD from an abusive relationship I had when I was 14-18 years old. I also have anxiety, OCD/dermatillomania, depression, and chronic pain.

I come from a family of entrepreneurs and was raised to be one. I have dabbled in a few different industries, spent a lot of time helping create and run newer nonprofits and community orgs. Now I'm working for a small tech company as a partner and I manage all my own clients, customer service, website, etc.

A couple years ago, I decided I really wanted to start my own business from the ground up, by myself. There was a few different reasons, mainly being that I wanted more freedom and ability to creative (my current work is monotonous as hell). Once I started digging further, I realized that I also wanted the freedom to live by my own schedule, and once I figured out why, it all came back to my PTSD.

As I'm sure you all know, there are days, weeks, months that are difficult to work through. Especially when you're in a company with strict attendance requirements or customer/client service. Even though I run my own stuff at my current day job, there is no flexibility when it comes to taking long breaks or avoiding customers. This can be really tricky to manage with PTSD :(

I faced a lot of discouragement when I started exploring options for businesses that I could run myself **that would also allow time for rest and recovery.** Everyone kept saying to me that ""making it"" would be impossible, too stressful, too much time, too much energy. But stubborn and determined like I always am, I kept researching a business model that I could gel with.

I paid for a lot of online courses and listened to a lot of ""experts"" who really believe they have the answer. I will admit that the haters were a little bit correct in that pursuing entrepreneurship is an energy drainer. BUT!! Through all the classes and mentorships, I learned one big fat lesson about running your own business - you have to deeply know yourself to be a successful entrepreneur. (I know everyone here struggles with knowing who your ""true"" self is... I know I do... so this lesson hit me HARD).

Why do you have to know yourself? Well, a million reasons. But the top ones - 1. You have to pick what your business is about, and in order to do that, you have to know what you like and don't like (not so easy for us w/ PTSD!!) and 2. You have to understand how you get shit done the best! Instead of following someone else's schedule and guidelines, you really have to craft your own, and in order to do that you have to kind of ""study"" yourself.

I did a lot of work and exercises related to this all in hopes of becoming a successful entrepreneur. And I realized that **a lot of that work was helping with my PTSD recovery, too.**

Anytime I disregarded my own ideas and tried someone else's because they were more successful etc., I would fail. Then I would stay true to who I am, the way I work, what I care about... and that's what worked.

Am I saying that entrepreneurship cures PTSD? Lol. Hell no. Is it a replacement for therapy and other forms of recovery? No.

BUT! As someone who has had a dream of being a successful entrepreneur my whole life - I really really really wish someone would've told me **all the healing and positive parts of having PTSD and running my own biz.** Instead of just throwing discouragement at me.

I could talk about this forever... I know this is a long post, but I wanted to share in case anyone else on here has **ever felt discouraged from pursuing self-driven or creative work.** You don't have to sit in an office all day and play by the rules. You also don't have to work a million hours and stress yourself into panic attacks. You can pursue what you want with self-care and your PTSD does NOT make it impossible. In fact, sometimes I think the resilience and stamina I have because of my PTSD *actually helps me*.

I'd be curious to hear anyone else's thoughts on careers and running a business and how their PTSD helps or hurts. Thanks for listening, I love lurking this sub and this is my first post :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/hwsika/i_wish_someone_wouldve_told_me_how_healing/,PTSD
Trauma Is Like A Mold,"This analogy was told me to me when I was in an inpatient treatment facility for ptsd and it really helped me understand trauma, shame, ptsd etc. 

Trauma -and the shame it comes with- is like a mold. It grows and thrives in the dark, in closed off, damp places. Imagine mold growing in a closet in your home. You can close the door, and you won’t have to look at it or even really deal with it at all. 

The thing is, when you come back to check on it a year later, two years later, 20 years later, it won’t be the same as when you left it. It will have grown. A lot. 

Trauma is the same way. A lot of people understandably want to put off facing their trauma through therapy/treatment etc until they’re in a better place in their lives. It’s inconvenient and most people want to wait until they’re done with school or more comfortable at their new job etc etc. So a lot of people close the closet door and tell themselves it’s fine and they can look at it later when they’re more ready. 

When you come back to look at trauma later, it won’t be the same as you left it. It will have grown, a lot.

Shame and suffering grows when we hide it. It thrives off secrecy and alone-ness. The burden of hiding our pain from ourselves and others multiplies it. The burden of protecting others from our reality multiplies our shame. You will see people on this sub and in other areas of treatment who are just beginning their journey and they will say “I wish I dealt with this 20 years ago”. 

The way to begin addressing trauma is the same way we can begin addressing mold. We need to air it out. Open the closet and leave the door open. Let sunlight shine onto your trauma and let it be seen. We don’t have to keep it a secret anymore to protect ourselves or other people. I’ve found that speaking the truth about what happened to us is the most terrifying thing in the world until it actually comes out of our mouths. The more we talk about it, the more we let the day light fall on it, the less power it will have over us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/hcmgw1/trauma_is_like_a_mold/,PTSD

Anyone else tone down your femininity/sexuality to prevent sexual abuse?,"Anyone else tone down your femininity/sexuality to prevent sexual abuse?

I stopped dressing feminine, wore baggy clothes, channeled my masculine energy to scare/intimidate men so I don’t get sexual attention. Yeah, I did this. And also when I was covertly sexually abused by my dad, instead of protecting me, my mom got jealous and stopped taking me to get my hair done and wouldn’t let me get my nails done even though she had originally promised. I looked unkempt growing up.

And now at 27 that I know what happened to me and have come to reality with the abuse I went through... I have no sex drive and have no interest in flirting and emitting sexual energy towards other men. Also, when I have flirted in the past, I realize I behaved like a little girl. So now I’m grossed out that men were attracted to me when I acted like a little girl, does that mean they have pedophile tendencies?

Also, I’m really intimidated by dominating and masculine men but also attracted. Like I only can be around men who exhibit feminine/passive energy right now and I get scared around dominating men who can make me submissive and thus controlled. Controlling my environment helps me feel in control and feel calmer due to my abuse history. Weird part is my abuser (dad) was actually passive and had submissive energy but was still abusive, creepy and manipulated by playing the victim. You would think I would be more scared around those types of men But I still find myself feeling safer around these kind of men over dominant because I can intimidate and scare them away by channeling masculine energy.

I am grossed out by men and don’t trust them—too many creeps out there who seem nice but then betray you. If I had a daughter I’d be so protective. It’s a scary world out there.

Do not let the “false memory research” of Elizabeth Loftus stop you from speaking up for yourself and other survivors,"Sometimes as a survivor of childhood incest (perpetrated by my ex-father) I have doubted myself for not remembering every detail that I would have remembered more as an adult. 

But I viscerally remember being a child lying in fear at night in my bed, hiding underneath my blanket, listening to every sound in the house, every footstep, hoping my ex-father wouldn’t cross the hallway to attack me. He never allowed me or my sister to lock our bedroom doors. It was almost always dark and the injuries he inflicted were internal, painful and shameful. I focused on the wall. I pretended I wasn’t there, that I was a bird, flying away. I tried to ignore, as much as possible, how my own body was betraying me. 

After family court removed him from my childhood home, I tried my best to move on. I was non-compliant with therapy. I buried the pain until they come up again when I had my first romantic relationships in college. 

But throughout my long healing journey, I have repeatedly encountered the memory research published by Elizabeth Loftus. She has used her status as a distinguished law and psychology professor to repeatedly argue adults who recall buried (“repressed”) memories of childhood incest and sexual abuse must be “faking” their memories. She has used her “lost in the mail” university psychology experiment to cast doubt on survivors’ testimony, and trains other defense lawyers how to do so. She sat on the scientific advisory board of the now disbanded False Memory Syndrome Foundation.

The way men look at women,"I want to start by saying I am not gloating here. I am an average looking woman. I’m also not here to play the victim. Nor am I saying all men do this. 

I hate how some men look at women sometimes. For example, when I’m walking around the store, I’ll see a man (sometimes even with his significant other) check out me or other women. And it disturbs me. It’s so obvious their thoughts are sexual. Every time a man looks at me with those sexual eyes, I get triggered. I end up having an episode soon after. I hate it.

Like sure yeah I'm sure that clinically you can be traumatized by academics but I feel like they very clearly mean it colloquially, and it just bothers me because I'm pedantic and want to say ""You weren't traumatized, you don't have PTSD, your life was never threatened and you don't live your current life avoiding specific sounds and scents because experience the wrong one and you get teleported back four years.""

I found my mom dead and ever since then I’ve been getting flashes of her face and me trying to get her up. I can’t make them stop.,"TL;Dr getting bad flashbacks of finding my mom passed away multiple times a day. Any tips on making the flashbacks shorter or making them less frequently. 

My mom died suddenly on February 13th without any warning. I have already been diagnosed with ptsd but this is different and worse. 

My mom was my best friend besides my husband. My husband and I live in my now only dad’s house. 

I went in her room and I couldn’t get up or turn her over. I should’ve known but I finally lifted her up up and was an inch away from her face. I hate describing it but I need people to know so they might be able to help. 

Her lips were purple, her eyes were half open, and there was stuff coming out of her right nostril. 

I ran downstairs to get my dad. I called 911. I knew there was nothing I could do. My parents had such a beautiful relationship. They only stayed in separate rooms because my mom is messy and my dad is ocd clean.

I couldn’t and still can’t believe it. There was no autopsy because my dad doesn’t want to know if he could’ve done something. He’s been a wreck. I have told him about these flashes and he said it was my ptsd. 

It’s never been this bad before. Before my mom I had nightmares, anxiety, fear, and some rare flashbacks. Now the flashbacks happen multiple times daily. I’m afraid to even see a picture of my mom who I can’t say enough was my best friend. We always said I love you daily. 


My dad thinks if I talk to her beloved sponser of over 12 years ( she was sober 16 years) that I’ll feel some relief. I know my mom would want it, I am just scared I’ll lose it on the phone. I texted and am calling today.

Never Ask A Survivor Why They Didn't Leave Sooner,"If you’re a survivor, chances are you have been victim blamed/shamed. In the past when it came to sexual assault, it was often the woman that was blamed for “asking for it.” I recall reading a book called “Can’t Buy My Love” that talked about the influence of advertisements. There was a specific rape case where the judge ruled that the woman asked for it simply because the brand of her underwear was Victoria’s Secret. Now, we are finally holding men accountable for sexual assault, but why not for abuse? There is a stereotype that low income or minority females are too “uneducated” to not leave. This is false. Abuse can happen to ANYONE of any social class or ethnicity. Abuse is rarely shown right away. I’m sure if we saw it in the first week we would have run but that simply isn’t how it works, especially in narcissistic abuse. There is a “love bombing” or “golden period” that can last up to a year or more where the narc acts perfectly, the change in their behavior starts slowly and is a brainwash process that has us hold onto the love bomb period in the hopes of them being capable of being that way again. Once brainwash is complete, abuse is the new normal and the voice in your head telling you something wrong is still there but yet you feel trapped to leave. I’ve learned a lot about this type of abuse from this account \*\*@he\_never\_hit\_me\_but\*\* dedicated narcissistic abuse survivors. The handle alone makes me feel validated since I was never hit. Never let anyone judge you for not leaving right away. Leaving is a process and often involves extensive planning to be able to do it safely. No one understands your reality unless they’ve been through it themselves.

I often associate living with a disability to playing a videogame.,"When you're a gamer, in that ""sphere"" there are always going to be people who **penalize you for preferring to play the game on Easy Mode** so that you can *enjoy* playing, instead of Hardcore Insanity Mode just to **""prove"" that you're ""stronger and tougher""** than everyone else. 

I love playing video games. I have a brain injury and I am bad at playing them. **The only way I get to** *enjoy* **playing games**, is by **playing them on Easy Mode with accessibility options enabled**. And that's how my life has to look, too, and there are always going to be people who tell me I'm **""cheating"" at life or ""taking shortcuts""** instead of taking steps to **enable my life to be enjoyable to me**.

And ultimately, when you drill down to what these people are really saying, these are people who believe that **life shouldn't be enjoyable.** These are people who don't prioritize enjoyment, hobbies, happiness, and wellbeing for themselves and so they certainly don't accept you prioritizing that for yourself. 

I've already been through enough combat. Enough violence. Enough heartbreak and literal, legal torture. The accommodations that we need as human beings with a pervasive *disorder of stress*, is to do our best to minimize the amount of stress we experience on a daily basis.

YOU CANNOT ASK FOR A DIAGNOSIS.,"I know recently the Mods have put up an extra line at the top of the subreddit, but if you are on the mobile app you don’t actually see this unless you expand the top text.

This subreddit is not a place to ask for a diagnosis and nor is it the place to give it.

We are open to giving advice on HOW to get a diagnosis, or how to deal with panic attacks, anxiety, sleep etc.

I have reported every single post I have seen asking for a diagnosis and I don’t think unfortunately this is enough as I see them more and more often. 

It needs to be blindly obvious that this is not allowed here, it is encouraging online diagnosis’ from non-professional and non-trained.

We will never not offer help, this is exactly what this subreddit is for, we want to help. 

We cannot however diagnose.

For everyone who manages their depression with exercise—I compiled a comprehensive list of simple bodyweight exercises to do if we have to quarantine and the gyms get shut down again.,"If you're anything like me, you've managed your depression with exercise for awhile and once the gyms closed down last year, it really messed everything up. Personally, I fell back into a deep depression (it was as if I suddenly stopped taking antidepressants!), turned to food and alcohol for comfort, gained 60lbs and did virtually no exercise since the gyms were closed, and didn't even know where to start other than jogging and simple things like squats.

That's why I created a full document of bodyweight exercises that require little or no equipment to help keep us all from backsliding harder if/when we have to quarantine again. Most of them can be effective even if done just a few minutes a day in your bedroom (for those of us who have trouble getting out of bed on those bad days). And I'm sure we all know how sore and stiff our muscles feel when we spend all day laying around.

This list is complete with Cardio, Bodyweight exercises, Mobility, and Stretching. I referenced videos on all of the things I figured most laypeople might not know about. I also included links for the optional equipment for both Amazon and Non-Amazon resources.

If you have any suggestions on anything else to add, I'll gladly keep building on the list! I know a lot of us use exercise to manage depression and when we can't, it becomes a vicious cycle of not having motivation to exercise and then not having any serotonin because you didn't exercise lol

I hope this helps at least a few of you. Let's adapt and conquer this time around, friends. Remember, even a few minutes helps!

"I'm about done with EMDR, and I've come to a realization with my PTSD.","I've had a hard life. Especially in my childhood. 

I know everyone has a different story. My story is a childhood of being told I was not good enough. Being told I was stupid. Then I was assaulted when I was still naive and did not understand the world yet.

EMDR showed me that my trauma was complex. In fact, so complex, it's almost incurable. I've made some progress- but when your childhood is a decade of being told you aren't good enough, being mentally abused, then physically by others- it's just, hard.

I'm never going to completely give up, but as a 30 year old man now, I know that I just have to make good with what I've  been given. I'll always have to carry a childhood of trauma around with me wherever I go. 

But EMDR has showed me that I can somewhat deal with the pain in a different manner, healthy, and more constructive. I try so hard to tell myself and the hurt parts of myself I am worth more than what I was given ages ago.

I suffered severe injuries and still haven't recovered and the PTSD from this night stops me from doing anything.,"I don't know what I can do. I feel guilty and I feel remorse and I just feel awful everyday. Ever since this accident happened my life has gone downhill. I dropped out of college in my last semester, moved in with my parents, and haven't done anything since. I just can't even leave bed and all of my friendships and relationships fail so I'm constantly alone. I don't even care about waking up anymore and every night I relive that accident. I have severe PTSD and my therapist just tells me to stop it. I don't know how I can stop it. I got pain killers when I got out of the accident and I've been addicted to them ever since. I can't stop taking them and I don't even want to but they're my only way to cope. I just feel hopeless and have no idea what to do. That one night ruined my entire life and I feel like she's the lucky one. 

She was just completely smashed when the car flipped and my bottom half of my body was as well. The images from this night are in my head at all times and I revisit this accident probably a dozen times a day. If something reminds me of this night then I just shutdown and try to get to the ground so I can curl up, plug my ears, and let it pass. It's happened in restaurants and I can't cope with it. I just can't deal with these images and events being replayed in my head. It is a true nightmare.

I'm not sure exactly what changed or when. But today, after I did something dumb (I don't remember what, something insignificant like walking into the door frame), the inner monologue said something like 'it's okay, I like myself'. 

It stopped me in my tracks - I don't remember ever thinking that before. I took a moment to look in the mirror and see myself from a positive, more objective perspective; not just in my appearance, but in the person I am.

And I am here to tell you, kids, that I saw it all, and I liked it. I didn't see some dumb, fat, dropout loser like my brain tries to portray me as. 

Instead I saw beauty. I saw a compassionate, weird, creative, fierce woman, who suffered trauma upon trauma but somehow overcame. Who even in the lowest points of her own life has never turned away a person in need. Who continues to grow and evolve into better versions of herself every day.

I'm telling you this partly because I'm proud of myself and wanna show off a little, but mostly because I want anyone and everyone out there who's struggling with themselves, to know that it's possible. It's not just something people say to make you feel better; it's real and it's attainable.

To other folk this would probably sound like the ramblings of a madman, but I feel like I've just raised Atlantis or some shit, and I knew you guys would get it.

A TMI success but one I haven't had in a while,"I have PTSD due to being violently drugged, kidnapped and raped in college. My boyfriend and I have had lows in our relationship sexually because of this. Most times I have flashbacks because he does something small that triggers me and idk how to explain it to him so I act like nothings wrong but he knows. Today before we had sex we talked about it. We discussed for 30 minutes everything we wanted to do and I told him everything I could think of that made me uncomfortable and I had the best sex of my life. It's a small success to some but being able to be intimate with my partner without fear of my ptsd and how it may seem to him is a huge step for me and I am happy to be able to have sex for the first time without any kind of trigger or fear. Normally I dont tell him during sex if I'm triggered but he can tell and he stops anyways. Today we had sex after 3 years of dating that was just us. No ptsd.

My eyes follow and observe people like a hawk  so I stay ""safe"" and avoid such people who I feel will hurt me again(which in my case translates to everyone).

As if my subconscious is taking over and shutting down what I can control in the present time. The thing is having this issue is nearly destroying my life. I will literally stare everybody down until they are out of my eyesight lol, I have caused hostility, frustration, and creeped out people, but its like my animal brain doesnt care or listen to me or their responses.

I’ll never forget the day I found out.. my dad woke me up from a nap and said “your sister is missing and your niece was found dead.” I froze in time and blacked out for a few weeks. It was all over the news and life just didn’t feel real. A few years later came the trial. I saw pictures of my niece how she was found and it’s forever burned into my brain. I think about it every day and start to feel my throat close up. I drive past a certain house we used to go look at the Christmas lights every year, and I immediately start to panic. I think about her death multiple times a day.

A few days ago, I was delivering food for Uber eats and didn’t realize the address until I got on the street. I look down at my phone, and I just so happened to deliver the food to the new residents in house my niece was murdered in. I hadn’t been there since it happened. The front door and windows were wide open, so I saw inside and it all looked the same. I had a full blown panic attack in my car on the way home. I felt my chest sink in, I couldn’t breathe, all these memories running through my head. PTSD is stopping me from living a normal life, it’s getting worse and worse as the days go on.

Therapist says I don't have PTSD because you can only get it from SA or threat of death.,"What the title says. I think I need to switch therapists. She is good in a lot of ways but tells me that I merely self diagnosed myself with PTSD and that it is not possible for me to have it unless I was sexually assaulted or was threatened with death. She doubts a diagnosis of PTSD I received from a psychiatrist. Even after I tell her about my flashbacks, nightmares, hyperarousal and everything else, she continues to reiterate that I need to stop self diagnosing myself. I don't know how to feel because when she says this to me it makes me feel uneasy but I have no idea if she's telling me the right thing or not. She does EMDR and specializes in trauma therapy so I'm just not sure why she seems to completely disregard all of my symptoms..

Edit: just to be clear I'm not mad solely about the fact she's not agreeing about me having PTSD. It's because I think it's infinitely helpful to say I have PTSD because it encompasses all of the confusing symptoms that I didn't quite know how to explain before. Part of it feels like she just doesn't believe that I'm telling the truth. I think she's a little bitter because everything she tries to tell me is something I already know. I told her about my misophonia and she didn't even know what it was. Then she proceeded to cutely say ""Oh I think I have that too! I can't stand people chewing!"" I just sit there kind of in awe at not only how irrelevant that is but how invalidating it seemed. Nobody likes the noise of chewing.

Psychedelics as therapy are very dangerous,"So I know there are people in this sub (and other trauma/mental health related subs), telling other people to try shrooms or lsd to work through their trauma. And what I have to say is: DONˋT FUCKING DO IT!!

Yes it can help you work through it and give you a more positive view of the world. I’m not trying to deny that it helped some people. 

But you don’t want to be stuck in your own head, high on lsd for 12 hours, reliving your trauma over and over again. That’s a guaranteed ticked to a drug induced psychosis. Especially if you are actively repressing some of these memories or can’t access them because your brain won’t let you. You don’t want to be on any psychedelic (or any drug) when you remember stuff like this.

Anyone else’s partner left them after revealing their trauma?,"My boyfriend (now ex) broke up with me the other night after I told him that I ran into the man who sexually abused me throughout my childhood when I went to visit my hometown. I didn’t ask for comfort, I just wanted to be transparent and texted to let him know what happened and how I was feeling. I told him he didn’t have to do anything or say anything, but that it was really jarring seeing the man again after so many years. I’ve actively been in therapy and been taking medication for the last 2.5 years. I’ve told him about my trauma before and what happened - he was aware. 

He told me that hearing about this run-in made him realize that if we become more serious or get married in the future, that my trauma would “become [his] problem,” and he doesn’t want to “be a part of that.” 

I asked for so little from him. He had been upset that I don’t open up to him as much literally the week before so I tried to open up and let him in, and he broke up with me over it. 

I feel so helpless. I can’t control what happened to me, and he basically just left because of the trauma. If it was currently affecting the relationship or if I was mentally in a bad place or not seeking treatment, I could have understand- but it feels he left me purely over the fact that it happened to me and is a part of my life story. I feel so disgusted with myself. I just wish all over again that the abuse didn’t happen to me.

A spiritual leader just shamed me after I set a boundary saying I did not feel comfortable discussing my childhood sexual abuse! Wtf!,"A spiritual leader just shamed me after I set a boundary saying I did not feel comfortable discussing my childhood sexual abuse! Wtf!

So I did a virtual appointment with two spiritual people who guide plant medicine spiritual sessions for healing. My main purpose was to ask them more about how they could help me and the different types of Spiritual ceremonies they hold. I spent over one hundred dollars to get more information about them and they barely answered my questions.

First, they ask me about why I am looking to work with the medicine. I tell them childhood sexual, racial and mental trauma. Then I tell them how I am looking for safe spaces because unfortunately I've been getting preyed on by predators in these spaces. He asks for more details about the predator experience and asks if the predator flirted with me. I briefly summarize what happened then change the subject by discussing some of the positives of the past spiritual events I went to. Then he keeps asking me for more details about the trauma and my intentions, but I continue to give vague answers because This spiritual healing work is pretty personal, independent and you actually don't need to tell your guides the specifics of your trauma. He kept pushing and I tell them I don't feel comfortable sharing my childhood sexual abuse especially because I just met them and this work is personal and knowing the details of my trauma is not necessary. I ask them what is their purpose of wanting to know? They say ""it will help him figure out what intentions I should set and what ceremonies are best for me."" He continues pushing and asks if I have a therapist? I tell him that I've been in therapy for years and also have a degree in psychology/counseling.

Then he says we are just souls that pick up stories (trauma).. So then why was he so persistent of hearing about my trauma when he is saying it doesn't matter so much?! 

 They wasted my time, it was obvious they hadn't read the form I was told to complete beforehand for them because he said ""next time you will have to fill out the form and we will discuss what ceremonies are best for you."" I told them ""I already filled out the form and did they read it?"" Then the female leader was like oh yes. Obviously they didn't otherwise they wouldn't have been asking questions that  were already answered on there. Then he kept filling up the time with random psychological information (and he is not a trauma trained individual) about our brain being stuck in child trauma.. it's like they were just trying to fill up time because they were unprepared. Then he tries to tell me I am not allergic to mushrooms and it is just anxiety. He was acting like he was all knowing and knew what was best for me and he had just met me! 

He told me to stop being logical and get in touch with my intuition. When I told them I would want to do the healing work in women spaces due to my trauma, he said he couldn't change himself into a woman.. so basically Id be stuck with him as a guide.

Then he tells me I need to work on surrendering because I am hyperprotective. I told him I did struggle with surrendering and he asked why. I said it was hard to give up control because of past trauma. He said control is all a perception and I needed to surrender.

He tells me predators I've been harassed by recently have been attracted to my energy due to my struggle of surrendering. He says ""everyone has childhood trauma and you shouldn't come to just take.. When you come to group meetings, you need to open up and give and take.. you should come with a nonjudgmental ear."" He tells me he doesn't think I am ready for a spiritual ceremony soon and that I need to do gentle things like yoga and find small ways to surrender. He says next time I come I have to be willing to share everything about me. WTH!!! So I am being ""judgemental and just taking"" because I set boundaries and don't want to unnecessarily share my childhood trauma to strangers?! Notice how they are using ""surrender"" to push boundaries?!

How disappointing that he tried to shift the blame on me when they were the ones who were unprepared and prying personal information by pushing boundaries! I feel mad and triggered. He shamed me for setting and sticking with my boundary. I also feel proud because I've come so far that I set and stick to my boundaries. The fact that someone is telling me I need to open up tells me I've progressed because I used to be called an open book! Not everyone gets the privilege of knowing my trauma...that may come once trust is established.

I ate Crunch Berries.,"TW: Child Abuse (but no detailed descriptions) 

I was severely abused by my father as a child. I haven't had any contact since I'm 8 years old. One odd memory that always stood out to me was how he'd eat Captain Crunch every single morning. Out of a white mixing bowl with a serving spoon. I remember being really little and watching him do it and I swore off ever trying Captain Crunch (or any variety of it). (I wasn't allowed to eat ""his food"" back then so never tried it with him.) I didn't want to be anything like him or have anything in common, down to his taste in cereal. 

It also happens to be one of my husband's favorite cereals but when we started dating I explained why I don't eat it and he stopped eating it too. The other day he called from the store and said they had a version of just the berries that looked like stars and were only red, white, and blue. It would taste the same but look completely different. I told him he could get it and that maybe I'd even try it. I did. It's delicious. It kind of tastes like Trix. I told him that maybe when this box runs out I'd try regular Crunch Berries and that I'd like to work my way up to actual Captain Crunch. 

I'm not like my father because I ate Crunch Berries. I'm like my husband. And my son (I'm 24 weeks pregnant currently!) will probably like it one day too. And I also found out my sister has tried and loves it. It's just a good cereal and I'm glad my brain has finally realized it doesn't have anything to do with that monster.

[TW (Child) SA] It did not happen for a reason.,"I am sick and tired of this phrasing. 

I've seen this a lot all over reddit when talking about trauma, especially when religious people enter the conversation: ""Everything happens for a reason.""

I refuse to believe that there is any reason in this world for a child to be r*ped repeatedly over multiple years. I refuse to believe that my suffering had a purpose and it therefore was a bit of a good thing. 

I was not. It did not have a purpose. Bad things happen to people who don't deserve it for no reason and I can live with that. And don't come with the whole ""Your trauma made you strong"" nonsense. 
Yes, maybe it did make me strong retrospectively, but before that it made me miserable, hurt, scared, ashamed and broken during a time where I deserved to be carefree and happy. I would want these people to look at a picture of three-year-old me and tell that little girl: ""What is happening to you right now has a purpose and it's how things are supposed to be"".
See if they still have the guts to do it then. 

I should add that I have had a great therapist and managed to overcome major CPTSD within a year after delayed post-amnesial onset. I am doing extemely well in my day to day life and I am currently pursuing my dreams without major setbacks. 

But hell, I am allowed to be angry and sad that this had to happen to me. I don't have to go to Church to understand why it did, I was abused because there are some terrible people in this world and it's not always possible to recognize them at first glance.

I am tired of EVERYONE claiming trauma and PTSD. It cheapens the real thing.,"Listen, I know trauma comes in many different forms and I know that even traumas that seem ‘mild’ to me can result in PTSD, but people seem to be claiming PTSD without a professional diagnosis a LOT. 

I don’t take pride in my trauma or PTSD, but I hate that, because tons of people are jumping on the bandwagon, it makes it seem that my actual PTSD which I earned the old fashioned way (by experiencing a traumatic event that was listed in the DSM-V) is just ‘a trend’ and not real, substantial and horrific. 

War. Rape. Catastrophic accident. Child abuse. These are things that are so horrible that your brain gets stuck in a permanent state of ‘danger!’ level arousal. These are things are so wildly outside of the mind’s ability to cope with that the mind just shuts off those areas completely. I am not alone when I say that without intensive therapy I couldn’t even remember most of the details of my rape (I do now).

"After a long time of feeling frustrated by lack of progress in therapy, I finally told my therapist something that turned it all around","Disclaimer: I began therapy less than a year ago and have only ever been to one therapist, so my experience is very limited. I have no idea if this will help others or apply to anyone else's situation, but since reading it would have helped me, I thought I'd give it a shot.

For the longest time I felt like my therapist basically chatted with me, gave me compliments (telling me how strong I was, etc) and just told me what I wanted to hear. This made me angry and so many times I would leave our sessions thinking ""I don't need compliments, I need *help!*"" I could tell I wasn't getting anywhere, but everyone I talked to who had been to therapy kept telling me that it takes time and I just needed to be patient.

I got so frustrated that I was one session away from switching to someone else. I worked up my courage a little bit, went into the session, and said ""I'm frustrated with my lack of progress. I feel like you are treating me carefully, like I am fragile and ready to break at a moment's notice. Telling me I'm strong makes me feel good temporarily, but then I leave and I'm still in this deep black hole. I need you to push me out of my comfort zone. I need to know, is there a way I can make faster progress?""

Stupidly, I was afraid this would somehow offend her. Instead, without batting an eye, she simply said ""Yes. We can delve deeper into your trauma and start getting into the heavy stuff. That is the fastest way for you to make progress. I wasn't sure if you were ready."" For the rest of that session and for subsequent sessions, she completely changed her whole demeanor/approach. And let me tell you, it was (and continues to be) so, so shitty. It's been hard. But I'm in a better place, I can feel the sadness slowly lifting, and I actually feel like I'm making progress now. 


I'm so glad I didn't switch therapists before saying that. It almost didn't even occur to me as a thing I should say. To everyone out there, whether you're in the same boat or not, I wish you good luck <3

Never thought I’d be bothered by people using PTSD inaccurately,"This is a rant… I know people do it all the time to describe something that was mildly traumatizing and say they now they have PTSD. Similar to how people will joke about having OCD or being bipolar even though they’re not.

 I never thought I’d be bothered by it that much until this morning when I saw a tweet of someone saying how they think they have PTSD from having friendships where they were too much of the “nice friend”. And it got all these retweets and replies from people relating to it because they’ve had similar experiences of being wronged by friends. And it rubbed me the wrong way. That people get to say shit like they have PTSD when they really don’t. It rubbed me the wrong way, After spending a sleepless night crying and screaming having to have my husband cradle and console me all night because of the flashbacks. Wanting for it to stop and having no solution except wanting to rip the skin off my body. Hearing my husband say “it will pass” over and over and trying desperately to believe him and knowing it will but it doesn’t help make the pain any unbearable.

I know it’s not that serious but seeing that tweet pissed me off. I wanted to reply to that tweet and ask them, oh did you spend all night screaming and crying and feeling like you were being r*ped and assaulted?

Anyone else with ptsd from sexual childhood abuse terrified of going under anesthesia?,"I’m getting my wisdom teeth out today and am freaking out. I’ve been panicking about it for like a month straight.

Update: I went and it was fine. I was very nervous so they mildly sedated me and had three female nurses in the room as well as the male doctor so I would feel more comfortable. The male doctor gave me complete control of how much sedation I wanted and said he’s worked with patients with PTSD before and fully understood my concerns. He was actually really kind and soothed my anxiety a lot. He had the female nurses put blankets over me and tuck them under me so I would feel more secure. I ended up being okay and agreeing to go under general anesthesia since the procedure was a little more complicated and painful than most wisdom teeth procedures.

I'm trying not to get PTSD. I held a man's hand while he died last night.,"I've only had a couple hours of sleep since this happened almost 24 hours ago to the minute. I was at a rodeo and the spectators had mostly left but all the cowboys and cowgirls were doing their last runs, it was much quicker than the show but I stayed because I was enjoying the whole thing so much. My son and dog had luckily just gone home. It was our first rodeo. The crowd left because it was hot and a storm was rolling in, lighting had start but it looked to be miles away and the thunder wasn't loud. It started to sprinkle but hey it's cooling us off so they keep going. Next thing I know the biggest thickest lightning bolt hits very close, I've never heard anything so loud. I paused and then we heard yelling and I just ran that direction faster than I've ever ran. A man was laying on his back, he was struck by lightning. It was so dark over there..he was near the horse trailers. An older man started CPR and he was yelling ""it's Tom it's Tom"" (not his real name) I said I can take over when you're tired just let me know as I knelt down to feel for a pulse, he didn't have one, I continued feeling for a pulse while holding his hand saying stay with us Tom we're here with you, help is right there. I saw his wedding band and I said what's his wife's name I'll find her and someone said she's not here his daughter Katie is here she's on a horse. Then the man asked me to take over, I did a few compressions and by that time the ambulance made its way there and the paramedics took over. The older gentleman left to gather his family and animals and I assume just get to safety. By this time it's pouring and the paramedics are doing CPR so I went back to holding his hand telling him he wasn't alone and Katie is alright. The paramedics had me grab a towel from the ambulance to keep the rain out of his mouth while they tried the defibrillators. I could smell and taste burnt even before they used them. My phone is ruined because it fell out of my pocket and it was raining, but I honestly think it's acting more like it's fried from the electricity. It keeps posting this before I'm finished typing. I have played Tetris multiple times. I didn't find out the outcome until this afternoon and he did pass. I still randomly smell and taste it in my sinuses. I just don't know what to think, I've only heard of this kind of thing. His daughter is only 18 and his son is only a couple years older than her. He was a veterinarian. I'm sure he was a special man. No one deserves to die alone in the mud. I just wish the outcome were different.

I let my mom have it today and it felt fucking awesome!,"So, last time I was supposed to do EMDR therapy I told my therapist I didn’t want to because the previous session had made me very angry with my mom. Well, my therapist absolutely laid into my mom, I’ve never heard someone say those things about her before but they are so damn true. She also said that out of all of her patients who have troubles with their mother MINE IS THE WORST!!

She said I grew up with a narcissistic mother and was a victim of serious neglect. Not really knowing the depth of either of those I did some digging and yeah, emotional and physical neglect and for sure narcissistic mother. My therapist also told me that my mother has never offered me a true apology for what happened and owned her misdeeds.

I called her this morning and laid everything my therapist said out, gave her all of the clinical examples of physical and emotional neglect and told her the markers of a narcissistic parent. She said I don’t know how many times I can say sorry. I asked her if she could own up to any of the abuse she inflicted on me and she absolutely denied everything and I told her until she owns up to it we are done talking and hung up.

That means no contact with her only grandchild. It feels good to finally say, no you own your mistakes, I have a fucking right to be angry and sorry isn’t enough anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/jpej35/i_let_my_mom_have_it_today_and_it_felt_fucking/,PTSD

My boyfriend purposefully triggers me to get his own way,"
My boyfriend always brings up the time I was raped. He uses it as an insult almost trying to play it off like I cheated on him or something.

It’s getting me down so much. I don’t understand what he wants me to say. I dident ask for it.

He keeps trying to stop me from doing normal things. I want to go out with my friends still. I still want to wear dresses. I still want to drink. Every time I mention I’m going to go out with my friends he will try to scare me out of it telling me I’m going to be raped again and how he won’t care this time because of whatever dress im wearing etc

I don’t want to be raped again. I also don’t want to be miserable for the rest of my life. It just feels like I’m trying to move past my rape. But he keeps dragging me back to it, blaming me for it, purposefully triggering me and making me panic so he gets his own way.

When he dosent want me to go somewhere he’ll put his hands on my neck in a choking type of way and say things like “you want this to happen again ? It will happen if you leave the house”

He dosent choke me but he puts his hands there cause he knows it triggering enough to make me panic so I’ll stay at the house like he wants me too.

It feels disgusting to know I told my boyfriend details of my rape because I thought he’d be the one to help me overcome my fear. Instead he knows that hands on my neck will scare me so he does it on purpose to get what he wants.

Who else here has problems with concentration and memory,"Where to start?

I want to start my story with the problem. 5 years ago I had a child. She had stomach problems so she kept me up for hours at night. That's hard obviously. I was exhausted. I've always had problems with concentration and memory. But after I had my first baby... I felt I was losing my mind. I could not do the simplest task like grocery shopping, let alone my job. most importantly I failed my child as a mother. I also had a lot and physical pain, after being misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia I did fasiatherapie. Which did wonders! Really. I am almost pain free. But I still felt like I was losing my mind.

I went to a special unit consisting of doctors but also a psychologist. They found  nothing physical wrong with me, the psychologist diagnosed me with PTSD.

I wanted to get better so badly, for my child. I 'confused' to my biggest secret, even though I did not really want to talk about it. I was molested for years by my grandfather. I don't remember when it started,  my first memories I think I was 5 but i think it was going on longer then that. It stopped when I was 11 and he died when I was 12.

I remember flashes, my memory of my trauma is fragmented. The psychologist said all of my concentration and memory problems are a result of repressing memories for almost 2 decades. She said, the only way to get better is to talk about it with the help of EMDR. 

I really tried but my mind resists to the point of fainting. I was pregnant at the time and the psychologist opted not to push me. But the therapy seemed pointless to both of us after a few sessions.

I don't know what to do now. I work part-time out of necessity. If I get to tired, I can't remember anything and I can't concentrate on anything.

I just had covid and am extremely tired, even working part time. My colleagues don't know about my mental health, I don't feel safe talking to them. They just keep saying to 'think positive'. When I mention PTSD they laugh and say that's what soldiers have, so I just drop it. My husband does support me. He's an angel. He is so patience, i'm so grateful.

I feel stuck. I don't want to remember. I really, really don't want to remember more then I already do.

I thought I'd share this both because I could use the support and because I think people may find solace in knowing that others share their struggles even at an older age.

I'm in my early 40's, and a father. This past week I blocked my mother's phone and all of her social media contacts. She abused me physically and mentally over the course of my childhood. She even helped cover up the sexual abuse of one of her boyfriends. All so she could continue getting a child support check. Throughout adulthood I still kept in touch, even though almost every conversation revolved around either shaming me for my life's choices, or begging me to assure her that she was a good parent. 

After finally convincing myself (with the help of my therapist) that I needed to just cut all ties, it still took me several days to block her on different platforms. A part of me kept waiting for her to notice, but nothing ever happened. It's been a week, and I'm both glad I finally took steps to cut all ties and scared of her potential reaction.

"My therapist ended our services together today, even though we both acknowledged my high support needs","My therapist, who I've been seeing for over a year now, dumped me as a client. I've had this happen before. Once it was because my provider stopped taking my insurance, once it was because my provider was moving- both times I had a heads up. 

Today, my former therapist told me that she's not suitable to treat me and that I should find someone new. This was after expressing my disturbing experience from a recent medication withdrawal to her just last week, as well as expressing my dismay in not being able to access residential care. These are both indicative of a person having high support needs. 

Instead of ending our services in a professional, reasonable manner, she was audibly frustrated enough to blurt out that she ""obviously isn't much help"" and won't be making any more appointments with me. I said something along the lines of ""so you're going to just remove the services I DO have? With no help to arrange anything else?  Do you know how long waiting lists in this area are?"" and she pretty much alluded to ""yeah, you can call the office of the practice and see if anyone else is available."" 

I called the front office and explained that I need a new trauma informed therapy provider and the receptionist told me they don't allow switching providers within the office. (Uh, okay.) I defeatedly said ""okay"" and ended the call shortly after. They, however, arranged further access to their office by talking to the president of the practice, who instructed them to find me someone else. I have an appointment next week with the new person.

Then, spending the evening beating yourself up for missing yet another event, ruminating on what they're doing, what they're talking about and the memories they're making without you. Knowing it's just a matter of time till everyone finally stops inviting you to things.

I've been on tinder lately and I met this really sweet woman (lets call her Stephanie) and we sent each other memes for a couple days. We decided to meet up for coffee and we talked for hours about music, spirituality, art, being gay (we're both women), and we really hit it off. We went to the book store and then played video games at target, and then we went to a park. We kissed at the park and her lipstick got all over my face and we laughed at each other and I felt really comfortable with her. We decided to go to her house to watch a movie.

Long story short we cuddled for a bit and then ended up having sex! It was really weird actually feeling comfortable enough to express myself like that with someone. I didn't even have a glimpse of a flashback. This probably sounds super lame but I'm really, really proud of myself. I feel like this was a huge step in healing from my trauma and allowing myself to exist beyond what happened to me as a kid. I feel like one of the reasons why I felt so comfortable was because we talked a lot about boundaries and stuff beforehand, and I mentioned that I'd been sexually assaulted in the past and that I might need to stop if I start freaking out, and she was really understanding and sweet and always really communicative. Stephanie and I both agreed that we should definitely go on a second date. I'm just really happy and gay and proud of myself and Stephanie is really cute that is all",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/7eozur/happy_rant_i_had_sex_without_having_a_panic/,PTSD

"Every since my girlfriend died in front of me, I haven't been the same.","I saw the love of my life fall head first, down a 300ft cliff... She got knocked out instantly and tumbled for 200ft and then fell off another cliff (50ft)and landed on sharp rocks...

I tried to rescue her and almost fell off the cliff as well, I knew I had to get down there as fast as possible because I was afraid she fell unconscious into the ocean, and I wanted to keep her head above water. Time was of the essence but it was impossible to get down there with out killing myself in the process. I knew that and I had to make the horrible decision to stay on top of the cliff, call 911 and let her drown.

There was nothing I could have done differently, the firefighters got there with in 10 minutes and they started searching for her body, meanwhile the police started interrogating me and I got the impression they thought I pushed her off the cliff. Everyone told me they were looking for her corpse, which reinforced the idea that she was dead.  I even thought I saw her body in the water at one point. I couldn't stop crying, I was hyperventilating, screaming, and I was pretty much hysterical... essentially, it was a pure nightmare.

I kept telling myself ""I need to wake up, I need to wake up, please just wake up, this can't be real!""

I didn't know why it was happening to me, all I wanted was to go 20 minutes back in time.
I couldn't understand why we were ok and laughing 20 minutes earlier, and then all the sudden, she was dead and I was never gonna see her again. It was an extremely difficult thing to process and I was completely in denial.
She was the most amazing woman I had ever met in my entire life, she was beautiful, smart, she was a critical thinker and she was even working on having her own ted talk about consciousness and quantum physics. She was smart but also fun to be around, we cracked jokes all day long and the 2 of us were just goofballs most of the time. I honestly couldn't believe how happy we were together all the time, it was almost like a dream, We even talked about getting married.

Three helicopters were there, the press was there, but ultimately a police drone found her. She was alive, and waving at the drone.
The firefighters were able to get her back up by using a crane and multiple ropes.
Her face was so bloody I could only see the white part of her eyes. 
I wanted to talk to her but the cops were blocking me because they still thought I tried to kill her.(I didn't)

They wouldn't even let me see her at the hospital for 2 days!
The cops asked her if I pushed her off the cliff, she said no and then I was able to see her... It was harsh, they shaved her head and there were so many sutures all over her scalp... She stayed in the hospital for almost 2 months. Fast forward 15 months and she's now able to walk again and has somewhat of a normal life, she still has brain damage from the fall, and we can't really do much anymore. We used to party every week end but we can't do that anymore, which breaks my heart, but at least she's still alive.

I want to get to the point, here is why I'm telling this story:

Ever since it happened, I keep thinking she's going to die at any moment. Every time she gets in a car or walks down the street, I think she's gonna get run over or stabbed by homeless people.
When she's eating I think she's gonna choke to death, also because she does choke a lot since her accident.( Personally I have almost choked to death 7 years ago and someone saved my life by doing the hemleich manoeuver on me.)
And every time she chokes I think she's going to die if she chokes alone someday and I'm not there to do the heimlich manoeuver on her and save her.

She took an uber to the doctor today and I'm terrified the uber is gonna crash the car and kill her. When I sleep with her I wake up in panic and check to see if she's still breathing...
I think about the accident all the time, and the way I felt when I realized she was dead.
It was the worst I had ever felt in my life, I felt so broken, and alone. I couldn't even tell her how broken and how sad I was.
It really left a mark, I haven't been the same since. And she hasn't been the same either, it's almost like the person I knew died, in some way.

I still feel like the girl I loved is still at the bottom of that cliff...

Anyway, thank you for reading, english isn't my first language.. thank you for bearing with me.

I would love to stop living in fear, I'm just not as innocent and naive as I used to be, I know the universe can take away everything that I love in an instant, and that terrifies me.
I don't want to live in fear for the rest of my life...

Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern?,"Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern?

I really liked this quote:
""Adults addicted to their own stress hormones were once  children who lived in unpredictable environments of overreaction, rage spirals, and fear. Healing is becoming conscious to when we unconsciously seek chaos, why we do it, and how often. With this awareness we can teach our bodies safety in the present."" -Dr. Nicole LePera https://www.instagram.com/p/CRuA4LrACjc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

I notice when things get calm, I often will seek out chaos, look for problems or purposely trigger myself by thinking, reading or looking at things that have traumatized me. The I find myself in a trauma vortex where I keep triggering myself everytime I start getting calm. This dysregulated state excites and arouses me. It is familiar and makes me feel less bored. I have an underlying fear of getting better, fear of change, fear of getting my hopes up for it all to go bad again, and an underlying root belief that I don't deserve happiness and love because I am bad and unlovable.

Who else is unconsciously seeks chaos due to being addicted to your own stress hormones? How are you working to change this pattern? How do you cope and stop yourself from going down that path? Also... Ugh doesn't it suck??

Who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you?,"Who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you?

I thought the way men showed they liked me was when they leered and sexualized me. I was groomed due to child sexual abuse and our sexist society... I thought this behavior was normal. I was flattered, turned on (traumatic bonding and brain changes), and was attracted to creeps. It didn’t feel like love or like a guy liked me enough if they didn’t sexualize me.

Now as I have been processing my past trauma, I realize how much I hate and fear being sexualized. I don’t want to be sexualized at all and get grossed out when men do. I don’t want to do anything sexual or even date for that matter. I now see how wrong it is for men to minimize me to a sexual body!

I was so offended recently when I went to an educational discussion and at the end of the meeting the men were leering at my body.. how horrible that sex was the only thing that was on their mind instead of my intellect and what I could bring to help them!!!

So this is progress for me to realize how wrong sexism is because in the past, I never saw myself as a feminist. I still struggle with my body being turned on by creepiness because it was what was “normal” for so long. I am actually afraid of my sexuality right now and feel shame and disgust about it especially when I become turned on by violating sex. 

However, I’m also noticing When I watch movies or see pictures of women getting sexualized, I get grossed out and triggered More than I ever have. I am now allowing myself to get grossed out by the creepers and being mean to them when I wasn’t able to for most of my life. I still have a part of me that gets turned on by creepiness and sexualization but I can confidently say it is starting to fade away especially as I continue processing my trauma and become more of a feminist. I was brainwashed by society and the abusers in my life. It is so bizarre to now see the truth and how what I was told was a lie about the sexualization and abuse of women to be normal and flattering.

 I know with time and therapy, I will be able to retrain my brain to be turned on by healthy sex with consent and boundaries completely. I am already noticing that I am being drawn to these types of healthy relationships which I am very proud of myself for.

Everyone assumes military,"I told a coworker a few weeks ago that I had a doctor's appointment and he asked why.

I said, ""No, my dad was a piece of shit"" to which he just said ""Oh, yeah, me too"" and we stopped talking about it pretty shortly after that. 

I'm not really angry about it or anything - just bored enough to complain about it - but I hate how everyone assumes that if you have PTSD you must have served in the military.

"DAE HATE when people say “it will get better” or “I went through x and got through it with praying, you should too”? Or am I just sensitive and caving to the aggression of my PTSD symptoms?","It really plants a deep seed of anger and irritation in my heart when I hear those words. I also hate being told that I have to be strong, even though I know it’s relatively decent “advice”. No shit, I have to be strong. Otherwise I wouldn’t even be here right now. 

Someone said to me that they went through a comparable minor incident (breakup of a <2 year relationship), and got through it by praying to God, saying it liberated him and made him feel so content with life. And while yes, he is valid to feel upset about it, I don’t think it’s appropriate to bring that up to compare to my bus crash and my mental recovery with it. They and their family also went on to tell me that my medication was all gateway bullshit that I need to get off of and being the passive dipshit I am, I agreed with them and went along with all of it. 

Not to mention, when I told them I have PTSD, they went on to ask about my symptoms and even asked “oh, what are your visions?” “what are your nightmares?” “what do you see at night?” and a TON of follow-up questions that forced me to go into detail that I didn’t want to. Again, I’m passive as hell so it’s not easy to say no to anyone, but I just wish people were more considerate and understanding. It’s not like I’m asking them to never talk about vehicle accidents, or to never make any quick movements, so why is it so hard to be decent and accommodate my basic needs? I’m sure people who don’t have PTSD at least know not to fucking ask about their flashbacks in detail.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/czgwxk/dae_hate_when_people_say_it_will_get_better_or_i/,PTSD
PTSD IS REAL.,"Most everyone here already knows this. This is to the people who dis-believe in it and I hope to reach the ignorant or misinformed.

The insomnia is real. No one chooses to stay up all night and go to bed at 4AM, be tired as hell in the morning ,and feel like ran over garbage.

The triggers are real. Certain movies, noises and visuals can cause anger, fear, anxiety, depression, and sadness to the point of crying (even for non-cryers). This is due to the feeling of re-living the event(s).

The trust issues and suspicions about people are real and don't take it personally. Ever hear ""I like to keep most things to my self""? That's an auto-response, nothing personal.

The nightmares are real. Sometimes nightmares of re-living the event and then waking up feeling a chaos of bad emotions; often ruining your entire day/days.

Anxiety is real and is often because of [insert event(s)]. Creating it for people who didn't have it prior.

Avoiding talking about it and avoiding things that remind you of it doesn't make the problem invalid, and aren't just ""faking it"". It's a logical, natural coping mechanism to avoid thinking about it.

An aversion to being physically touched is real. Ever hear ""don't touch me"", or the person is uncomfortable with being touched? Well the [insert event] is *likely* related to that. Again, don't take it personally.


Point being: no one fakes anything I listed above for the sake of feeling pity or ""just playing the victim"". It's a real problem just like anything else and it doesn't *only* apply to veterans and law enforcement.

Hope I could shed some insight.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/bbjjkp/ptsd_is_real/,PTSD
I just took my first shower in like ... months,"I get how gross that is ....


I use to be on point with my personal hygiene - haircuts every 2 weeks like clockwork, daily showers (sometimes more than one if I worked out), you know the basic self care things .....

Well I've spiraled into a really deep depression and have just given up on everything ..... the only thing I've made sure is that I wear deodorant and clean clothes (which is a miracle in itself ....) but then I got the flu .... and I've been sick for a few days without being able to do any laundry or even really get up and you know how you get that sweaty gross feeling? Well I finally dragged myself into the shower .... it's strange how fucking accomplished I feel at doing something most people don't think twice about

Holy shit therapy works. Crying with happiness.,"It's only in the last few years I've had the diagnosis (29f). Previously I've had counselling after a bad patch in university, then went on some anxiety/depression courses after that but it never quite fit. It was only when the mental health service asked if I'd ever considered PTSD then asked me a bunch of screening questions and it fit to a tea. 

I've had some EMDR therapy which was hard and horrible but helped. I did a lot of self soothing for my inner child. Had a lot of dissociative episodes after heavy sessions. Had terrible nightmares for years. Felt rubbish and fatigued for years. My therapist left the service but I was feeling 80% better. 

I had stressful time at the start of the year (work stress causes more intrusive thoughts and anxiety) and contacted the service again about finishing up cos I felt I still had those symptoms and they would surface with a vengeance. 

Just had a few more intense weekly sessions and the last couple have been awful. But the flashbacks were less clear. Then since my last session I've not had any sleep troubles or nightmares or anything. We rescored my questions and I've gone from around 40 to 8.  I've been discharged from the service and I've just cried with happiness. I feel free and whole.

Does anyone else get pissed they say something was traumatic when it just straight up isn’t?,"I don’t mean this in a way to downplay other people’s traumas. But the amount of times I’ve heard people say something was traumatic when it just straight up *wasn’t* bothers me. I’m thinking of two specific examples here.

The first happened a few days ago when one of my professors was talking about getting her infant child vaccinated. She said it was traumatic for *her* even though *her baby was chillin* throughout the appointment.

The second was way back in high school when I had a friend say they had trauma around cats because *one time* a cat…. scratched her. Like. Bruh. I’m sorry, do you have terrifying flashbacks any time you see a cat now?? Do you live in fear of that cat coming back?? Were you thrown headfirst into the deepest depression of your life because of it?? No!!

I get that trauma can come in all shapes and sizes but tbh it just really bothers me when I hear people talk like this or make jokes about it. I feel it makes those of us who have actual trauma and PTSD minimized and makes it seem like PTSD is just a silly little thing that’s easy to get over.

Anyway, my psychiatrist said that only people who have been in war can suffer from PTSD.  That goes against everything that I have read on the subject.

Anyone else have trauma resulting from inpatient mental hospital stays?,"Mental hospitals are fucking abhorrent environments, even in the 21st century. They cause far more harm than good toward most of their patients. I had the misfortune of being sent to two of them in 2018, and the second time was far worse (not that the first one was a picnic, mind you).

In August of that year I suffered a crippling nervous breakdown that was triggered by a myriad of factors, a breakdown that a now-ex-friend called a ""manic episode"". This resulted in me being cruelly misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder ""wItH pSyChOtIc FeAtUrEs"", which is a fucking crock of shit if ever I've heard one. I don't run around the streets naked screaming ""I'm God"", I don't smear my own shit on the walls, and I've never fucking hallucinated in my life. Yet still I am officially branded a psychopath. The only delusion I was under during this period was that I thought I actually *was* going insane. I went along with my torture because I was too weakened to advocate for myself.

If you want a detailed account of just what made my sentence in a nuthouse so abhorrent, look for a post I made entitled ""My trial by fire at Backwoods"" on the subreddit r/psychwardchronicles. I don't care to revisit all the gory details, you can see them for yourself on that post.

I will say right off the bat that these fucking cancerous institutions are committing a human rights violation by confiscating their patients' phones and music players. I know that sounds hyperbolic and whiny, but blasting music has always been a way to silence (or at least muffle) all the screams in my head. I mainly gravitate toward extreme metal because it screams for me when I can't scream myself. To deprive me of that in my most vulnerable and fragile moments is like breaking someone's legs and then kicking their crutches out from under them.

Oh, and not to mention witnessing daily brawls between patients, being surrounded by whackjobs who were way further off the deep end than myself, being forced to take zombifying doses of so-called ""anti-psychotic"" meds as a condition of your release, and patients getting forcibly injected in the asshole with Halidol. Those things weren't exactly pleasant. 

I still get frequent PTSD flashbacks to that Godforsaken shithole. I would like to go back there with my boyfriend though, just once, to take a piss on the grounds and smoke a joint and blow smoke in the useless amateur piece of shit p-doc's face. I think that would give me closure.

I don't believe in inpatient care. Only if a person is a credible threat to themself or another, and all other means of outpatient treatment have been exhausted, should sending a person to one of those places even be considered. 

I vow that I will never let myself be sent to another one of those ghettos of the soul for the rest of my life.

Coworkers intentionally triggering me since they found out about my PTSD.,"Loud noises is a major trigger of mine.

Does anyone else feel attached to their trauma?,"trigger warning: violence

A little over five months ago, I was on a bus that crashed into a bus stop, killing four people. I wasn't injured myself but I tried to help two people on the bus, one of whom I watched bleed out in a very violent way and another who was panicking while I stayed with her for several minutes. I've since been diagnosed with acute PTSD. My trauma counselor and me recently arrived at the conclusion that I might actually be attached to my trauma--that I'm resistant to getting over it and that losing the feeling of urgency and intensity would feel like losing a part of myself.

Does anybody else feel a similar sense of attachment to their trauma, especially if it was acute/a specific event? Like if they lost ""access"" to that event by going to therapy they might actually lose a part of themselves?

I held a child as they died and I am now spiraling..,"Saturday, I (34f) was staying at a hotel and a teenage girl was shot by her friend in the parking lot and I heard the screaming and tried to render aid but she passed away. I was covered in her blood. Her friends were so erratic that no one was coherent and running around and I just kept telling her she was surrounded by love and protection and even though I don’t believe myself, I prayed for her just incase she believed. All I can think is if that was my child laying there in her last moments, I’d want her to know she was loved. I’m so grief stricken for this child I had never met until the last moments of her life. I’m  fearful of the people I love dying at random now. My partner and I both went through the experience as well (was talking to 911), but he is not struggling with this. I’m having flashbacks to the moment I found my mother deceased, and flashbacks to experiencing the death of my close friend who was randomly shot at a party and died. I’m crying non stop and stuck in hyper-vigilance. I have a previous CPTSD, OCD & MDD diagnosis from these and other past traumas. It took me many years of therapy and meds and I had almost felt like I was in a state of remission.. now I am spiraling quickly.

They have successful jobs, plenty of financial and family support, go on vacations & trips regularly, have fun and spontaneity in their lives.

I HAD AN EXORCISM DONE TO ME WHEN I WAS 8,"I don’t even know where to start. I have a lot of other stories (let me know if you’d like to hear more,) but here is one that really never left my head. When I was 8 (21 now,) I lived in an apartment with my mom, my brother, and me. My mom was addicted to amphetamines and was always living in this ghostly world. I remember her doing Oracle readings with me, I remember her having seances, and I remember me having strange things happen to me as a kid that I couldn’t make sense of. I kept coming to my mom with these problems and she believed I was possessed by a demon. I remember her taking me out to the the kitchen and there was a man with a cross on. He read the Bible over me and put holy water on my head and I just remember my mom screaming “what’s your name, what’s your name!?” And as an 8 year old I was confused I was scared and I was in shock. I told her I was me and she proceeded to say it was demon speaking for me. I remember looking up at the ceiling fan And I started following one with my eyes and from there it felt like I left the whole room. That was the first time I ever dissociated and it hasn’t stopped since that day. My mom went to prison and has been clean for many years now. I just recently asked her about this and she still truly believes that there were demons in that house and that was the end of it. Not the closure I needed. I didn’t even realize this affected me for so long until a couple months ago when I brought it up to her.  I’ve never really told anyone about this story..

"I killed my grandmother, and then I did it thousands more times, and I don't know how to stop","50 years ago I went to the store with my grandmother, on the way there was a cemetery and I absolutely wanted us to stop by, so we walked up, my grandmother grabbed the handle and said that unfortunately the cemetery was closed. So we went on, did some shopping and were about to go home when I reminded my grandmother that we had forgotten something. We went back and as we passed the cemetery once again, a truck hit us on the curve. Grandma covered me with her body and took all the impact on herself. She died. I survived. I was taken from the scene of the accident to the hospital, where I lingered without visiting a family member. They came to pick me up after my grandmother's funeral, after a few days. When I realized that my grandmother was buried in that cemetery to which I wanted to see her off, I decided in the mind of the 3-year-old I was then, that I was the one who killed her.

For the past 50 years, I have been dressing up as a woman, strangling her and hanging her to re-enact the event. At the same time, I am afraid that someone will discover that I killed my grandmother. Any reenactment can end in death, because I am relieved only by the extreme state of experience on the borderline between life and death. 

It's difficult for me to talk about it with my family, who thinks there's nothing to talk about after 50 years. I can hear this for decades. They don't know what I'm going through when I fall into a complusive sequence of trauma-play that sometimes ends in psychotic states.

Success: able to enjoy sex again (TW: Sexual abuse),"TW: mention of sexual abuse

If you told me only three months ago that I would be having sex again with no trouble whatsoever... I wouldn't have believed you. A break-up, a few therapy sessions and a new partner and it's like I'm living in a different world.

In my last relationship the inability to have sex started 1,5 years before our inevitable breakup. It started with no more PIV sex, then less and less and less sexual interaction until the last half a year nothing happened. I thought it was because of my other traumas, and was waiting (forever) for therapy to start. Now I've realised that he, too, did not respect my boundaries. I became scared whenever he displayed arousal, afraid he would coerce me into having sex, which would end up being uncomfortable(painful) for me, making the next time worse. I even got triggered by his heavy breathing. (Note: my therapist has since told me that sex should never be painful. If it is, just stop. If you continue your body is expecting the pain next time and tenses up, which just makes it painful again, and there you are in your own vicious cycle)

Now I'm working on my view on sexuality, especially my own sexuality & sexual pleasure. In the meantime I've met this amazing man who always asks for consent and backs off whenever I do not give an enthousiastic yes. My therapist is delighted I get to experience this right now, and for me it's like breathing a sight of relief. I don't even have to say no, though my goal is to be able to say no eventually. For now an ""I don't know"" is enough for him to not go further. A simple stop or even just laying my hand on his makes him stop as well. I never imagined it could be that easy. No whining, no passive aggressiveness, no disappointment, just happy to be doing whatever we're doing and just staying there.

The first time we met he asked me if he could give me a hug at the end. He saw my hesitation and immediatly said ""oh, that's a no, that's okay."" I felt the need to explain myself, of course, it was only because of covid, but it wouldn't have been necesarry with him. He was fine either way. It's been that way every step of the way, and I am so glad I get to experience this cause even if we don't end up working on the long term, I now know that there are good men out there who will respect your boundaries, and I will not put up with anything less ever again. 

I am starting to enjoy sex again and I'm just so happy I do. They haven't ruined it forever for me, I can heal and it's me that gets the credit for that. I am taking my power back.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/m8psfb/success_able_to_enjoy_sex_again_tw_sexual_abuse/,PTSD

"People diagnosed with PTSD, are you ever inexplicably drawn to or aroused by the type of abuse you went through? Do any of you purposefully trigger yourselves? What is your reaction to the triggering usually like when you do that? (TW)","(Im a survivor of sexual abuse in my childhood  but don’t have PTSD). It was an absolutely horrible thing which I have all kinds of complicated feelings towards. But even though my experiences were bad, I still am drawn to the abuse, almost aroused by it. Not in action of course, but only in my thoughts. After reading some threads here, I realised how common it is to almost fetishise your abuse as a way of coping, and how a lot of us feel ashamed for that too. Sometimes the abusers do things in a way that their victim’s body “responds.” 

In one thread here a woman was saying that when she was 5, her abuser was extremely patient and gentle and performed things in a way that her body responded and was aroused (and it’s of course still very traumatising nonetheless). But there was no “violence.” But isn’t that a criterion for PTSD? Is it possible to have PTSD from those kinds of experiences?


Also, as a survivor of sexual abuse, I know I seek out fictional material with sexual abuse or other kinds of dark subjects as it draws me strongly, and perhaps even arouses me. It ashames me that I’m this way but it’s a fact. Is this a way we purposefully trigger ourselves I wonder?

Are any of you who purposefully seek out things similar to your abuse, do you get triggered by it? What kinds of things do you seek out? If you aren’t triggered by it, then what triggers you? 

Second part of the question, do any of you purposefully trigger yourselves? How do you react to the triggering? 

I was reading some old threads on here about how people purposefully trigger themselves and that’s what had got me thinking. If you search “trigger on purpose” you’ll get some topics. Here are some examples of that: [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/fbkpjm/ptsd_triggers_on_purpose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/f3ocvn/i_trigger_myself_on_purpose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/g0lhbw/selftriggering/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). 

And also [this article](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/) is a more through and interesting example of that. 

A recap of the questions:

1. Are you sometimes drawn to or aroused by the abuse you went through? 

2. Do you seek those things out in a simulated way? Either by reading, watching, fantasising, role play, etc.? 

3. Do you get triggered when you do these things? If not, what tends to trigger you? If yes, what is your response like? 

4. Do you ever purposefully trigger yourself?(similar to what this woman explained [here](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/)). How do you react to this triggering? Is it milder than usual? Stronger?

I ask these questions because I was reading an article here about how those suffering from PTSD will go to ANY LENGTH whatsoever to AVOID that experience and anything that triggers them at all costs, whereas those suffering from some form of anxiety and who have past trauma will feel a very strong emotional response and discomfort instead, and that *that* is a distinction between both of these disorders.

That sounded a little different from what I’ve read from people’s experiences on here. Is this that these people were not diagnosed with PTSD? That those suffering from PTSD will always try to avoid those experiences at any cost?

Thanks for the answers guys. Sorry if you found it intrusive or offensive in any way.

"Coworker keeps jump scaring me, I’m going to set a boundary today","I’ve been mostly a lurker on this sub but I wanted to share this with you guys because I know you “get it”. 

I have a coworker who for the past few weeks has realized I’m very jumpy and easily startled, so he’s been scaring me multiple times a day. Jumping out from behind hiding spots and making a big noise, suddenly yelling or clapping behind me when I’m focusing on something. Because my reactions are funny to him, I jump, yelp, make weird noises, shrink down and cover my head. I know he doesn’t mean it maliciously, he’s just being playful and doesn’t know my past and how being scared like that affects me harder than the average person. But it’s extremely frustrating. If I saw someone reacting the way I am, I would immediately stop. 

I’ve put a lot of work into recovery with therapy, a lot for me has improved, but my body still goes from 0-100 when someone scared me like that. That fight or flight mode rages, heart racing, quick heavy breath, tense muscles, flashes of bad memories. So far, I’ve been able to manage and act “normal”, but I’m afraid that he’s going to catch me in the wrong moment, and I’ll burst out crying or even instinctively go to hit him or something.

Standing up for myself is a huge challenge. In the trauma I went through I very much reverted into fawn mode to survive, being as small as quiet as possible, doing whatever I needed to do to manage abusers’ moods to try and keep myself safe. But I know I don’t *have* to do that anymore, I am safe now, it’s safe to stand up for myself. When I see my coworker today, I’m going to take him aside and tell him “I know you haven’t meant any harm by scaring me, I know it seems like a joke and I haven’t said anything, but I need you to stop doing it. I have PTSD, and being scared like that constantly is a lot more harmful and intense for me than the average person.”
Just something like that. I’m nervous to say it, but I think he’ll be understanding.


EDIT- update

Hi guys, I did it and it thankfully went pretty smooth. I kept it simple and didn’t straight up say I have PTSD- basically just told him it is causing me stress and that I need him to stop. He was very apologetic (it felt genuine) and said he would stop, acted kind of awkward and avoidant for the rest of the shift but I expected that. I think he will definitely listen and stop, and if he doesn’t, I can take it to my boss and HR. But I have a good feeling from how things went and felt that it will be ok and won’t come to that.

I really appreciate all the support and advice today on this post, it helped give me the strength to stand up for myself and actually say something. That’s something that’s been very difficult in my life so being able to do that was a big victory for me- I know so many of you here understand that. It makes me sad that so many of you have dealt with situations like this in the workplace too. It  sucks so much to deal with, and I send love to anyone currently having to deal with a coworker like that.

This is a really special community here and I’m thankful to have found it. You guys helped me a lot today. Thank you so much again to all of you 💜",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/tr27a0/coworker_keeps_jump_scaring_me_im_going_to_set_a/,PTSD

I responded “Oh, I thought it was just depression” and he gave me a very serious look like “No, it’s not”. When I started going to treatment I began to realize why he had that response. It really is something else, a different beast. When I started to explain the, you know, *mirror thing* to him is when he literally dropped his pen, looked up at the ceiling and just had this look on his face of “oh my fucking god not her”…..like he knew how hard this was going to be.

The trauma of gay death destroyed my life,"I’ve been in intensive therapy for about a year and a half now, and a month ago I finally made a breakthrough. 

Through EMDR ( I didn’t believe it at first, but it does work!), I came to the realization that the trauma I faced when I turned 14 years old and realized I’m gay completely obliterated my life. 

I’m getting teary eyed writing this. 

When I realized I was gay my whole entire world fell apart. My parents were going to disown me, I could never get married( marriage equality was legalized 8 years after I realized I’m gay), can’t have kids, excommunication from orthodox Jewish community, and so many unfortunate traumatic losses that came from realizing I’m gay in 2007. 

I remember my mom would say she hated gays and that fueled my desire to obliterate my gayness. Being gay at the time truly was synonymous with death if I came out at 14 I truly would’ve lost everything. I instantaneously without even realizing went into a trauma response where I destroyed my internal gayness and tragically became my own worst enemy because my gayness was inside of me and it was the biggest threat to my survival. 

After having this breakthrough I’ve never been happier. I realized in therapy that homophobia 15 years ago isn’t relevant anymore and the threat has dissipated. Trauma makes you believe and feel as if you’re still at the time and place the trauma happened. Being gay at the time was the ultimate trauma because I literally could’ve lost everything and other gay teens I knew did loose everything when they came out. 

I intrinsically destroyed my heart, mind, and soul because my gayness was dwelling on my feelings, thoughts, and existence. 
But I’ve accepted my gayness and My mind and heart have returned to me and my soul is on his way. I’ve been living as if that trauma was still true, but it hasn’t been in a long time. 

Homosexuality was never the problem, homophobia always was. 

I’m 29 and feel so behind. I’m starting my brand new life now, a life without my trauma.

Witnessed my girlfriend having a PTSD episode for the first time,"Using a throwaway account for privacy reasons.

So I've been dating this girl for about two months, and I love everything about her. As cliche' as this sounds, she's been the greatest thing to ever happen in my life and I wouldn't trade her for anything. We're college aged lovebirds enjoying every moment together.

I've been staying at her place for about a week and tonight was the first time I've witnessed her PTSD episode come to fruition. Now, I already know about her condition and that she's had flashbacks and episodes before. This all stemmed from growing up with a mother who had multiple personality disorder to where during her mother's bad days she was abused heavily to the point of trauma. As of recent, my GF's episodes have been far less frequent and a lot better, and I personally have never seen it happen. 

Until tonight.

Earlier in the day, she mentioned about having hallucinations and seeing the wall turn from white to purple wavy colors. She mentioned it was really nothing and not bad at all. I put it in the back of my mind and paid no further heed, as the rest of the day was very much a happy one, albeit I did notice her seemingly tired a bit more. 

Tonight, we were laying in bed and after some merrymaking we were chilling and resting in silence. However, soon I started noticing tears form. She claimed it was nothing, but I knew better. I hugged her and held her close, then she started balling in my shoulder. As I have no experience, I did what I best thought I could do: I kept telling her everything is alright, I'm here, and I'll protect and be with her always no matter what, hugging her as tight as I could.

She continued for about thirty minutes in my arms, then seemed to have calmed down. She was less audible but she said she felt better. I turned on all the lights and currently have some of her favorite songs playing and get her comfortable enough to get some good sleep. 

I haven't had a deep conversation concerning the specifics of how her episodes manifest, what they're like, and how best to deal with them due to not wanting to instigate a possible episode. I've entered in this relationship knowing full well about her condition and I still love her anyways and want to be there even more and help her the best way possible. She's been seeing a therapist near our college since last year, until COVID-19 happened and we moved back to our respective homes from college. She said she dissociated a lot in the past and she's had a mental breakdown episode that lasted for two weeks last year that prompted her to start therapy. 

Anyhow, as someone who can say they don't have much experience with PTSD, how can I best help her as her boyfriend? As of now, I cannot physically be with her 24/7, so I'd love to know tips for long distance help as well.

My heart races, my muscles tense, I start to growl... I'm basically thrown into fight-or-flight mode all the time. And don't get me started on the constant anxiety that forces me to be on hyper alert for my triggers.

Even short trips to the convenience store a couple of blocks away can run me ragged by the time I get back. It drains me so fast.

I have to face it, so I do. It doesn't make it any easier. In fact, its twisting me in a way. I have very angry and violent thoughts about hurting others as a result, to add to the exhaustion.

"2022 Broke me, mentally, physically and emotionally","TW: Counting down the clock to the New Year’s ring, as I am literally done with this year. This year ate me up and spat me back out and dragged me around the block. Anything that could have gone wrong went wrong. This year alone has unfortunately shafted me in every way possible

It began with my husband and I got rear-ended in the middle of January. At the end of January, My husband got Covid and was very sick with it. We got our eviction notice in the middle of February. Due to our landlord not paying his mortgage.  After My husband cleared Covid at the end of February he ended up in hospital in a very bad state with severe pneumonia to which the doctors said if he continued to get any worse he would be put into a coma and put on a ventilator. I was terrified of losing my husband as he declined so much to where he was on 50% oxygen within five days of being admitted to the hospital. 

When My husband got out of the hospital we had to find somewhere to live as we only had four months to leave. We weren’t having any luck for ages because landlords weren’t getting back to us. We really felt like we were going to be homeless due to no fault of our own. In May, last minute we got a place.

Five days after we signed our lease we were put into a position we had to foster a cousin of mine to prevent her from going into a random foster home. So I had to try to move house while minding a toddler. Fostering my cousin, blew up the remaining family I had in my life due to lies and other BS.  so the only family member I had left in my life was my husband and my father. 

I befriended a girl online in July. She attempted suicide within a few weeks of me knowing her and I found her unconscious with blood everywhere. She berated me for saving her and called me selfish and then she moved to England a week later. My husband was in a crash while on the way to work In August and that itself has been a nightmare dealing with car insurance and getting a new car as our car got written off. 

At the end of September, I went on a night out with a friend, while trying to keep an eye on my drunk friend, I was the one held down and brutally raped…I had bruises on my face, the back of my neck, and an injured shoulder. That itself has been mental torture… PTSD taking over every aspect of my life. Sleepless nights, extreme anxiety to the point I can barely leave the house most days. I can barely get myself to eat much since it. The panic attacks, the flashbacks, and the overwhelming anxiety I can’t manage my feelings anymore… I know this affecting my husband too which is hurt to see as I know he’s trying to hold it all together for me. This year has shown a lot of people’s true colours and shown us a new depth of mental health. 

I’m writing this to raise awareness, to highlight you don’t know exactly what is going on in others' lives as everyone is fighting a battle or battles of their own. So be kind, as that can go a long way with someone who’s fighting a battle you know nothing about. I hope 2023 is better!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/zo66rc/2022_broke_me_mentally_physically_and_emotionally/,PTSD

"""The Body Keeps the Score"" My new favorite book","2.5 years ago, I had a near death experience that landed me in a medically induced coma for 9 days. I thought 10 years had gone by when I woke up and I lost 30 pounds of muscle. That experiences also unlocked a lot of repressed memories for me. I was sleeping at most 4 hours a night, barely eating and I couldn't stand the company of others. I was a horrible wreck and barely able to function.

1.5 years after that experience, I was able to start therapy. I also went back to physical therapy and both of these therapists kept recommending a book to me about the impact PTSD has on us. It was written by a psychologist who has been treating trauma since the early 1970s, starting with Vietnam War veterans, moving on to specializing in treating people who have been physically or sexually abused as children.

It took me a long time to finally get this book. I was convinced the connection I had with my body was permanently altered because of this overwhelming experience. I could barely feel my left side, my throat was totally numb from the tube they had down my throat even 2 years later. The sheets of my bed made my skin crawl, reminding me of struggling weakly to move around in the hospital bed. I was too traumatized to believe relief was possible.

Then I started reading this book. Maybe this wont be everyone, but reading this book makes me think that what is happening to me is actually understandable, its manageable, its treatable and its **not permanent**. I can feel more now, things are getting better, its easier for me to de-escalate the tension and stress I feel on a daily basis.

Who else became really good at seducing men as a way to control them in order to survive?,"Who else became really good at seducing men as a way to control them in order to survive?

I was sexualized starting as a child from my father through mostly covert sexual abuse. The way I survived was by seducing and flirting with him. My mom was out to get me and the way I learner to receive love was by seducing. It became a way for me to get control in an unsafe situation. If I got the man to develop a crush on me, distract them and become infatuated, I was more able to control them so I was safe. I notice this pattern will come out especially around unsafe and angry men. I’ve done this technique when I felt I was being discriminated against, too. It gets the men to let their guard down, be nicer to me and get what I want because to them I am flattering their ego and playing submissive. Obviously this is maladaptive coping mechanism that I am unlearning. But yeah I realized recently it has helped me survive racism and sexism And to avoid others’ aggression. I also realized I liked how it kept me safe and gave me power in an unsafe situation. It gave me power over my abusers and I was able to punish men by seducing them and rejecting them and keeping myself safe. 
Sometimes I think about about becoming a stripper because I am really good at seducing and making myself Into a man’s “dream girl.”

It looked like the cool emotionally shut off guy who had seen some shit, it looked like the badass who had killed alot of bad guys, it even looked like the hero firefighter or emt who ran into save people. It never looked like breaking down crying for no apparent reason, it never looked like waking up panting with your heart pounding at 3 am unsure if you're really there or back somewhere, it never looked like feeling powerless and constantly wondering why you got to live. 

Maybe it's just me and maybe i'm wrong but now that i'm here and I've had to struggle so hard these past years i can't help but feel lied to. There's nothing cool about this, there's only pain and rage and fear and sadness and all these things I can't understand and can't fix and it drives me up a wall.

Emotional Abuse Still Leaves Scars,"﻿Emotional abuse literally drives you crazy. You constantly think you’re overreacting or that maybe you did deserve the abusive behavior. My father is an attorney so I’ve always learned to have evidence to back up anything I say, with emotional abuse, it’s very difficult to find evidence outside of a few text messages or emails.

&#x200B;

 I had tried explaining what was going on to one therapist I had while I was still unsure of what I was going through and she told me his actions weren’t abusive. So, I stayed. This is why I always recommend you interview multiple therapists before just picking one to listen to. Had I stayed with that therapist longer, who knows where I would be. After I left the relationship, the lack of evidence drove me insane. I was always in so much psychological pain. I couldn’t interact with others without tears forming from his voice in my head or having memories pop into my head. I always looked depressed and was never invited to anything as I wasn’t “fun” enough. I became very aggressive during this time. I was kicked out of a bar and the bouncer called me a bitch/cunt and I went off. Next thing I know I woke up in the hospital with two black eyes. They weren’t from the bouncer, I had drunkenly stumbled and fell flat on my face. I was so shocked to see how awful I looked, but was at the same time relieved because I was finally able to see pain. Please note that I do NOT recommend accidental or voluntary self harm as according to one of my other therapists, that is common for emotional abuse survivors. Instead we need to break our silence and educate and have people start looking deeper than the skin level and understand that the scars that lie beneath can truly be the deepest.

I was diagnosed with ptsd and all made sense to me now. I always felt that something was wrong with me cause things that were normal to me, were different to others. I always feel a little bit alone because I’m pretending to be ok.

"I want to be a psychologist, but I'm sick of what people say behind closed doors.","Hi Sorry for the long post, ive not really made a post before and my thoughts are all over the place at the moment.

Not many people I know professionally know that I have PTSD. It's something I've been made to be ashamed about after working on a psychiatric ward and now while I study my Msc.

I was on a 1:1 with a patient who was in the midst of a breakdown and was performing similar (and very distressing) behaviours as my abuser. When I asked my co-workers for help they told me they would come and assist. I was left waiting for 4 hours, (even though I was only supposed to be on 1:1 for an hour, as trust policy dictates). I told them that was not ok and to not do that again. They did it again the next shift I was with them.

At the next staff meeting I told the team about this incidence and how it should not be happening, if a staff member needs to tap out, they should be able to tap out. The manager said I was right to tell everyone and she would have words with the staff on shift that day. I was really happy to have had that conversation and to have it out in the air.

Fast forward to handover straight after the meeting, where there were 10 nurses in the nurses office, I was sitting down while everyone was standing around me. The manager walks in and says are we looking after \*my name\* or are we looking after the patients? Everyone, apart form one nurse who saw me burst out laughing. Another nurse said I shouldn't be in the job. I coughed loudly and everyone went quiet. I walked out and kept myself busy looking after my patients.

Another time my colleagues said they could never be friends with/date someone who has mental health issues.

Whilst studying my masters a student in my cohort noted how PTSD is a disease and that those with PTSD have deformed brains. Well yeah I have a deformed brain but its not my fault, I went through shit, and that effected my neurology as it would anyone.

&#x200B;

* Am I just being really sensitive?
* Is there anyone else out there who works in mental health that has experienced the same?
* Those who look after others are humans themselves, surely we're allowed to have mental health issues aswell?

&#x200B;

I think going through my own mental health issues actually made me a better nurse because I know the *depths* patients are talking about.

I'm just frustrated, I'm largely ok now, I have the occasional wobble here and there but I pick myself up and carry on fighting. I don't even know if I should carry on trying to be a psychologist. But I don't want the career I've always wanted to be another thing he has robbed from me

&#x200B;

p.s. **Please please please** reach out for help if you need it, don't be put off by a few vile creatures I've worked with. Not all mental healthcare professionals are like this, I have had the pleasure of meeting some individuals in the industry who have restored my faith in humanity (which is no small task).",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/g04z6n/i_want_to_be_a_psychologist_but_im_sick_of_what/,PTSD

My family and I survived the Afghan war. I still have trauma,"My family and I immigrated to the US from Kabul after the invasion. I still remember vividly the time when the US invaded. The sound of American aircraft flying above everyday was terrifying, you would not know if it was surveillance or bombs. My dad and I have witnessed many deaths first hand caused by American soldiers. Somehow me and my family survived. My cousins and uncles didn't. I think about this everyday. Even all this trauma withstanding, my family and I fled Afghanistan to come to the US for a better life.

A decade later, I still have very severe trauma. I have flashbacks that paralyze me in the middle of a task. And I have triggers - so many of them, some of them obvious, some of them just bizarre. One such trigger was last week, when a AC130, or a plane similar to it, flew above my house in San Jose. [I posted in another subreddit about it but the responses were callous and unsympathetic](https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/n1ay9g/had_panic_attacks_yesterday_from_ac130_gunship/). In that incident, I thought I was back in the war zone. I was frozen, fearful, and I cried.

Officially diagnosed with PTSD after surviving COVID,"I thought I was doing better and. It just spiraled so fast. I’m having severe anxiety on the daily. Feels like there’s glass in my skin. Sweating. Heart racing (I need to take meds to keep it lower cuz it’s like 130+ even when I’m sitting). Feels like I’m stuck in this weird fog. Or black tar pit. Feels like I’m suffocating. Reminds me of when I was sick and I could barely breathe. Remembering those weeks in quarantine in that empty house all alone on Christmas and it’s just a blur of fear and sobbing. Hearing my grandma yell for help as they took her to the hospital. Hearing her beg me to take her home. Crying as I tried to explain that I couldn’t. 

I have slept an average of 2 hours a night since I got “better”. When I do sleep, I am apparently screaming and crying in my sleep. I hardly sleep enough to have dreams anymore but when I do they are nightmares. Hardly eating. Can’t focus. Can’t focus at all. Not even on fun stuff. Keep buying more stuff thinking one of these purchases will be good enough that I can actually have fun again but it’s useless. It’s just all gathering dust in my room. 

I need to learn how to be human again and it’s hard. Especially with a family pressuring me to hurry up and be normal and be okay because they don’t like seeing me struggle.

I was crying and kept thinking about how I was a burden, no one cared about me, and everyone would be better off if I died. He responded and said to take deep breaths and try to get some sleep. We’ll talk about it tomorrow. It’s tomorrow and we talked about it. He told my stepmom about the text, and the three of us talked. They didn’t brush me off and they didn’t say I was a burden. They said they’d already started looking into solutions this morning before I’d even woken up. They said they wanted to find a therapist and talk to them about what would be best. That they thought I might need medication, but they wanted that to be a last resort. They’re getting me natural things to try right now. Like a vaporizer for my room with essential oils meant to calm you. They’re looking into techniques for what to do if I have another anxiety attack.

"Dear Brain, you repressed that shit for a reason. Don’t go randomly remembering it, especially without warning.","I saw a post on one of the advice subs (idr which one). Basically this guy was having sex with his girlfriend and she asked him if he wanted to watch her have sex with his friends. 

My brain went... “Hey. That sounds familiar. Give me a second while I dig into that.”

Then I suddenly remembered... My extremely abusive, hyper-sexual ex... I think it was the same week, maybe even the same session (it’s all a blur) where he took the condom off and proceeded to fuck me despite me screaming no and pushing on him and crying...

Before all that he had asked me something about him watching me have sex with guy friends. He brought up a specific friend, Daniel. I told him I was uncomfortable with it and I didn’t want to do it or think about it. 

Later, he proceeded to describe it in detail while we were having sex once. Just thrusting that image of my platonic friend fucking me while he watched. 

I wasn’t able to look Daniel in the eyes for weeks. I got paranoid of every moment around him. 

Eventually we got back to normal. We’re not even that close anymore. But I hate what my ex did to me. And that friendship. 

You know.... I saw on social media that that ex had wrecked his car. I saw the pictures before I read the text and I found myself... Disappointed when they said he had walked away without a scratch. 

Fuck him. Fucking die for all the shit you did to me. For the bruises and the pain and the coercion again and again. For the gaslighting and the suicide threats and the rape.

I got into talking about how my brother had been in the army and I really looked up to him. He asked where my brother was at now and if he’s still in, and I said “no he actually passed away” and then it turned into him asking me if it was service related and what happened and how old I was when it happened and I was crying the whole time I answered his questions.

why do abuse victims always have to be the bigger person?,"I had a horrible end of a pretty toxic relationship (death threats of loved ones. Hooray) this person has been harassing me on social media since the breakup. At first, I figured he'd just let it go. So I didn't block him. But then he called me a whore on one platform, so I blocked him. (the funny part is he cheated on me. So idk how I'm the whore in this scenario, but whatever) then a few months later, he sent me 69¢ through PayPal. No message attached or anything. Just 69¢. And that's when I realized this wasn't going to stop. So I systematically went through to every platform I had a profile on, and if there was a way of contacting another person on there, I tried to see if he had an account and blocked it. 

A year goes by. It's blissfully silent from his idiocy, except in my trauma dreams, but those I laugh away because they're dumb AF. Then this mother fucker is doing this shit again with new profiles, but instead of calling me a whore, now he's calling me a liar (which is but isn't true. That's a whole other thing. We don't have the time for that.) He even has his current girlfriend in on it, too. 

And I just want to go off on him. And ask, wtf do you want? You're acting like a fucking child. Grow the fuck up. How sad is your relationship that you roped her into harassing your ex? What kind of lies did you have to tell her about me for that? You think I believe the world is fucking me over when it's my own fault? Well at least I can take responsibility when I fuck up and not blame everyone else around me and put myself on a pedestal so fucking high, there's no longer any oxygen getting to my fucking brain. 


But can I? Realistically, sure. I could. But he's volatile. Doing so would only cause more problems. So as the victim of his bullshit, I have to just *take it* and do essentially nothing. Not even restraining orders are good enough. The lengths to which you have to go to get a permanent RO for it to only be good for 5 years? Please. And my ex literally doesn't care about any law. At all. He's some backwoods inbred hillbilly. (don't ask why I dated him. I was being a fucking moron for so long. And stuck in a cycle.) 

I'm just so sick of having to be the bigger person while the abusers get to do whatever the fuck they want. Unless it's active violence or in person, the cops can't do shit, either. I know. I tried. Multiple times.

Anyone else get PTSD from a parent with BPD?,"I took my comment from another thread to start this discussion:

My mom had BPD and abandoned me when I was 3, thankfully my dad was amazing and held onto me. Whenever i would see her (starting again at age 6) her symptoms would have her be extremely volatile. She wouldn't give me affection unless it was a show for someone else, called me her niece in public for a while, drank all the time, and made her adult problems mine. I had to escort her out of family parties at 10 when she would get drunk and belligerent. When I was 13 or so I remember she spit on me. When I was 16 she chased me into a bathroom and told be she was going to beat my ass because I started calling my step mom ""mom"" too. I never called her by her name to her face, she just didnt want to share. Following 16, she started with a lot of false suicide attempts for attention, which I always treated seriously. Our relationship was so weird. First she didnt want me, then we were familiar strangers, acquaintances, distant cousins, and then friends.

Until her last suicide attempt, that accidentally went through. The table broke under her. The police I called called me to come down.  It was the day before her dads 70th birthday, and I had to tell him to his face that his daughter was never coming back. 

I did her makeup for her viewing. It's the least I could do. I loved her so much, in the most damaging way to myself. I put up with everything because it was obvious her BPD made her suffer and everyone except her family left her. I couldnt stop grasping for the love she wasnt able to give. 

Now I struggle to get and keep jobs. That was only the worst thing that happened to me. I had a marriage with a man that was practically the Male version of her, and I was raped after I left him...I got catfished...please dont call me stupid I was vulnerable. It took 9 months to meet.

My fiancée broke up with me bc of my sexual ptsd,"She refused to admit it, but two weeks ago she dumped me out of no where, and when I returned to our shared apartment after visiting family, to watch the cat while she went to visit her family… I found multiple used condoms in the trash. Tons of empty beer bottles… an uncapped lube bottle on the nightstand… 

I’m gutted. I tried so hard to work past my trauma from being SA’d 3 years ago and it wasn’t good enough for her. I couldn’t “ just get over it” fast enough

I’m never gonna be worth anything to anyone. No one wants to date a guy who’s afraid to have sex…. Not even someone who claims to see you as their soulmate…


Edit: we were together for 7+ years, and friends before that. The assault happened 3 years ago. We were very compatible both in the bedroom and out before the assault. And after the assault she assured me my trauma wasn’t an issue and that she would be patient with my healing. Literally said that up until the minute she dumped me. And still said it afterwards. This event has proven to me that she didn’t have the guts to just be honest.

"I kindly pushed back on someone in a mental health group saying that the difference between a victim and a survivor is that a victim can’t get over what happened to them, while a survivor overcomes","I was waiting for someone else in the group to say something because it was really insensitive and way over simplifying the impacts of trauma. I understand the desire to want to distill things down into sayings like this and I think it’s totally great if that works for you, but sharing a sort of purity test on whether you “wallow or push on” as whether you’re a survivor or not isn’t great for the group imo. 

I decided to respond and I made sure to acknowledge that I can see the point they are trying to make, but that it’s not that simple. I took my time to explain that having ptsd, I have flashbacks and other symptoms that can be extremely difficult to manage and I do wallow. I probably will never “get over” what happened to me. That doesn’t take away from my strength and resilience. We are all survivors, healing is not linear and it’s important that as survivors, that we can identify with our strength and resilience even if we wallow, cry, feel miserable and stuck. The journey is unique for everyone so let’s not over simplify, let’s not put so much pressure on ourselves or others. 

They responded with being snarky about the amount I wrote and then reiterated what they had said, saying that’s what it comes down to, “nuances and excuses aside.”

Yeesh. Anyways, I’m proud that I said something because I normally don’t speak up. I’m not personally bothered by this person, I was just trying to bring a more inclusive energy to the group, but I guess I am sooo tired of this kind of mentality being so pervasive and I’m a little bummed out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/158sy97/i_kindly_pushed_back_on_someone_in_a_mental/,PTSD

My Story Summarized,"I died six years ago, a victim of domestic violence. You don't hear our stories because we are called liars, babies, not man enough, stupid, etc. ""Who are they going to believe, a 6 foot tall man or a 5 foot tall girl"" I was often told when I said one day I would run away and she couldn't find me. She would punch herself in the face and say I did it. She would grab hammers and threaten to bruise herself and say she would tell the cops I did it and she would get a warrant out for my arrest if I tried to leave. I was trapped.

Men can be raped as well. My abuser raped be on several occasions. If I couldn't get it up after hours of abuse I was called every name in the book and told ""What kind of f****t can't get up to an attractive woman?"". If I refused she would tell me there would be ""consequences"" and never describe what they were. Sometimes she would say things like ""I will wait for you at your mom's and you will see the consequences"" which typically made me do whatever she wanted. If I ever finished too quickly she made me sleep on the wooden floor in the corner of the room as punishment for ""using her like a piece of meat"".

I have been free of her for 3 years but her words and actions still haunt me. A simple nod or a juice container can send me into a panic attack. Those around me look at me like I am some weird weak man. They don't know the stories of men like me because no one cares about our stories.

Johnny Depp may know from his situation he is dealing with. But even in the press he is slandered on the fact he is a man. I know people will not believe my story too. My abuser has spent years creating paper trails and stories for this very moment. She's made me say multiple times that I was the abuser just to calm her down. She's hit me behind closed doors and screamed at me that I was hitting her. She took complete control of my finances. I was not allowed to make a purchase without her approval. I worked full days while she sat and took money from my account into her private account as she watched television. She made me put mint oil on my crotch when I told her I was reading an email but was really playing a game on my phone as ""punishment"" for not watching her get ready. 

She made me get rid of my dog and didn't let me see my family other than maybe once or twice a year. She made me lie and tell them all I was homeless to get money even though I was well off to fund her trips to Louisiana, New York, Spain, etc. Every day my appearance was scrutinized until I acted and looked almost exactly how she wanted. She turned most of my friends against me with lies and half truths.

Everyday I struggle to just get to the next day. I don't sleep. I can't work more than a few hours a day. Constant flashbacks keep me trapped in my head. Depression and anxiety make things like answering the phone near impossible and medication has not helped because the memories don't disappear.

it was really difficult to hear but i am coming to accept it.

i posted here the other day with my symptoms and today i talked over it with her. while i had most symptoms of ptsd i had not been able to believe it because i did not experience flashbacks. however she said not all people with ptsd experience flashbacks because we might have buried the memories very deep, but it comes out through our bodies, which is definitely what i experience, based on her observations. i thought this was interesting to share if anyone else doubts themselves. talk to a professional if you can.

Something I’ve found helps when grounding can’t bring you back.,"So my flashbacks tend to be very hard to come back to reality from. Sometimes I’m stuck in that moment and no matter how many times I say i’m not there, I’m in the present, 5 senses, all that; I still can feel stuck there. 

One thing I started to do is like, focus on something OTHER than the event but it’s still in that flashback time. 

So for example, my flashbacks are related to a sexual assault. Rather than focusing on the action itself, I try to remember what the stairs looked like. We were in a basement when it happened, so I try to picture the stairs and then maybe the walls. 

Another time, I tried to remember what was on the tv, or make up something to be on the tv. 

So maybe you’re stuck in the moment, but it’s a little more bearable if you’re not stuck on the action itself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/c5lywd/something_ive_found_helps_when_grounding_cant/,PTSD

"After you tell people you have PTSD, do they ever respond with “from what?”","I want to know if this is a common experience because it’s happened twice now to me.

I told my Dr I had PTSD because I was seeking some relief possibly in medication. Her first question was “from what?” Um, I don’t know, trauma??? It caught me so off guard. I didn’t think anyone would just like… ask me what my trauma was, especially in a seemingly nonchalant way. It was just so odd, but I brushed it off as perhaps a one time thing, or something medical. (Edit: Yes, I know drs are supposed to ask questions, but the situation made me deeply uncomfortable either way. This post is referring to the discomfort we can feel when asked this specific question. Please stop making comments on this particular experience, as that is not what this post is about.)

Second experience was during a heart to heart with a friend. He had just been telling me about his trauma because the situation we were in at the time was very triggering to him. He likely has PTSD, so I told him that I had PTSD as well as we related to each other. Another “from what?” that caught me off guard yet again. I just like stammered for a sec because what do I even say?

I understand how people can be curious because yeah it DOES prompt curiosity. That would be the first question to pop into my own head too. But I don’t know if asking questions like that is very respectful to us who had to live through situations so awful that they caused our brains to physically change. Idk.

I don’t understand why therapist don’t diagnose CPTSD. They generally only diagnose PTSD.,I personally think there is a dramatic difference between the two. When someone (like myself) has been through so many terrifying situations that you can’t narrow down the exact cause of your PTSD they really should confidently put such people down for CPTSD. I feel it helps the next doctor or therapist understand that they are a bit more complex and probably need a bit more assistance understanding their emotions around many life traumas and not just one huge traumatic event.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/165gfe8/i_dont_understand_why_therapist_dont_diagnose/,PTSD

It's just hit me how young I was during my trauma,"Today is my nephew's 12th birthday. I was watching him play with his 10 year old brother and suddenly it hit me like a ton of bricks that I was even younger than them when I was groomed by a paedophile.

They seemed so young and innocent playing together, it shocks and sickens me how someone could even think about taking that away from a 9yr old. I loved High School Musical. My room was pink everywhere- the walls, carpet, my bed etc. I doted on my Siamese cat, Lola. I loved my two pet rats but was allergic to them. I used to excitedly wait for my dad to get home from work so I could play on the PS3 with him. I would go for walks with my nan on the weekends along the beach, and run off and twirl towards the sea to feel free. 

Then that October I met someone on MSN who I thought was 13... and it escalated from there. My innocence was ripped away from me. From then on, all I knew was fear. Anxiety. Crying. My mum couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. I kept it secret for all these years, terrified whenever the phone or doorbell rang that it was him coming to get me. To tell all my family how disgusting I am. 

It's never hit me how young I was before. This is the first time my brain has actually allowed me to think about all of this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/mgc7dw/its_just_hit_me_how_young_i_was_during_my_trauma/,PTSD
"My trauma story. I swear it's true, I can't make this up. There is HOPE!","Cliff notes of my life:

My dad murdered my mom when I was 1 years old, which sent me to foster care then to an emotionally abusive grandmother. 18 years of horrible bullying by my peers because I had a cleft lip and palate.

I fixed all of that only to have a child who inherited an extreme expression of my genetic abnormality that caused my cleft. She had tetrology of fallot (a serious heart abnormality) and other issues. I won custody and worked very hard to get her to a point to attempt a repair of her heart. In 2007 She was 3 and I made the decision and took her for surgery. 4 surgeries and 10 days later I was forced to make another decision. I scheduled the time to end life support and had to watch. Was the final straw.

11 years of alcoholism later (July 5, 2018) I drowned while intoxicated in front of my healthy 3 year old and 10 year old. 10 minutes underwater, 3 days in coma and thought to be brain dead, I woke up.

Took me 1 more year to get completely sober. Sober since June 2019 and I have also conquered my PTSD. There is HOPE. Do not give up and please get help.

"All this ""I can't breathe"" stuff (masks and otherwise) is triggering my PTSD","I've seen many people say stuff like ""I can't breathe"" about masks. Some even compare it to George Floyd's death. It triggers my PTSD and I can't stand it.

I can't even watch the video George Floyd because it'll give me flashbacks. My abuser used to pin me down and sit on me when he thought I was too ""out of hand"" (I wasn't, I was usually just upset when he did this). He wouldn't get off until I calmed down, despite me telling him I would call down if he just got off of me.

I have autism and sensory processing, so it was only harmful to me. I can't even describe it. I won't go into detail, but it was horrible.

He ignored my pleas every time. He refused to listen when I said it only hurts me. I remember that I've even said ""I can't breathe"" and he didn't listen.

I can still recall his weight on me. How I felt like I couldn't breathe. How I begged for him to get off of me, but he wouldn't listen. How he would then play the victim because of the marks I left when I reacted to what was practically torture for me. How one time my mom was begging for him to get off of me, which he ignored.

Mental health terms as buzzwords,"I don’t know about anyone else, but I’ve gotten really sick of the colloquial use of terms like PTSD, trauma, OCD, ADHD, etc. as throwaway descriptors for trivial experiences. 

For example, someone told me recently they had “childhood trauma” from eating a chocolate as a kid that unexpectedly tasted like coffee. I had no idea how to respond. Hearing the word “traumatic” thrown around like it means “mildly unpleasant or inconvenient” makes it so much harder for me to feel comfortable talking about my PTSD. I’d love to be able to refer to it like any other disability or physical health issue, but it’s becoming harder and harder to feel like I’d be taken seriously. I get that people use humour to deal with topics they feel uncomfortable with, but it’s already such an isolating experience on its own, and this just makes it worse.

Should I find new friends? Why do people not take rape seriously?,"Maybe I have the wrong people around me, but it seems like the people I know just don't care. I was at a festival a week ago and saw a guy who raped me a few years ago. I froze when i saw him, hell at first i dissociated so hard that I barely recognized him, but managed to get out of the situation without breaking down. Later on, back at ny friend's camp, I told my ""best friend"", in quotations because I seriously don't know if she is even my friend anymore, and she just said ""Okay"" and started talking about something else. I told my brother and he didn't say much either. So I left it be.

At the bar I used to spend my saturday evenings everyone believes my rapist because ""he wouldn't do such a thing"". I'm not welcome there anymore.

And before you flame me, I know I should have gone to the cops back then right away after it happened. I KNOW! I kick myself every day for it. I got raped and abused a lot when I was a kid and getting raped again triggered my PTSD so severely that I was completely out of it for weeks after it happened. I was too fucked up to go to the cops. I had no one who would have helped me, even my bf at the time. The dude was his best friend at the time, so I guess I know why... 

I'm sorry, by now I am just ranting. I know I should have reported him when I still had enough evidence and that's probably why not everyone believes me but goddamnit, I'm just so done with everything... People often come to me for help and advice when they feel down, I cheered up my ""best friend"" for weeks after her ex broke up, but when I have something on my mind, it just seems like it's not worth their time.

So to the point; I need new friends, don't I?

Please rethink the advice you give here!,"I understand the importance of validating the pain that other people have faced in this community. I really do. But that can be done without spreading misinformation.

Not everyone who has experienced a traumatic event will develop PTSD! 

You do not need to experience symptoms directly after the event. In other words, delayed onset is possible. 

If you have experienced a traumatic event, give yourself time to heal. It’s normal to ruminate about past experiences. You may suffer from grief, depressive symptoms, anxiety and/or anger afterwards, and that’s okay! 

PTSD is a mental illness/psychiatric disorder. It has its own specific set of symptoms, and it does not only describe adverse feelings after experiencing trauma. 

PLEASE quit telling people that they probably have PTSD when they haven’t given any information to indicate that. I understand that a lot of you are simply trying to validate others, but it can be *harmful*! If a person makes a post describing that they have just experienced something awful, they’re feeling stressed, overwhelmed, depressed, etc as a result, do not jump to conclusions. 

Saying “Yep, you could definitely have PTSD” may sound synonymous with “wow, that’s very traumatic. I hear you and your pain is valid,” but what you’re really saying is: “Wow, you went through a very traumatic event and it sounds like you’ve developed a mental disorder too.” *It is not always comforting!!* 

Truth be told, none of us are qualified to suggest diagnoses to others. None of us are qualified to tell someone if their trauma could or will develop into PTSD. Offer support, not psychiatric advice. It’s misleading and can be potentially harmful to a person who is already in a vulnerable state.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/sk2zw7/please_rethink_the_advice_you_give_here/,PTSD

Being triggered by our President.,"This sounds stupid I know, but I’ll try to explain.  I had to deal with a lot of gaslighting growing up.  It made me question myself my whole life and made me feel like I didn’t exist.  Trying to get help is a nightmare when your abuser is able to hide and deny that anything ever happened.  I was denied healthcare and food throughout my childhood.

I can’t believe I’m watching the country being run by abusive people that commit crimes and lie about it.  And the other party seems almost complacent by not arresting or fining those who are in contempt.

I feel like I’m living with my childhood abuser, and my guardian is turning a blind eye.  

Does anyone else feel this way??  Somebody please tell me I’m not the only one.  I feel like I’m losing my mind, obsessively reading the news every day on the chance that I might see some justice.  It makes me ill and I can’t stop obsessing over it.  I feel so stupid, but that’s what this illness is doing to me.   How do I stop? It’s almost all I think about anymore.   I can’t handle that my abuser got away with everything and I’m watching it happen all over again.   It’s a nightmare.


Edit:  Thank you all for your kind words and support!   Talking about this made me feel so much better because of y’all.    I’m going to try and block news sources and as one of you suggested watching Steven Colbert more lol.  I also love John Oliver! 


I can’t thank you enough for making me feel less crazy.   I feel like when I bring it up in real life, nobody really cares and they’re just like “yeah it sucks, oh well”.

Does anyone else have a heightened sense of justice?,"Even towards things that didn’t happen to you? I’m not sure if this is a side effect of CPTSD but it mind boggles me that some people would accept disgusting treatment and try to justify it. It makes me wonder if these people actually love and care about themselves because if they did they wouldn’t allow such treatment to happen to them and find excuses how it’s okay. An example is me being a scapegoat child in a narcissistic household. Everyone in my family is okay with my narcissistic mother’s treatment and thinks it’s normal because she’s the “mom”. Meanwhile, I’m furious at how dumb they are and at how much they hate themselves. It’s a lonely feeling, being around people who brush off abuse like it’s nothing while I’m in knots over it. It’s absolutely bizarre, words can’t describe how weird it is. A person who doesn’t experience self-hate wouldn’t allow and enable abuse. Also abusive relationships. My dad is still with my mom despite her abusing him mentally and physically. Like how could a person hate themselves this much and continue to stay with a person who treats them like shit? I feel like a monster compared to them because no way in hell would I stay quiet to this type of treatment. I can’t even picture it, it’s so alien and weird. I’d have no problem with being homeless or fired from a job if it meant fighting against those who wronged me.

The nurse was super nice and talked about the weather and my outfit as a distraction and by the time she had complimented my outfit it was all over with.

does anyone else get overwhelmed/feel weird during sex scenes in movies?,"cw: parental abuse implication, porn mention

i'm a 20 going on 21 year old man and i'm really embarrassed to admit this, but whenever there's a sex scene in a movie or even a really raunchy one (like in the lewd rom-coms, y'know? i can't explain it), i feel really... weird, like i want to crawl out of my skin. 

my parents like unwinding in the evenings with netflix and hulu, which is totally cool and natural-- but they always seem to gravitate to these kinds of movies. (both of them being sexual in front of me, my father in particular, is a separate issue that i won't get into here, mostly for the sake of brevity) my mom likes horror movies, and a lot of them have some pretty weird/fucked up sexual scenes. it's kind of a nightmare living in the same house as two people who always blare movies like this, if i'm being honest.

i also have a hard time watching porn because of this. this wasn't really a problem until earlier this year, and it doesn't really affect me as negatively as the stuff i mentioned in the previous paragraph, but i still thought it was worth mentioning.

something about watching people be sexual with each other just makes me feel gross all over.

The Neurobiology of PTSD explained,"Hey yall! So I briefly wanted to explain some of the neurobiology behind ptsd, cus this will give insight and possibly allow you to make some good decisions regarding treatment. So essentially as you probably know, trauma puts us in a chronic fight flight freeze state. When were in fight or flight, our cortisol rises very high giving us the energy to do so. But after a certain point of too much stress, our cortisol downregulates and we freeze. Its our bodies way of saying, ""nope this is too much i cant fight anymore so this has to stop"". When were traumatized our bodies neurochemistry gets thrown way off, so we develop high levels of glutamate, norepinepherine and sometimes dopamine but not always. Our serotonin levels may drop as well as GABA cus when glutamate and norepinepherine go up, serotonin and gaba go down. So were constantly flooded with excitatory neurotransmitters and not enough inhibitory neurotransmitters.

Along with this, high levels of glutamate become excitotoxic, resulting in shrinking of the hippocampus and cell death in the brain. Yes, keeping our stress levels so high in ptsd can cause actual brain damage. Its why for so many people, lamictal/lamotrigine has helped immensely with their symptoms. It reduces glutamate which inadvertly reduces norepinepherine and allows serotonin and gaba to increase. 

Researchers hypothesize that the hyperarousal component of PTSD is mainly due to the high norepinepherine keeping us im an overly sensitive state. Some people have found relief in medications such as clonidine which lower norepinepherine.

Also researchers hypothesize that high amounts of  excitatory neurotransmitters may be the cause for dissociative states, because they keep the body constantly overstimulated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/oumlcn/the_neurobiology_of_ptsd_explained/,PTSD

seeing his body left and right,

she turns into herself and stabs her heart,

OVER AND OVER AGAIN,

screaming inside.

She's lost inside, doesn't know how to go forward,

she's lost inside, lost inside....

see the trees stand firm and present,

take a breath,

One of my biggest fears came true - I had a flashback in public and a random person was really rude and judgmental,"I was at a store and saw an upset kid who reminded me of a kid I'd met in Afghanistan years ago, a kid who witnessed something a kid should never, ever witness. I was there too, but I was 19 - the poor kid was 6, if I remember correctly. I can't even imagine how much worse it was for him.

Fast forward to 2024, I see this kid at the store about his age who for some reason looked almost just like him. I don't know what he was upset about, but he was upset about something. I think he lost his parents in the store but I'm not sure. He turned, made eye contact with me, hugged me (or as much of me as he could reach from his height) and started crying. Long story short, I ended up on the floor right along with him, holding him and bawling my eyes out. 

This one lady walks by, looks at me, and says, ""What the fuck is wrong with you? What are you trying to accomplish? You want attention, well you got it - now what do you want?""

I could barely say anything but I managed to tell her that he reminded me of someone I'd met years ago. Something like that. I don't remember exactly what I said.

SA PTSD not taken seriously,I have PTSD from childhood trauma including CSA. I was diagnosed when I was 17 but had it for basically my whole life. When people find out I have PTSD there is usually one of two reactions. “But were you in the military?” Or “oh me too. Men are so weird.” The “this is gonna give me PTSD.” Jokes also just really irritate me. PTSD isn’t cute. It isn’t some quirky joke. Men especially always doubt that I actually have it especially when I say it’s from my childhood. My last ex was a combat medic and suffered from PTSD after sustaining a TBI while in combat. He understood me on a level nobody else ever has. I was recently texting friends in a group chat and one of the guys happens to have a combat centered job. I had mentioned my PTSD after he did and he said “oh really? have you been shot at or been blown up?” In a snarky way. It pushed me over the edge. I just said “no I was molested.” And it got real quiet real quick. When will people stop demeaning people that have developed PTSD as a result of something other than combat? I’m so over it. Having people demean my trauma and the illness I live with as a result of it is so draining.,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1cw8jd9/sa_ptsd_not_taken_seriously/,PTSD

the body keeps the score and dry needling,"Probably if you've been in counseling for ptsd, you've heard of the book, or at least the concept that your body holds on to tension and trauma from the past. Yesterday, I went for dry needling therapy for a partial muscle tear and some muscle imbalances. Very painful therapy. They work on your trigger points by poking it with acupuncture needles. I could barely walk to transit after, and I cried the whole way. Yet, just before in the therapy session, the practioner seemed very impressed that I could take so much pain that he gave me extra needling up my spine and around my neck. I took an epsom salt bath that night, as recommended, for the soreness.

Today, I woke up and felt weird in my body. I sobbed for about 15 minutes. Then, I had a miraculous kind of feeling. An inzcredible lightness of being. Sort of like falling in love. It's the lack of tension around my heart. I was sort of scared to go to work because my emotional body armor was missing. I wasn't sure if I could be around people without that physical barrier. It's taken me years to build up such a thick layer of tension!!

Just wanted to share how ptsd manifests in my body.

Edit: Since the treatment I've found it a bit emotionally daunting to be so open. I'm crying a lot easier. FYI, one of my major symptoms of PTSD has been dissociation. I dissociate on a physical level and often won't notice an injury until I see it in the mirror, or somebody asks me about that bruise. It's a bit shocking to be alive in my body just a little bit more. I should probably pair this treatment with some counseling to help me adjust emotionally.

I rushed over to the woman and it was something I will never forget. Her right leg had been almost completely torn off from the groin and a fatty substance was spilling out of her body. She was somewhat conscious but in shock. Me and another woman kept telling her to open her eyes and look at the sky while two emts who happened to be driving by provided first aid.

Its interviews with people from all walks who have had difficult lives, addicts, gangsters, veterans, mobsters, sex workers etc most are traumatized and I suspect many have ptsd.

Anyways, one thing I've noticed is many of the people have this look in their eyes. They're intense, piercing but somewhat distant. It's like they contain pain, anger, resilience, strength, sincerity, longing and strange knowledge all at once. They look almost other worldly, beautiful and a little scary.

I saw a comment on another subreddit that just completely blew my mind about how true it is.,"It was something like “bullying is no different from domestic abuse. The only difference is that it’s between children.”

And I can’t begin to tell you how true that is. I was harshly bullied from ages 6-13, and I’m still discovering just how many repressed memories I have as well as the trauma that I’ve been keeping buried so deep resurfacing lately. Children might be children, but they are still capable of emotional, mental, and physical abuse. The trauma caused can be made even worse when there are no adults other than your one parent on your side either. 

I was so badly bullied, that my *own name* being used in an even remotely hostile/negative way is a trigger. *My name*. The worst part is, I love my name. I don’t ever want to change it. So I’ll just have to figure out how to deal I guess.

Would You Take a Pill that Wiped Away Fear-Based Memories?,">People with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) tend to have elevated levels of a biomarker called glucocorticoid receptor–FKBP51 protein complex. Fear-conditioned mice also have higher levels of the GR-FKBP51 protein complex.

At this stage, studies on targeting the GR-FKBP51 complex to treat or prevent PTSD are still in their early infancy.

I just need to tell someone,"TW: suicide attempt


My now wife attempted suicide 5 or so years ago by overdose. It was really serious. She was on life support for 9 days and then spent two more weeks in the ICU. 

I managed to get her to the hospital in time. I was with her in the ER. She was awake and talking fine and suddenly started seizing. They rushed me and her parents out of the room into this tiny private waiting area. We sat there waiting for hours. A doctor came in and said she might not make it through the night. She got put on life support. I practically lived at the ICU family room. I’ve been told I fell asleep leaning on her bed. Her kidneys started failing and her whole body swelled up. They said if she survived she probably wouldn’t be the same mentally. 

She managed to make a miraculous recovery. Like an actual miracle. But her recovery was hard to watch. When she woke up it seemed like she was empty. I watched a nurse feed her soup and her eyes were just blank. You’d ask a question and she’d just nod to anything she said. She wasn’t able to talk for a while. Slowly she got more and more like herself. After that she couldn’t walk. They aren’t quite sure what happened, maybe the seizure, but her leg is fucked up. There’s extensive nerve and tendon damage. She’s able to walk ok now but it’s painful and she limps. Sometimes she needs a brace and a cane depending on how bad it is. She lost all of her memory from the year prior. She can’t remember all the good times from then. She doesn’t remember me proposing.

She’s completely back to normal now aside from the leg and some memory issues. I love her with everything in me. She’s my world. But the thoughts keep creeping back. I can see all of these things clearly in my head. The seizure, the doctor saying she might not make it, the respirator, the soup, the blank stare, all of it. It terrifies me. I want it to stop.

Saw dad die,"Hi,

I think me and my mum both have trauma from an event about a month ago. My dad got covid 19, he went to bed one night with a flu and the following morning he deteriorated very quickly, I was awake with my mum watching over him and he stopped breathing, I pulled him into the floor off the bed as instructed by the emergency responder to begin CPR and he passed away literally in my arms. My mum was screaming, I continued the CPR until the paramedics came and they couldn’t save him. 

Since then during the days I’m ok, I’ve made good progress with the grieving and I’m helping my mum but at night I just can’t stop thinking about that night, the noises, the images they just replay in my head constantly and it’s often difficult to sleep. I’m 23 years old, I don’t know much about trauma / PTSD but I’m assuming this is similar.

"Does anyone else find being in nature profoundly calming, healing and refreshing?","I've been curious if anyone else has experienced this, and I would like to get feedback from not just nature lovers but those who aren't so bothered about nature either. So also If you aren't really a nature lover, if you have been in places like forests/woodlands or very wild/natural picturesque areas, have you nevertheless found any kind of healing or extreme calm simply by being in that environment? I tend to feel this strongly myself, though I know that I am a nature lover, so I'm curious if its just simply connected with my love of nature or whether it could be a universally healing thing independent of being a nature lover or not.

I suppose that because I have a lot of social anxiety, the remote nature of a lot of wild/nature environments give me a strong sense of peace and calm eventhough it is still ""outside"" and ""public"", and its very refreshing, like a reset button in some ways. I'm definitely not a ""new age"" type hippy person but I find it profoundly uplifting and calming. I know that some people have investigated what some have termed forest therapy or forest bathing.

People refusing to take responsibility for causing trauma,"I think someone refusing to even acknowledge that they caused you years of fucking grief, years of pain, years of feeling dead inside, years of panic... I think that’s more infuriating than having c/ptsd itself. 

My mom is a paranoid schizophrenic and emotionally and physically abused and neglected me and my brother and outright refuses to believe she was anything but a good mom. She’s literally said to me that she was a great mom and that /I/, the literal child, abused HER. When I reminded her how she threatened to kill me in my sleep and how she told my little brother she was gonna smash his head into the wall because he was being loud, she told me I was lying and that I made it all up. 

My foster parents gaslit me and my brother too, and they still stand by that they were the victims somehow even though CPS determined them to be neglectful too and took my brother out of their home (I’d already aged out). 

I had a situation happen to me earlier this year where I started dating a guy who seemed completely perfect for me, who wanted to be in a relationship, who was communicating and open and I’d let my defenses down and been emotionally vulnerable with him, let him be more affectionate with me than I’ve ever let anyone be... just to find out he had another girl he was seeing long term (4 years) and just never committed to her, but he was talking about adopting her kids, talking about marrying her, he even spent Valentine’s Day with the both of us..... and I didn’t even hear the news from him. SHE texted me at random and he denied it up and down but then kicked me to the curb with no explanation. She said really vicious, horrible things to me that triggered me for literal months. Now they’re in a relationship and apparently a happy one. I know it’s not healthy but I keep checking her stupid Facebook page. They’ve gotten a puppy, bunnies, she checks in when they go on dates and they go on dates all the time. I was just completely discarded, with no explanation, and now I have to watch how he chose this other chick who’s even an anti-masker and anti-vaxxer instead of me . 

I messaged him a few months ago and told him how much what he did to me made me spiral down and how much trauma it caused for me. And he somehow doesn’t think he did anything to hurt me. He acts like he did absolutely nothing and like I’m being crazy or something for being so distraught to find out that someone I got so vulnerable with just ripped the rug out from underneath me and was lying and manipulating me the entire time I was with them. I’ve never, ever in my life been triggered into trauma episodes every day for months before this happened. And he won’t even acknowledge that what he did was wrong.

Crazy neighbour doesn't beleive me about my child!!! TRIGGER WARNING!!!," 

**backstory: so, i was r\*p\*d when i was 13 by my step-dad, i got pregnant and i chose to keep the baby. i moved in with my girlfriend and her parents. I am now 16 and my son Logan is now 19 months. It was not my choice to have him, but it was my choice to keep him. and he is the best thing that has ever happened to me.**

**story: My girlfriend's parents (who I live with) moved into a house which is two 4 bedroom houses connected together by a small door downstairs. Me and my girlfriend live together in one of the houses, and her parents live in the other. in our house we each have our own bedrooms, but tend to sleep in the same room, with Logan. he has his room which is more of a playroom at the moment because he still sleeps in a cot in our room. my gf takes pride in the fact that she always keeps the house clean and loves to clean. also, we still technically live with her parents.**

**we have regular social services visits to make sure that we are all OK because we are so young, she is 16 as well. our neighbours (not her parents but the ones next to us on our side) are entitled parents. and this week came to our house about 10 minutes before a social service visit. they started screaming at us for having a child so young. i have extreme social anxiety and ptsd from when i got pregnant with him. I don't tell anyone that i don't trust completely about his father. so our neighbours don't know about the circumstances about him.**

**on this particular day she sees me and my gf playing with our son in the garden. he is only wearing his underwear because it is a hot day and he is in the pool. and he has plenty of sun-cream on. she comes knocking on my gfs parents door. her parents tell her that we live next-door not with them. she comes and knocks on our door and is shouting about how we shouldn't be living on our own, and we should have a responsible adult in the house. she then starts shouting about how we probably abuse Logan. she then asks how old i am and i tell her i'm 16, she slaps me and tells me that i am way too young to have a child and that i'm lying to her about him being my son. i tell her that he is my son and i was just young when i had him. she slaps me again and calls the police telling them that I've kidnapped a child. i start having a flashback because it was a very triggering situation. she then starts saying that our house is a mess. my gf was so angry but at this point is focusing on my more than the woman. then she sees my son and accuses us of sexually abusing him because he is only wearing his underwear! this is too much for me and i pass out because that can happen in ptsd. once I had come around and calmed down the woman started telling me i was overreacting. so i just turned around and told her the truth ""I WAS RAPED, I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO DO IT! IT WASN'T MY FAULT"" remember i'm 16 so this was a pretty scary situation for me in this moment. the crazy neighbour looks horrified and starts calling me all sorts of racial and religious slurred. ( which doesn't make sense because i am white french living in England!) also, i am still in my wheelchair because i was using it in the garden, so she kicks my wheelchair and breaks it!**

**i turn around and the social worker had seen it all. the social worker explained to them woman that i was a teen parent, and then the police arrested the crazy neighbour! social services took her kids off of her during the trial! i pressed chargers and she was fined. she did get her kids back but she never bothered us again after that. all is going well now and social services were very happy about how we handled the situation!**",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/gcn5e0/crazy_neighbour_doesnt_beleive_me_about_my_child/,PTSD

I finally figured out how my PTSD displays in my every day life and that I am NOT asymptomatic.,"So, recently I’ve been trying to work things out with my ex and he’s been pretty nasty to me at times and at one point he called me a sociopath because I still wanted to talk to him even though he told me I was disgusting and a whore and this and that. And after having abusive exes and an abusive mom and shit like that, my PTSD allows me to completely disassociate when people abuse me. I disassociate and compartmentalize without even realizing it. And it’s like I do this shit with my mom because I love her and I do it with him because I love him and I just have this understanding that if I love them and want them in my life I have to take the abuse for a little while. But, wow. It was an interesting realization.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/f4ujte/i_finally_figured_out_how_my_ptsd_displays_in_my/,PTSD
My dad is using my dead grandfather to guilt me into being polite to my violently sexually abusive brother over Christmas.,"My dad called me the other day to tell me some news, my molester brother was coming to Christmas with his partner and my Dad was wondering if I would be able to handle it ‘without making a scene’. ‘Everyone will be there including (sisters boyfriend)’. ‘It would mean a lot to mom to have all of her children under one roof.’ He continued, \*\*’before grandpa died he said, “all I want is peace in the family”, and that’s what I want.\*\*

My brother used violence to coerce me to commit sexual acts on him from the time i was 5-14 and he was 11-20. When I told my school guidance councillor she was mandated to report it and an investigation was initiated. On the morning of my first interview with the police my dad took me to breakfast at my favour restaurant in our small town, where he said, “you can either put your brother in jail, or you can keep the family together.” I lied to the police, told them I didn’t want to talk about it. The investigation went away. My parents never punished Nick, when the investigation was over they let him pick any city in the US and they would help him move there. He picked NYC. That was 11 years ago.

Ive kept my silence to keep the family together. My parents keep reminding me in our bi/trimonthly family fights that ‘there was nothing we could do.’ and \*\*‘there will be no more family if you keep up with this.’\*\*

My brother is always playing the saint and they just fawn over how success and accomplished he is. He’s seen as the darling helper who could do no wrong.

Whenever I try to talk to my family about what he did they tell me, ‘Tell your therapist that, not us.’

In my Mom and I’s most recent fights, she let out a tirade of ‘why didn’t you tell me it was happening? why didn’t you tell me one time?’ And then followed that up with, ‘When I was a little girl I prayed to God that I would have kids, but now after all of this I wish I Never was a Mom.’

I have been trying to go NC with my brother but my family doesn’t seem to respect that. I often get texts from him in the family group text saying overly positive shit like nothings up. He’s coming to Christmas, and my parents wanted me to go on a trip with everyone else including him and his girlfriend where I would be expected to ‘Not make a scene.’

I need some sort of grounding because I’ve been keeping quiet with this hell of family and rape for 21 years, first so my brother wouldent get in trouble, and secondly so my parents wouldent look bad to their family and friends.

The biggest hypocrisy of this is that I was sexually abused as a child by another perpetrator. A older man who abused me for 2 years concurrently with the time I was being abused at home. I told my mom what had happened, he then was charged and convicted and sentenced to jail. I had my parents full support then. I told my parents about this man abusing me in particular first so they would know how to handle my brother. Turns out they didn’t. I am still glad I told them in that order, because if I had told them about my brother and then the older man they would have covered up both, and I likely would have killed myself from the stress that I otherwise barely survived.

I miss my abuser so much. It makes me feel gross.,"I was trafficked as a child/young adult. Obviously, there were many people involved in this situation, but there was one man that was mostly in charge. I got news a couple of weeks ago that he died in prison. Everyone in my life feels like I should be happy or relieved about that, but I'm not happy at all. It's really.... painful. I feel like I'm in mourning over his death. 

I keep having dreams about all of the ""nice"" things he did for me. Handing me a glass of water. Allowing me to sit on the couch after a particularly violent encounter. Giving me a blanket to sleep with when I was really sick. I can't stop. I literally catch my brain thinking that this dude loved me and I'm really sad that I'll never be able to see him again. Which is probably the most fucked up thing I've ever thought in my life. Seriously. This man killed my daughter and essentially ruined my life, but my brain is somehow trying to convince me that he loved me???? It makes me nauseous that I could even think that, but somehow it creeps back in. 

I've told a couple people in my life about these feelings and everyone is like ""dude, that's fucked up. How??"". I don't know how?!? I'm crazy. I don't know. I guess i just wanted to share with some people who might understand. I am hoping these weird feelings pass quickly and never come back. Jesus.

I know practical things about electricity, woodworking, and simple engines (two-stroke tools)

Except of that I speak basic level Turkish, and I’m fluent in Hungarian, Slovak, Czech, English, and B1 in German. The rescue forces from all over Europe are in Hatay, I know about the Hungarian crew being deployed there, that’s my mother language. Common people don’t speak English there at all so I would offer my services as a translator.

I know I’m gonna see stuff. Please prepare me, how can I deal with it…

I hate the way PTSD has been oversimplified,"Sorry this really isn’t supposed to be mean, just a vent. Let me preface with saying that this isn’t about posts in this sub, more so just stuff I come across in various other outlets. And I don’t blame the individuals for this way of thinking, rather I think as a society need to be collectively better educated on mental health. But anyways…I hate how simplistic PTSD is viewed as at times. People will say something or post somewhere online being like, “I had a suspicious group of people bang on my windows a few weeks ago. I think I might have PTSD because now I get anxious every time I’m home alone.” (using an example of something that actually happened to me not someone else because I feel like that’d be unnecessarily mean, and no this isn’t what caused my PTSD lol). I feel sympathy for the person, I hope their anxiety heals soon and I know it’s not their intention or their fault but it just feels like being punched in the gut.

I feel like so many people have boiled PTSD down to an adverse reaction to something when it’s actually a multifaceted disorder. Also yes, trauma is subjective but there does need to be some real layer of threat there for it to even get to the level of it turning into PTSD. Like I can assure you, you don’t have PTSD from falling out with a friend (unless it was an abusive relationship or something). A degree of change is normal to an extent after a scary or unpleasant event.

I just feel like the disorder itself is a battle. Not sleeping, nightmares, anger…So it sucks when it gets oversimplified. It makes me scared people won’t take me seriously, either. Again, I don’t blame the people. I just feel frustrated with the misrepresentation of this disorder.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/10ezpkd/i_hate_the_way_ptsd_has_been_oversimplified/,PTSD

Has PTSD played a part in you walking away from God?,"I was raised in a ""Christian home"", and for many years I believed in the theology that I was taught from a young age. However, due to incidents that happened to me during my childhood and my adult life I found it put strain on my religious beliefs. They're not the only reason I turned away from God, as I've put myself into the agnostic category because of faults I've found with Christianity, as well as the idea of a personal God. But my personal reasons have nonetheless played a part in it. How could they not?

Even if there is a personal God (as in a God that cares about you and what you do, listens to your prayers, etc) I've found the idea of wanting to having a relationship with him to be (for lack of a better word) difficult. I have a friend who I sometimes talk to, and her advice usually goes something like this: 

\- God loves us. He will make something good out of all of this suffering.

\- God is good.

\- Trust. Believe. Keep the faith.

These phrases sound inspiring, but I find them to be shallow and simple. I think it's easy for a person who does well in life, or goes through something hard and comes out better for it to give thanks to God. But what about all of the people God doesn't help? Everyday, as I drive to or from work, I see homeless people sitting on the side of the road living in tents, I hear about people being raped and murdered on the news. I hear about people being kidnapped and being held for years against their will. I see greedy politicians on TV who are legally stealing from the citizens they are supposed to serve. I see war and disease. 

Perhaps I'm jaded, but I find this constant rat race we're in to be tiring. 

If there is a God, I find myself not wanting anything to do with him anymore. I don't want to worship him, I don't want to know him. At one time I may have. But I found him to be rather impersonal for a God who is supposedly personal. Where were you God? Where were you when I was being abused? Why didn't you stop it, or give me the strength to stop it on my own? And after each time, as the abuse happened over and over again, you expect me to come crawling back to you looking for love and protection and a relationship? I don't want to. I'm sorry God, but I don't love you. I don't love your creation. I don't want to be a part of it. I didn't ask for this. I have so much hate and disgust in me that I want nothing to do with you. And yes, I guess according to Christianity I may go to Hell for saying that. But you know what? When I die, I don't want an afterlife. I don't want your Heaven or your Hell.

How a PTSD attack works,"This is an educational post for those that think anxiety and trauma is cute and romanticize it. Read with care. 
TW: MENTIONS OF TRAUMA AND ABUSE

I’ve been sexually assaulted and psychologically abused by my parents. I’m triggered by sexual abuse (or mentions of it), mentions of trauma, people raising their voices at me, when people pretend to throw things at me or harm me, and loud noises (such as doors slamming, crowds, screaming and yelling). 

When I have an attack I hide myself in a ball and I cry with my hands in my ears to protect myself from the noise. If someone tries to touch me during an attack I scream and I harm people unintentionally. I shake, I go pale, my heart races, my memories go back, the flashbacks go even stronger, my paranoia goes insane, and I can’t move at all. 

It’s not cool. I’m not “cute UwU so anxious”. My social interactions are affected by this. I’m scared to get out of my house alone. I’m extremely paranoid and I always walk around with a weapon or something to defend myself. My life is hard. Don’t make it seem cute. I suffer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/egqmr5/how_a_ptsd_attack_works/,PTSD
I hate Christmas,"I will try and keep this short. I (30yof f) hate Christmas with a passion. When I was 12yo my alcoholic mother and step dad arrived home with my 4yo brother at 1am on Christmas day. I put him to bed and they were so drunk the inevitable fight broke out. I was in the living room wrapping my brothers presents because they hadn't bothered. 3 times I went into the kitchen to tell them to stop. The 4th time I walked in just before she picked up the knife and stabbed him. Punched his lung. I screamed and she followed me out of the room. A few mins later he was calling her back in. Our massive kitchen was covered in blood and she rushed him to the hospital. I didn't want my brother to wake up and see it so I cleaned it up. I was covered in blood. I hid the clothes, showered and waited. 
She came home and spent the next few hours telling me I would have to raise my brother because she was going to jail for murder. They lied to the police and made me lie to everyone in the family. I found out years later that they were aloud to tell people about it but me being a stupid kid never did. 
I have other mental health issues and this time of year brings it all back. The nightmares start in September when the Christmas crap starts appearing. I wish I could hide from the whole season. I don't know why I'm venting hear I just feel like shit!

My dad is trying to force me to re-traumatize myself bc he's too afraid to tell his wife the truth,"Trigger warning: CSA

My step brother molested me when I was 10 years old. We were on a family vacation and he snuck up on me in bed and messed with me.

I kept it a secret forever bc I was mortified. I tried to tell my older brother once, and he didn't say anything to anyone either so I gave up for a while. I eventually told my mom, who immediately told my dad by bitching him out. As far as I can recall, nothing came out of this either bc I was still forced to visit my dad every other weekend and still forced to be sleeping in the same house as this guy until I was 18. 

I definitely developed PTSD and never realized it most my life until I started going to therapy as a 30+ adult. This has caused me so much shame, guilt, re-traumatization, sleepless nights, relationship issues, suicidal thoughts, etc.. You guys know what I mean.

Fast forward to 2019, and I find out from my aunt that my dad is intending to have my step brother over for our family gathering to celebrate my dad and my Nana's bdays (mind you, the rest of the family don't like him either for various reasons like him calling my brother fat and other charming things like that) so I called my dad and let him know how that makes me feel and how I can't be around that guy ever again. Didn't work, had to see the guy, sucked ass for me, etc.

Fast forward to Father's day last night. We're at dinner, and my dad brings up the topic. We're about to have our family gathering for dad/Nana's bday again in a couple of weeks. Dad wants to know how we can ""resolve this."" I tell him that I WON'T be in the same place as my step brother anymore, and that if he intends on having him there, I won't be going. My dad spins a sad tale about how my step brother is getting divorced and only gets to see the kids at certain times and blah blah blah. Basically, he knows his wife wants to have my step bro over that weekend, and he wants to know how he can make it as comfortable as possible for himself. I was under the impression that he told his wife about it in 2019 bc she was in the fucking background, but apparently not and now he's asking me to tell her. 

So now, my father has set me up to re-traumatize myself by telling my story again to my step mother (who has shown support for public figures having allegations against them and blamed victims) about what her son did to me. He was nice enough (sarcasm) to prepare me by saying ""I really don't know what she's going to say to you, she might blow up."" 

If I don't tell her, then my step bro will most certainly be at the party, and I'll either need to be around him again or miss one of my favorite events bc my out of town family will be here to visit.

Thanks for anyone who made it this far.. would definitely be open to any advice if anyone has any.... 😭

**EDIT:** Wow. I am so floored and so appreciative of everyone's nice words and encouragement. I really needed to hear them because when I'm around him, I tend to cower and let him get away with murder. IDK why I am still so scared to really unleash on him.. he certainly hasn't been afraid to make me feel like shit.

Here's a fun (sarcasm) little comment I received yesterday morning too: ""don't try and tell [step mom] today, we found another leak in our roof this morning so things are really hectic around here.""

Stopped a Panic Artack in its tracks!,"I was at the dentist office with my son, and a very angry man came in to complain to the management.  A petite woman came out to talk to this tall guy, and he kept shutting her down - cutting her off, interrupting, raising his voice.

You’re triggering my PTSD from working with the Army, and I would really appreciate it if your could bring yoir volume down a bit too please.”

After that, the office lady came to escort him into an office - and asked if I would like to go into one when he loudly refused too.  She could tell I was shook.  I decided to go Outside instead.  Then I decided to LEAN INTO the panic attack (I was crying and shaking and it was hard to breathe).  I just started a YouTube channel on talking openly about mental
Health issues and how I deal with my conditions as naturally as possible.  So I got my phone out and FILMED my Panic Attack - and how I was able to calm Myself down.  

And it worked!  I got out my essential oils and worry stone and did deep breathing and practiced gratitude.  My panic attack went away, and I was able to go back into the office and not feel like a complete loser for losing my shit in there.  I even shared my Yoitube info and had a great chat with the office staff about mental health awareness.  It was a really awesome way to end what could have been a really horrible visit!

Bystanders make me more angry than my attacker,"I seriously don’t understand why people never do anything to help you unless you ask them to. Why do people specifically go out of their way to do nothing when they witness someone being abused? 

I was hurt by my ex boyfriend a few years ago and now I have to deal with this ptsd and while he goes through like just fine. 

Although he makes me angry for what he did the people who sat and watched him to things to me make me more angry. I have so much hatred for everyone and everything because I can’t trust anyone and people are so unreliable. 

Not even at my possible death will someone come to save me. I’m so glad I don’t remember the faces of who witnessed it because I swear I would go berserk. I have never felt such rage for people in my life and even though it’s bad for me to say I hope those people suffer including my ex boyfriend.

I don’t even care for the excuse that they were too scared to speak up. They had a choice and they made the wrong one.

Family makes fun of my triggers,"I grew up with an alcoholic and drug addicted father. He was never physically abusive towards me but I've had a lot of traumatic experiences of him high out of his mind,  driving drunk,  having a psychotic episode,  slamming things,  etc.

One of my triggers is when my family is heavily under the influence. If they're just tipsy it's fine but if they start acting delirious then I get really anxious. Anyway, last year my mom decided she wanted to try an edible (weed). My brother told her to eat a whole cookie. I was begging her to only take a piece of it (300mg cookie!!).

Anyways she took it and my brother went off to a party so I was home alone with my mom, who of course got insanely high. She was basically stoned on the couch speaking nonsense to herself and her mouth was so dry, her eyes were so red etc. In a certain way this image is funny, and that's how my mom and my brother see it.

But that day I was extremely triggered by the sight, and I cried for a long time. My mom and brother still tell the story of how I started crying because she ate an edible even though I explained to them its my ptsd. It's like they don't understand how real it is at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/k78x89/family_makes_fun_of_my_triggers/,PTSD

I was raped in a fucking hospital.,"I only ever tell this story in two different halves.

The first half is about how I ended up in the hospital. I almost died. I experienced what it's like to know that you're about to die, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. 

0/10. Would not recommend.

The second half is about what I woke up to a day later. In the dim night, when everyone else was gone. Having to limp out of the hospital in pain. Remembering hands, and the other person, and the giddy-with-insanity-as-it-broke-my-brain realization that nobody was going to come and save me. That this was just going to happen. Trying to sit up. Being pushed back down. Passing back out.

I was 18.

Some completely pulverized piece of me will never accept that this actually happened. What goes hand in hand with that is the irrational, unshakeable certainty that nobody will ever believe me. Despite that already not being true.

At first, I told myself it was because hospitals had to have cameras in those rooms. This couldn't have happened. Then I told myself that my parents would've been there overnight.

Neither of that's true.

And the risk of false memory syndrome doesn't explain the pain.

Or the fact that a serial rapist who worked around that hospital went on trial less than 2 years later, and he looked like every shard of memory that I have.

It's many years later, now. 

Things are usually better than this.

But it's a month from the time this happened, and I'm drinking tonight. A lot. And I just want to say it. The truth. To someone besides my wife.

*This happened.*

Even though the chances of it happening were infinitesimal. 

Statistically, false memory syndrome is infinitely more likely.

But false memories don't leave you checking for blood because you're in so much fucking goddamn pain that you're shaking at having to use the fucking bathroom.

I don't know what anyone can say back to this. I don't know what there is to say. 

*I* don't know what to say about it.

How could you?

The next time I woke up, it was the most beautiful day you've ever seen in your life. There was a huge window in the room, and a phenomenal view of the city and the rolling hills.

Now I have to put up blackout curtains on beautiful springtime days. Because the sunlight is radioactive. It makes me start throwing up before I realize why I'm sick. Every tired fucking year. Despite meds that do help, and therapists who've never been worth a damn.

I stood at that window, just staring out of it. Pathologically docile. I said yes to everyone. I told them everything they wanted to hear. I was human putty, spineless and soft.

Because all I could think was ""I want to go home.""

*Please, let me go home. Please, I need a shower. I feel disgusting. Everything feels disgusting. Please don't force me to stay here.*

When I finally finished jumping through hoops, and went home? 

They guilted me for the cost of the ambulance they'd called to save my life.

I went upstairs. I finally got to take a shower. 

And as soon as I got into it, all I could do was cry.

No, I'm not stable right now. Yes, I'm weird and broken and pathetic.

But you know what? If anyone else had to live through this shit, along with everything that came before it, and everything that came after it? They would be too.

I'm tired of being ashamed and embarrassed about the completely unwanted, uninvited effects of having had to survive more in two days than some people survive in their entire fucking lives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/119ui9v/i_was_raped_in_a_fucking_hospital/,PTSD
DAE feel that the PTSD is far worse than the event(s) that caused it?,"I just don’t know how people live with ptsd.

I was passionate about so many things it was hard to keep in in bed for more than a few hours each night. 
Now everything is a massive effort for no joy.

Did you lose pleasure in your hobbies?,"I was diagnosed with chronic PTSD a few months ago that's manifested since my adolescence. I've always had a really restricted range of activities that I enjoyed doing, but I've noticed lately that I'm losing interest in everything I used to enjoy. 

First, I stopped watching television.... Then, art wasn't fun anymore. I stopped writing for leisure... Photography....  

I used to enjoy driving around in my car and just listening to music, and meditating..... I have absolutely no desire to do that now because *I don't even enjoy music* ?! 

Wtf WHO doesn't enjoy music..... 

Everything that was pleasurable, from friendships, to (sorry... TMI) sex & masturbation, to eating nice food.... It's like, I'm an empty shell of a human carcass. I don't really feel *anything*.

A lesson from someone who lost their battle to PTSD.,"Hello. I was diagnosed officially I think a few months ago, probably actually had it for longer. My trauma stemmed from a relationship, but that’s not important. I took literally all the wrong routes on the road to recovery. I’m at the end of my road now. I’m fresh out of energy. Hurt. Hopeless. My only solace is since I screwed up an extreme amount, I can impart a lot of knowledge on to others. 

First, stay the fuck away from drugs. Especially the ones people tell you to , you know, stay away from. They’ll make you feel great, amazing. Then you’ll need them to function. Life without them will be so, so dull. It’s like having a heavy suitcase you never knew you was carrying taken away from you. Just... don’t. Please.

Second, never, ever RELY on one person. I did. Said they’d be there for me while I healed. Said they’d love me. Said they’d even help me get comfortable back on my campus. They ghosted around 4 days ago. A friend shown me their Tinder today. Of course, accept help. Love. Live life. But relying on someone like that, EXPECTING them to always be there, is a disaster. You need to be fully capable of being alone. I have no idea how to do this 

Third, keep trying meds. Switch therapists if it calls for it. Try, try, try. Misery is such an easy thing to get comfortable with. Keep moving. Always improve.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/ion88q/a_lesson_from_someone_who_lost_their_battle_to/,PTSD
"Was diagnosed with PTSD as a teenager, never really took the diagnosis seriously until now as a young adult. Anyone else unable to remember the majority of their childhood?","I just, can’t remember it. I know it happened obviously, but I have very scattered memories just kinda sprinkled throughout ages. I remember practically nothing from up to around age 8. One really horrific memory from around 8 or 9. Then scattered blips of memories till around 16. And then  a couple more fully formed memories from 16-18, where I can distinctly remember how I felt and most of what happened. But still can’t remember the majority of all of it. I mostly remember things from age 19 to now, where I was out of the trauma itself and on my own. And a lot of it isn’t even remotely happy, but I remember pretty much all of it.

Is this normal or is it part of the ptsd? I didn’t even remember I was diagnosed with ptsd until around a month ago, when I realized what’s been happening to me is flashbacks. I wish the therapist I’d seen when I was little would have helped me with it, since now I feel like I’ve blocked everything out.

"I have episodes where if someone touches me, even my SO, I have a mini panic attack. Can anyone relate?","I haven’t been able to find much information about this online, so I’m reaching out to this community. I have sexual trauma from a couple years ago and it has been getting worse recently. 

One of the worst symptoms is that when my boyfriend touches me I just can’t handle it sometimes. It doesn’t even have to be in a sexual way - even if we’re just cuddling, I’ll suddenly become aware of his hands on me and I have this feeling that’s hard to describe. It’s an awful combination of disgust and anger. 

I can still feel it after he stops and moves away from me, and it makes me want to rip my skin off in that area. It makes me feel bad because he’s always respectful of my boundaries and I trust him completely, but these episodes still happen randomly. 

Sometimes they last for a full day after it happens, and it’s hard for me to even take a shower because being naked makes me uncomfortable. Even if it’s just me by myself. I have obsessive thoughts about the trauma that are so vivid I can almost feel it happening again. 

I feel really weird about it, and the fact that I haven’t been able to find anything online makes me feel worse. Can anyone relate? Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/enbnf0/i_have_episodes_where_if_someone_touches_me_even/,PTSD

5. even if you HAD made a mistake or done something you wish you hadn't, you aren't a bad person. that is just being a normal person.

6. you can't protect everyone, can't fix everyone, don't 'deserve' horrible things having had happened to you, didn't ask for it, aren't a villain, don't even need 'forgiveness'.

ls anyone else uncomfortable with how society glorifies serial killers?,"I want to have a genuine discussion here, as I'm seeing two sides of something. I have several close friends who are deeply interested in serial killers and true crime. They even have “favorite” serial killers. Now, I’m open to the idea that the psychology behind why people commit crimes could be fascinating. 

However, I find it disgusting when people are buying clothing with pictures of serial killers on it. It’s not edgy or quirky. It’s glorifying them. They are NOT celebrities and the only acceptable place for their faces is on the bottom of your shoe. 

As someone who was the victim of a violent crime-as someone who truly believed I was going to be killed by my rapist (a stranger whom I trusted to help me, who held me captive overnight) I can’t stand how people romanticize violent people like Ted Bundy, Ed Kemper, and Brian Laundrie right now. Murder, rapes, attacks, and the investigations that follow are messy, gritty, and sad. 

True crime treats the victims of trauma like characters in a story. Imagine if your trauma, or abuser, or rapist, was glorified. Victims are eventually reduced down to names and ages. The offender gets some sort of sick celebrity status and a movie deal on Netflix 

I just think it’s so unfair to the victims who are no longer living, to the family of victims, and to future victims of abuse, rape, and murder.

Wife’s ptsd,"Nothing is harder than loving a woman that’s been beat down by a man. 
These men have destroyed every single ounce of confidence this woman ever had. She doubts herself constantly. I can hardly even lift a hand without her flinching from the abuse. Any instance that I seem irritated, she automatically assumes it’s her fault. I hate it for her so much. 
Not to mention the whole time she was with the most recent, all her past traumas from her childhood, he told her wasn’t viable reasons to claim she had ptsd. In his opinion unless you’re a veteran you don’t know what ptsd is. He constantly reminded her that she was nothing and would be nothing. Yet he was the one who couldn’t pay bills and needed to utilize every single outlet he could, simply because he didn’t want to work.

But on Saturday we went to this sandwich place called Firehouse subs and for some unknown reason they sandwich place was playing videos over and over of what firemen do and how great they are but the video kept talking about accidents and fires and how in one crash 2 people died but that the person was so thankful for the firefighters who helped 
 It kept playing sirens over and over and at the same time my in-laws were talking about a crash they saw last week .

And out of no where my 7 year old starts screaming and saying she’s really scared and the sirens are scaring her and wanted me to make it stop :( she wouldn’t calm down. I was already getting triggered as well but didn’t want to make a scene 
I gave my daughter my headphones and let her watch bluey and she started to calm down .
When we got home she told me how scared the sounds made her feel and that she just remembers the accident and how scary it was . And she kept seeing the accident :( ! I feel TERRIBLE she had never brought up these feelings till now . 

I want to call her and see what they think but I also don’t want to make her talk about it if it will trigger her more . This is so confusing to me especially since she’s just a kid :( idk how to handle it 

I do remember when I would pick her up from school and if j was even a tiny bit late due to traffic she would be crying and telling me she thought I crashed again and died :( ! But now j work at her school so she always knows where I am . And I thought that would be enough to feel better :( but I just never seen a child so triggered!

I fell apart at work and now my coworkers are gossiping about me.,"I’m so overwhelmed. Last week, the flashbacks were so bad the night before my shift (I’m a server) that I was awake all night, and I wasn’t able to call in. Needless to say, I was not in a good head space. Of course, that one day in particular was absolutely CRAZY at the restaurant, and I was struggling to keep up. 

My coworker asked me why I was so overwhelmed, and said that I should have been handling this better. So I, not wanting to divulge my whole mental health history, just joked that I must have partied too hard last night. I thought I made it clear that I was kidding, but I guess not, because she started spreading it around that I wasn’t able to perform my job and that I was falling apart. When my supervisor came to talk to me, I broke down crying and explained what happened. Now the coworker is accusing me of lying, and I heard her and some other girls talking about how I’m incompetent at my job. 

I can’t do this anymore. I understand making a hangover joke was probably in poor taste, but considering we’re all college kids, I thought it would go better than explaining the real reason. Just feel super demoralized and I hate myself for it. Why did I have to fall apart at work?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/cptxgo/i_fell_apart_at_work_and_now_my_coworkers_are/,PTSD
I disclosed,"

Wednesday evening I had a guy I’ve been seeing the last month or so come over to my place. We’d slept together before, and I’d already felt relatively safe, but this time I got triggered. I don’t know why, maybe it was the stress, but when he bit my leg (something I usually enjoy) I triggered, and I started flailing and kicking, then rolled over on my side and covered my face. He was gentle and checked on me and I apologized, and he pulled me in to cuddle. After I calmed down a bit, I said something about how we should talk about it, he said that we didn’t have to. 

I don’t disclose. I was in denial of my rapes and abuse for years, and when it all came out I told my boyfriend at the time. We’d been together for years, we lived together, I completely believed that he was going to be supportive. Instead he verbally abused me for hours, told me I was a slut and a liar and other horrible things. I have struggled with disclosure ever since, and have missed out on potential relationships because my fear of disclosing makes me disconnected and withdrawn. Disclosure is a huge barrier for me. 

But I disclosed. I had to work myself up to it, and he was patient. He already knew I had ptsd, so I said “my ptsd comes from sexual assault and domestic violence.” I talked a little about it and explained my reaction. I had to work myself up to it, but I did it. I was still very activated so I put on music and told him we should talk about other things to distract me, so he let me show him all my gemstones I recently got. He literally listened to me talk about rocks. I managed to pull myself back and finish having sex with him, and he was gentle even though I knew it wasn’t his preference. I kept apologizing to him about everything that happened and he told me it was okay, and to stop apologizing. 

This is a huge event for me. Disclosure to a sexual partner has never been successful for me. Most of the time it doesn’t happen. Potential relationships have been impaired by my avoidance. Disclosure itself carries trauma for me. I’ve been talking in therapy about how to disclose for years. So this is a big deal for me. And I’m proud of me. I hope that this means I’ll start being able to have this discussion with more serious romantic partners and I’ll stop ruining relationships.

Is there a job that ONLY women can do?,"I know it sounds strange and I'm embarrassed...

I'm also currently in a psychiatric ward for other reasons - but you could include that one in.

But I know that I need a job. And I don't see myself in a job with men in the near future. I can't. I can work on it now and maybe have longer conversations later, but work... at least now - I just can't.

"Tomorrow is the 16th anniversary of the worst game of Hide and Seek I’ve ever played. (T.w. Child abuse, animal abuse)","March 16th, also known as the anniversary of when I got my last D on a report card. 

WARNING: This gets really dark really fast, so the faint of heart should turn back. 

*My dad was a bit of a drinker.*

I was in third grade. I was a bit of trouble child (mostly a slacker) in school. Not at home. God forbid. I hid my report card and he found it. On his birthday. My sister told me he found it so I hid outside. Big mistake. 

Worst hide and seek game ever. He came outside with his shotgun. He went to my pet rooster, who shares my very rare name, and shot his head off. “The mutt is next if you don’t get your ass out here!” I continued to watch from my spot in the bush. My dog was indeed next. I cried out and he found me. He chased me across the yard and tackled me. 

After carrying me inside by  the back of my neck, he broke my nose on a wall. Blood spouted from my nose, down the pale yellow wallpaper, and seeped into the carpet. Told me I’m a failure. Shoved my bloody nose back into the wall and brought out “The Slapper,” a leather belt he carved up and kept in a bucket of water; you know, for these special occasions. He made me stand with my arms out, moving them up and down. For three hours. “If I could do this in football practice you can do it now!” 

(Yeah, that high school you dropped out of in 10th grade?) 

Periodically he’d come over and tire his arm out with that belt. Blood covered me. My face, my spiderman shirt, my blue shorts, socks. But the back was the worst. He didn’t go for my ass. Lacerations covered my tiny back. Blood slicked the back of my shirt and shorts. I still have the scars. 

(I *used* to be reminded every time I look in the mirror. I’ve healed enough now to see myself as who I truly am and not the helpless, abhorrent, bastard abomination they tried to mold me into.) 

After I missed dinner and said I was hungry, he threw my rooster’s head at me and told me to eat it if I was really that hungry. I wasn’t. 

He made me clean the blood until I passed out at 3am. The next day, he cooked my favorite meal, took me fishing, and bought me an RC car; unheard of. 



So yeah, that’s a bit much for… what a seven year old? 

That anniversary is tomorrow. 

I’ve missed almost a week of work and have ignored all my responsibilities. Outwardly I seem fine and happy and enjoying our new puppy. But inside idk how I feel. It’s a mix of “why tf can’t I have a decent family” and “why tf do people keep treating me like shit.” Anger, humiliation, deep sadness, self disgust, and negative self talk have inhabited my brain while I sit and play Skyrim for hours on end. I’ve had night terrors for the past week as well. 

I told my fiancé the whole story today. She held me tightly afterwards and we sobbed together. She noticed that I still blame myself. “I should have done better in school.” “If I came out of my hiding place I could have saved my dog.” Sounds absurd hearing it aloud. My father was a deranged maniac, none of that was my fault. He killed other pets of mine, it was inevitable. I never deserved this. 

She suggested that we both write letters to our younger selves, and no matter how painful or uncomfortable, we will share them with each other. I might share mine on here later, who knows. 

I love this woman to death. She’s a ride or die kinda gal and she’s always had my back. I’m going to marry her ass so hard. 



Post Script: 
To give some people a sense of relief: I was saved when I was in fourth grade. Adopted into a semi-functional family. This certainly wasn’t the only event in my childhood, but through therapy and meds, I have healed immensely. Additionally, I have a great support system.

My husband is triggering trauma responses and refuses to attend marriage counseling to work on things. How can I work on things?,"I, 26f, have been together with my husband, 31m, for about 4 years and married for 1. In the year we have been married, it has felt like a steady decline in our relationship. We have been fighting to an increasing degree to where I sometimes dread coming home. 

Most of my grievances come from feeling that my boundaries are not being respected. I am a survivor of childhood abuse and sexual assault, so physical intimacy can be very challenging for me, especially if I don't feel my boundaries are being respected. My husband has stated that he views my trauma responses as me being ""cold and frigid"" and that I just need to ""suck it up and get over it"".

What I don't understand is that he never complained about how affectionate I am before we got married and I never changed my habits. After months of him telling me I am never affectionate, I started tracking how often I am affectionate each day and made an effort to be more affectionate. When we got into another argument about it and he made the statement that I am ""never"" affectionate once again, I pointed out how often I am affectionate, and the efforts I have made to increase this. He stated that it wasn't good enough and that it should just be whenever he wants the attention and affection, as he views this as my duty as his wife.

He is very forceful and confrontational when he seeks any kind of affection, and while I try not to make him feel rejected, the way he forces himself on me is very hard for me to handle when it causes so much stress, anxiety and traumatic flash backs. He was never like this before we got married. And he knew from the beginning that I struggled with PTSD. I never hid it from him. Now, sometimes it almost feels like he's trying to provoke this kind of reaction from me.

I have tried to communicate how I feel in non confrontational ways and explain to him the logical reasons for my reactions when he violates my boundaries, however my husband refuses to acknowledge any accountability for his words and actions. I have asked him several times over the last few months to go to marriage counseling with me so we can work on our marriage, however, he adamantly refuses. 

My husband has flat out told me that he believes that he has never done anything wrong and that if I find any issue in our marriage it is my problem. That our arguments are solely my fault, and that I need to ""get over"" my ""issues"" and ""get on some meds"". 

I'm honestly at a loss at this point and I feel devastated and ashamed that my marriage has fallen to this point. I've only confided in one close friend about all of this, but they're at as much of a loss for what to do as I am. I couldn’t bear the shame and embarrassment of getting a divorce. My husband is all I have since my family disowned me for marrying him, but I don't know how much longer I can live this way. I've started to reach a point where I just don't know how I feel about him anymore. What do I do to work on things when he won't go to marriage counseling? 


TL,DR: My husband will not respect my boundaries and insists that in spite of the constant fighting we do not need marriage counseling because the only problem with our marriage is me. How do I work on repairing our marriage when he won't participate in counseling?

Edit 1: Thank you everyone for the responses. I appreciate the advice. I would like to clarify, as I've seen a lot of replies encouraging me to get back in contact qith my family, that it's not an option. My mother is a narcissistic abuser who was abusive to me my entire life and is a big reason I struggle with CPTSD. I had to cut contact after she began harassing me for marrying my husband as she is a racist and does not approve of his race. It never had anything to do with how my husband treats me.

Is it possible to forget a trauma experience but have PTSD?,"Just as the title says. To preface, I AM diagnosed with PTSD and do have a set of trauma experiences I can recall vividly and experience PTSD symptoms around, but I keep feeling this bugging feeling that something in my early childhood has been extremely traumatic and that I have yet to remember it/can’t remember it.

Has anyone experienced this? Does it come back to you eventually? Is it better forgotten? If it’s forgotten but the feeling is there, do I tell my therapist?

I lost my femininity,"Tw - sexual assault

Ever since my rape I have been slowly losing my femininity. It's been just over a year (it happened December 2018) and I just realized how truly painful it is for me to wear or do anything remotely feminine. I was dressed up for a night out with friends and I had to fo home from the hospital in a pair of scrubs because my clothes got ripped off.

Ever since then, I've lost my passion for makeup, which I was planning to make a career out of. I stopped dressing up, stopped wearing skin tight clothes, stopped wearing dresses or any other kind of girly clothes. I cut all my hair off and now I feel uncomfortable buying women's underwear. I have to buy men's underwear and order sports bras designed for trans people to help constrict my chest.

I have panic attacks when I go shopping, when I do makeup, and I have cancelled plans to go out with friends over the fact that I can't bring myself to get dressed up and I don't wanna show up in sweat pants again.

I dont really know what I'm looking for by posting here, maybe just to know I'm not alone? I hate that I lost such a big part of myself. I loved being girly and now I feel uncomfortable even wearing shirts with scoop necks.

It feels so stupid and trivial, I know, but I just kinda needed to put this somewhere out there.

Edit - wow thank you so much for the love and support. Your kind words have really helped lift me today.

For example, if I’m parked I’ll watch my mirrors looking for any type of danger. Or if fire works go off I hit the floor thinking it’s a gun going off. What I’m getting at is, I’m in a relationship and it’s great I love my girl, but she doesn’t understand why I’m so silent and why I don’t communicate. It’s so hard for me to do these things. Then she gets mad at me and I repeatedly tell her that the things I’ve been through has lead me to be silent because I felt weak. Like she grew up with both her parents in the suburbs, sheltering her, loving her, teaching her to communicate her feelings. I couldn’t even get a look from my mother as a child, and my father was never around. So I grew up alone and traumatized.

You are like the perfect woman to me. I don't have to explain a thing, you already get it. People with traumatic childhoods speak a common language. We have similar issues to deal with, maybe even the same triggers. I have been with ""normal"" women. Never again. They are belittling and cruel. You my type and I cannot be alone in this. 1 in 4 girls. 1 in 5 boys. That's millions of people.

Topic title:
> [TW Sexual Abuse] Would you date/be interested in a girl that had been sexually abused as a young child?

Apparently he exclusively dates sexual abuse survivors because they can """"relate"""" to him. Only they also have to be half his age, because he fetishizes age gaps. Oh, and he prefers chubby women because they're ""more giving with themselves"", and ""more willing"". (Don't worry, we'll get to the lovely comments about that!)

Seems *legit.*

That whole suspiciously-enthusiastic, unprovoked, very r/SelfAwareWolves Not A Perv I Swear speech is because multiple people confronted him yesterday-ish about this. He's in full defense mode. Dude sure does like his ""my creepy sexual preferences are all because of PTSD, so I shouldn't have to worry about whether I'm hurting anyone else with them"" excuses.

Normal women are so bitter and cruel...lol. They call him creepy just for wanting to jack off to your sexual abuse, guys. :( This poor victim. There must be a conspiracy among all the woman who aren't half his age and so broken that he seems normal and safe for longer than 30 seconds. Yeah, that must be it.

He gets one creeped-out reply. As with every other comment from someone he creeps out, he immediately ghosts the conversation. Perhaps because he's had this conversation quite often *(for some mysterious reason)* and already knows how it's going to go, and he just doesn't care? 

But that's just my best guess at interpreting complete silence from someone who has had no counterargument to ""wtf this is predatory"" besides ""I have PTSD and I'm immature so I've decided it's okay. Anyways, why am I all alone? It's so sad how *""""""normal""""""* women can't stand me, even tho I'll never post a specific example because people sure do always agree with the womens' concerns whenever I do.""

[Here's him beelining to a topic posted by a virgin to give creepy, lurid ""advice"" that's really just him fantasizing about the situation.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lg9i7f/first_time_with_a_girl_and_im_freaking_out/gmq4txw/)
-------------------
> Be cool. You guys are smack in the middle of that amazing young, lusty, passionate, mind-blowing sex phase that makes life worth living. Just go with it and try not to over-think the situation. Instead of panic about how you might fuck it all up in the future, live in the moment. Appreciate the fact that this girl is super into you right now. Nothing lasts forever, especially not these white-hot hookups. That doesn't mean they aren't worthwhile. Have high hopes but keep expectations low. Also, form your own opinions of people. That shade about her being impulsive and emotionally unavailable has little to do with your current situation. That's the past. People can stop being impulsive and unavailable when they enter into a more appealing relationship. It's possible. So, take it as it comes. And if in the end it falls apart, at least you got to experience that passion. A lot of people are too boring and too careful to even allow themselves this pleasure. Let it do what it do.

[Here's him reviewing womens' bodies. This isn't inherently bannable, but it is so fucking gross. You creepy fuck.](https://np.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/lhaqaa/people_who_like_chubby_girls_what_is_it_that/gmw9r1g/)
-------------------
> Skinny girls are okay to look at (sort of) because of the way clothing fits them. Fashionable Western clothing styles are usually fitted to be worn by lean women. I don't subscribe to these standards. I like thick women. It's disapointing when a great beauty has no ass on her. That beautiful, big ass on a chubby woman is only part of it, though.

> Skinny women are bony af. Ever lay with a skinny chick? She's all elbows and knee caps. Sometimes a woman is so petite I feel like I might break her on accident. A chubby woman is much softer, and to me, much more pleaseant to lay with. Simply put, they feel better to me. There's one more societal reason guys dig the chubby women of the world.

> They try harder. A thin woman who grew up skinny has never known the ridicule that fat women endure. A woman who's been told her whole life that she's ""hot"" will assume her mere physical presence is enough. I find skinny women are sometimes a bit full of themselves, especially if they're also blonde. Maybe it's just where I grew up, idk? A chubby woman who isn't accustomed to these platitudes and accolades isn't so full of herself. She's typically nicer, more generous with herself, and a more willing partner. It's the same for men, too. People who're told over and over they're the embodiment of some highly desirable feature mistakenly think it's all they need to bring when it comes to relations. Chubby women don't usually fall into that trap. Mad love for the chubs!

Hey look, ***he targets women who ""try harder"" and are ""more willing"" (because they have presumed low self-esteem).***

Oh sure, this poor little victim has noooo predatory motivations when he targets young sexually-abused women. He just wants someone who understaaaaaands him.

Sure, buddy.

[Here's him victim-blaming someone in this sub for daring to expect men on dating apps to not be emotionally abusive, because ""let's be real"", ~~boys will be boys~~ men are just like that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lfpznk/dating_is_exhausting_tw_sex/gmnd5u7/)
-------------------
> I think you're really good at making excuses for why you cannot do things. Let's be honest here. Many guys are gonna be emtionally abusive regardless of your status as a survivor. What your comment says is you're still filled with lots of trepidation and feelings of unsafe vulnerability. Finding a match is an act of vulnerability. You might be excluding a lot of potentially good matches simply becuase you aren't ready to be vulnerable. It happens. We want recovery to occur quicker than it does and feel impatient we,'re not ""where we should be"". I get the deep lonliness. Remember I said I've had some success on reddit? I have been living in crazy, PTSD induced isolation, waiting 30+ years to find a woman like this. She's a survivor. She gets me. Talk to me in 2050 about your lonliness

Let me set aside a sec to wtf at ""my loneliness is so much worse than urs, OP, let me flex about that real quick"" but at this point, that's just a drop in the bucket.

[Oh and this guy, who - remember! - exclusively dates sexually-abused women, actively targets 'teens' in the ""age gap personals"" subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lfpznk/dating_is_exhausting_tw_sex/gmn89ls/)
--------------------
> B) I have great success finding like-minded peeps here on reddit. There are tons of subreddits for dating. Because of severe trauma and PTSD I ***[48 M]*** am kinda trapped in the mind of a teen, so I've used the ""Age Gap Personals"" sub to find women closer to my mental age. You may want to skew your dating search older as a more mature man will (hopefully) not act like such fuck boi. Obviously, anything on reddit has the potential to turn into a gutter.

Gee, I wondered where all the refugees from r/jailbait went! 

Dude just *loves* the obvious pedo-magnet community that inevitably only survives because they insist you lie and say you're 18. I'm not clicking in there, but let me guess: the vast majority of the population is old looking for young. 

What a chickenhawk coop. Let's play a game: guess how many IPs in there are coming from prisons, or the residences of known sex offenders? 

[Oh, and OP should fix her post-sexual-abuse dating problems....by not just lowering her standards, but dating older men ***and*** advertising her abuse to them on dating sites more often.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lfpznk/dating_is_exhausting_tw_sex/gmn89ls/)
-------------------
> C) whatever you do, I strongly advise you to disclose your situation i.e. recovering from sexual assault but tryna get back into dating. The honesty will attract the kind of sensitive, emotionally mature men you're looking for.

**He is literally targeting people** ***in this subreddit*** **and trying to convince them to heal from their sexual violence** ***by ""dating"" guys like him.*** 

And he refuses to even *acknowledge* the multiple power imbalances he clearly gets off on. 

Chubby women is his most legal kink. He doesn't say a single thing about their bodies that he likes, because he doesn't like them: he just looks down on them, and hopes they'll be too desperate and insecure to object to his glaring flaws.

Problem is, adult fat women often don't actually *want* to be with grimy assholes who expect them to abide by an unspoken rule of ""you're fat and worth less, so you should be grateful I even want to fuck you, and not have any standards for me to meet"". 

Just because *he* doesn't value them doesn't mean they're actually going to ""try harder"" - aka, ignore that he's a restraining order waiting to happen, that he likes em young, and that he talks about women like fuckable cattle. 

(And whatever else is horrible behind the scenes that can't be gleaned from literally just his public Reddit activity over the last day or so.)

Guess he's had more luck with sexually-abused teenagers.

Ban. 

Him.

I'm not going back farther in his post history. If this isn't enough, staff just doesn't give a fuck.

PTSD doesn't induce blameless *preferences* in grown adults for sex with insecure teens, insecure sexual abuse survivors, and insecure chubby women. That's not how this works. But it sure does get him misguided sympathy, and more access to sexually-abused teenagers than admitting the truth does.

I used to be a mod on a large mental health support community too. About 1k concurrent users at every hour of the clock. We banned pedos like this regularly. They crawled in to vent about their disorder, which sometimes existed and sometimes didn't, played the victim for a while, then told young girls over DM to take their clothes off.

I did something different last night.,"Bad memories often come up when I try to go to sleep. Instead of crying by myself like I usually do, I took a risk. I went to my mom's room where she was already sleeping and crawled into her bed.

Why is this a risk? Well, in years past, she's not been very understanding when I cry or get bothered over past events. The most devastating memory I have of her is her yelling at me for crying so loud to bother the neighbors. This was a couple months after my dad / her husband passed away. She often asked why I was so depressed when she was the one who lost everything. After that, I lost trust in her to show her my feelings. I would just cry alone at night whenever the feelings became overwhelming.

Slowly over the past couple years since I've moved back home, I've been working things out with her and she's reflected and apologized for not understanding how to help me. It's improved a lot, but I still never asked her for support whenever I cry at night.

Tonight, after a decade, my mother hugged me the way I wanted her to while I sobbed my heart out. 

It took some coaching to get here, but she did it. It felt like my hole inside heart started to mend. After I got all the crying out, she said she wished she could have helped me more.

We ended up chatted even more about random things, even ended up laughing during the conversation. I slept peacefully for the rest of the night sleeping next to my mom. :) I'm glad I took the risk to trust her when I'm sad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/h0qqtp/i_did_something_different_last_night/,PTSD

"Those of you with sexual trauma, do you struggle with experiencing sexual attraction?","For a bit of context: I've experienced probable CSA along with repeated sexual trauma as an adult. I'm having a really hard time recently realising that it's so difficult for me to a) experience real sexual attraction at all, b) when I do experience it, experience it consistently, and c) decipher whether or not I'm attracted to someone.

For so much of my life I've found myself projecting my general feelings of sexual desire onto someone I wasn't actually attracted to, almost always someone who's expressed attraction to me - I think very often I misread the positive feelings of validation I get from knowing someone is into me as feelings of attraction on my part.

I'll think I'm attracted to someone until I actually do anything physical with them, and then I realise I'm just not feeling it at all. But even then I'll experience the physical sensations of arousal, which is always confusing and distressing for me - it feels like it's happening against my will and makes me second-guess myself and wonder if actually I *am* attracted to the person, even though there are alarm bells in my head telling me, 'no! This isn't good for you!'

There's been one person in my life - an ex - who I'm sure I experienced real attraction towards, but even then it was inconsistent. We had a romantic/sexual relationship, and sometimes I experienced attraction so strongly and it felt so good, right, instinctive and natural (though not necessarily without PTS symptoms during sex), and other times it was just like the attraction vanished (I found this tended to be when I felt less emotionally connected to my ex and/or when my mental health was poorer).

I suppose I just want to know if anyone here has similar struggles with sexual attraction? Does any of this sound familiar to you? And does anyone have any insight or any advice?

I'm struggling so much with this at the moment and am so fearful that I'll never be able to experience normal/healthy attraction, it would just help to get a little bit more of an understanding of my feelings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/cm91po/those_of_you_with_sexual_trauma_do_you_struggle/,PTSD

I just learned I was sexually abused as a child. TW,"I'm in my early forties,. My sister is my age, and she just informed me that our brother, my own brother, sexually abused us as children. I mean, I already knew it, but it was buried so deep in my subconscious that it took this catalyst to remember. All of the memories came flooding back to me like deluge. I even remembered things that she didn't. 

I got diagnosed bipolar 2 a few years ago. My whole life has been a string of hypomania and depression. Mt father is a real life narcissist. I don't use that term ironically like a lot of people do these days. He's manipulative, mentally and physically abusive, and just all around broken. I decided around four years ago that it was time to stop trying to mend our relationship. I was constantly fighting his pull for me to satellite around him. 

So, I started going to therapy, finally. I'm learning a lot. I'm medicated and learning new coping mechanisms. I've really come a long way. 

But this is a huge revelation. My symptoms are so strikingly similar to PTSD, that I kept asking myself ""Where you sexually abused?"" 

The answer was always no. You would remember it of you really tried. Well that's not true.

I just learned this today. My sister and I cried together. My fiancé, God bless her heart, is behind me 100%. 

Here's the fucked up part. My brother and I are close. This.changes everything. He has a son and a daughter, and from what I see, he's a really good dad. It really seems he has broken the cycle of abuse. 

I don't know how to move forward. Thank goodness I have therapy this Wednesday. Thank goodness my therapist has been focusing on PTSD anyway.

Is it wrong to expose the man who groomed me online 10 years ago?,"When I confronted him a year ago, he said he was just a dumb kid and that he was sorry (but then also said he didn't do anything that I was stating). He was 19-20 and I was 11. He was in college and I was in 6th grade. I'm not gonna do anything crazy like pressing charges because no media was exchanged. Nor would they even be able to pull up the messages. It was just a few months worth of text messages back in 2013. 

I thought he was a really close friend and that no one would understand, so that's why I kept it a secret. I really loved him. I know he did the same thing with other girls between 13 & 15 (back then, he told me he obtained photos of the 15yo). I'm autistic (diagnosed in adulthood), became very depressed at the age of 10, extremely insecure. Given that I hit puberty at age 8, I felt like I was mature enough for these types of conversations and situations. 

At the time, he would ask me about masturbation. When I talked about it, he would just say cute I was. He wanted me to describe my private areas. He asked me for photos at some point which I didn't do. Tell me he loved me. He told me he had a problem with young girls (when I got upset about the 15yo). He always speaks as if he is a kid; that cringe stuff ""so cute X3"". He also really wanted to drive and pick me up (drive from Texas to Florida) for a weekend. I was too anxious, he tried to assure me that he wouldn't touch me and that my parents wouldn't even know. I never went through with this. 

Do you think he really was just an immature kid? I feel like his problem would only worsen with time. As a 21yo myself, I can't imagine doing that stuff with anyone well under 18, let alone an 11yo.

Ive been yelled at for taking an extra minute to explain things to a customer, ive been yelled at for asking questions, ive been yelled at for not being able to hear what someone said. 

Everytime this happens I lose focus. My entire body is sent into a panic mode, like fight or flight & since I'm at work I can't do anything about it so I shut down.

No, I went in there full force looked him deep into his eyes and I said 

""I dont trust you,I dont respect you and I dislike you, but still im sitting here today trying to come to an agreement for our son.
It.felt.so.good.
It felt so damn good to finally being brave enough to tell him that. And when he gave me a letter from his lawyer where he treathened me that if I dont share custody he will take me to court.

I was even braver, again I looked him into his eyes and said no, he replied ""well ill take you to court"" and what I said its insane for me to even write ""Well then bring it on"". 

I am so proud of myself, I dont care that I have not been able to eat all day or that I feel like a truck has run over me. Im so damn tired I cant think straight, but none of that matters because I

It made me such a mean person, it made me angry, hateful, spiteful, and made me say and do stupid shit that I wouldn't do if I wasn't filled with such hate. I fucking hate this. I just wanna feel normal, I just wanna love and feel loved. I want to stop feeling. I want to stop feeling everything. I just want to breathe without nightmares, I want to sleep without dreaming. I just want darkness away from these memories, away from this trauma. Away from this stress.

I have my childlike part, serious manager, performer, seducer, intellectual, etc. Each part tends to have different values, interests, emotions, and body language. 
I would make a great actress because I am great at playing the parts (I actually want to start acting again). My emotions are so intense, it can seem like I’m a different person.

Is there anyone out there with this type of trauma?,"I was overdosed as a prank by a friend on a heroic dose magic mushrooms, then was diagnosed with PTSD a year later after an attempt on my life because of severe night terrors, flashbacks, hyperarousal and paranoia. 

Long story short, i asked my friend for a microdose - and he gave me a huge dose of an incredibly strong strain of penis envy, not telling me until after i was losing my mind. I was hospitalized a week after being completely catatonic and not eating or moving from my bed.

It feels like no one understands, no matter how hard i try to explain to my friends and family. 
Why i wake up in intense panic and need to be alone for hours, why drinking makes me feel normal again, why i cant drink or eat things given to me unless i make it myself and many behavioural issues.
ive lost a lot of friends and relationships because im just not the person i used to be.
Its terrible being my age and everyone around me partying and smoking weed and doing psychedelics like i used to.

The worst thing about it is that i cant find any resources for my trauma and i cant find anyone else with it, i just want to find someone who understands.

should i tell my rapist’s wife he’s gay?,"I was raped by an older man when I was a teenager (I’m male as well). He’s in his early 70s and has a lovely life - family & kids, retirement & pension, massive house, etc. 

I chose not to pursue anything legally & still have no desire to do so. But i’m thinking about sending his wife an anonymous letter - just to inform her. This is what I would say..

Hi, Your husband assaulted me when I was 15 in your child’s bedroom. Your husband uses Grindr & has sex with young men. You should get tested for STDs because he does not use condoms. 

I would also include a few personal details & info to prove that I’m legit. (meaning your husband has a birthmark near his belly button, this is the layout of your house, this is what the inside of your house looks like, you have these photos in this place, etc. things that you can’t get from a google search) 

Should i do it? At the very least, it would give her the truth & maybe she would divorce him. 

(my parents divorced because a parent was gay so I understand what it can do to a family)

Edit: I don’t want to include identifying info but i’m in my early 20s.

"“Just go buy new clothes, go to the gym, eat vegetables and everything will be better”","Sorry for the rant but I was wondering what you guys think about this.

So basically, I have lots of unhealed trauma, starting from early childhood and the past three years with my abusive ex boyfriend destroyed me in more ways that I could imagine. 

He depleted my bank account, abused me sexually and destroyed my mental health.

What I see on here a lot is this type of advice that some people give: “just get a glow up, girl, you’ll look better and feel better”, “invest more in skincare and new clothes”, “go on dates”, Etc. 

I know that they only mean well with this type of advice. It’s meant to motivate, to feel better about oneself and so on. 

I am not saying that these things do not help with improving ones self esteem. But they are the wrong type of advice! As if I or many others HAD something to improve. As if our emotional turmoil resulting from abuse would be solved by spending 200$ at Sephora. Or signing up for dumb Yoga classes.

I was buying nice clothes and hitting the gym three times a week before I met him and also during the relationship. It didn’t change anything.

I think it’s somehow shallow to tell this people who recover from those type of relationships or any trauma because it gives them the impression that improving ones looks will improve ones self confidence.

That’s not true 100% of the time. What do you think?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/ywdgzx/just_go_buy_new_clothes_go_to_the_gym_eat/,PTSD

TW SA: I NEVER WANT TO HEAR THAT SA ACCUSATIONS RUINS A MAN'S LIFE,"Never in my life since experiencing all this did I ever think this would be a response from a person when I told them their employee assaulted me. I always thought I would hear ""Well there is no forensic evidence"", ""you're lying"" or ""you should have done xyz"". But what I read in that email broke my heart to pieces that none of those statements could have ever. For some context, I sent an email to his current employer to warn them of his past behavior that got him fired from a job before. In this job, he works with young women who are just barely adults and are so susceptible to abuse because their naive and just learning how to set boundaries and handle their alcohol, just like when I was raped by him. I was 18 and he was seven years older. Not saying that's what makes it rape, what made it rape was when I said no over and over and pushing him away throughout the assault, but it does show a power dynamic that gave him the ability to manipulate me into a position where we were alone and I had no way to escape. Anyway, this is what the email said. 

""Thank you for taking the time to write this email, and for the bravery to send it. I imagine it is not easy to remember or recount these things, and appreciate you sharing for the benefit of others. 

(His name) proactively disclosed this information to us when he began working for us, as well as its impacts on his work with (name of company). We keep it in consideration when thinking about his guiding work. It has felt important to us that (his name) has owned his mistake, and been transparent about his reflection and change. It also feels important to know, as you say, so that we would be attuned to anything that might suggest this is a pattern. 

I really appreciate you coming forward, and wish you all the best in your journey."" 

I have some seriously mixed feelings. I'm relieved to hear that he admits these things happen because now I don't have to constantly question whether I was crazy and making it up in my head. 

On the other hand, they let him off pretty much scot-free because he seemed remorseful. He has never reached out to me to tell me he was sorry or pay reparations (because fuck yeah I'm demanding money after he fucked my life up into pieces) It just makes me sick. I don't want a single man to ever tell me again that rape accusations ruin a man's life. My rapist told a future employer, showed remorse (without it involving the actual victim), was given a pass for a ""mistake"" and was given a job at a prestigious guide company. Never want to fucking hear rape accusations ruin a man's life EVER AGAIN.

Oh and also they talk about being ""attuned to a pattern"". Something has to happen twice for it to be a ""pattern"". They care more about this man's guide career than the wellbeing and safety of any woman he comes into contact with.

I right now just really need someone to explain how this could ever be ok. Maybe you've experienced the same thing. How do I ever have faith in our world or society again? How do I live with this?

I feel like I'm 'not traumatized enough' to have PTSD,"Growing up, I was raised Christian. I was a queer, paranoid, neurodivergent kid, so the fear of going to hell constantly followed me around. I had many sleepless nights were I was simply terrified that if I didn't constantly apologize to God for doubting if he was real and being apart of the LGBTQ+ community, I would burn in hell. I don't think there was a single church service where I didn't burst into tears because of the guilt I felt.

When I was 13-14, I was sexually assaulted by a 16-17 year old friend of mine. She emotionally manipulated me into thinking she was the only honest one around me, and that I could only trust her. She touched me on my thighs, kissed me, held my waist, grabbed my face, used all of the physical touch she could to reassure me that she was the truthful one. And while I was uncomfy with it, she just laughed off my worries and said that ""it was fine."" I think she might've done something even worse because of the nightmares I keep having, but I don't want to blame anyone for something they didn't do. Nonetheless, I have barely cracked the surface of what I do remember, and I don't feel comfortable sharing all of it.

These two traumatic things have lead to me having nightmares, dissossciating when I get touched, hear certain songs, having full on panic attacks when people try to hug me or hold my hand, not being able to focus sometimes cause my thoughts are so full, and even attempting suicide because of how painful it all is. When I talked about it with my therapist today, she said that I almost definitely have PTSD.

However, while some of me is relieved that I actually have a name to put on what I'm going through, the rest of me feels as though I don't have enough trauma to have PTSD. I wasn't raped (at least, not that I can remember), and while I was sexually assaulted, I can't seem to tell myself that sexual assault is enough to be a cause by itself. I can believe it when other survivors of assault have PTSD, but I feel like my trauma isnt as bad as other people's. With the religious trauma, I feel as though it's less trauma and more of me just being dramatic.

Hairdresser grabbed my face and kissed very close to my lips after haircut. Feeling triggered.,"I've been getting my haircut by a 50+ y.o. Romanian man for over a year now. He's been nothing but professional that entire time. 

When COVID hit, he started to take some clients at his home and he would charge a little less than he would in the salon. 

This was my 3rd time going to his house for a haircut. The other 2 times, everything was normal. Again, professional. Sometimes we would discuss our love lives very briefly. I knew he was dating someone recently and I was happy for him. 

At today's appointment, I wasn't very chatty. I was really tired and just enjoying the feeling of someone touching my hair. When I first arrived and he was about to shampoo my hair, he asked if I had any Valentine's plans tomorrow. I said no, I'm single this year. 

We moved on to the haircut. I noticed he had a glass of wine on his counter. He told me has hadn't eaten today and he's a little tipsy. Ha-ha. I didn't think anything of it.

He asked me if I'm straight... I'm like...""yes?"" He continued the haircut. He asked me, ""Are you on any dating sites?"" I told him I was taking a break from dating, focusing on my new job, etc. 

So, at the end of the haircut, I paid him in cash. I thanked him. And...He grabbed my face with both hands...and kissed me many times on my cheek. Like, on my smile line. Which is really close to my lips. I really thought he'd end up kissing my lips. 

I just froze up. And then he walked me out and told me to drive safe.

I came home. Called my friends and family. Took Vistaril. I'm doing okay now. But I can't stop thinking about it. 

My PTSD comes from a life time and variety of sexual assault. So this was triggering to me. I feel confused. Violated. Naive. Shameful.

Is anyone else fighting to reclaim things they love?,"Video games, a language I want to learn, calico cats, the color orange, red hair, university.

They introduced me to my all-time favorite band Glass Animals. I fucking adore them, but for almost a year after the abuse I couldn't listen to them. And it hurt more than other triggers because they mutilated something I love. And that is really shitty of them.  


Since then, I've been trying to listen to them again. I listen to half a song or a full one when I am feeling safe. I listen to them when I'm doing something fun.

When i was 10 i experienced CSA.

Shortly after for that whole year i was constantly sick i.e. stomachaches/headaches and in and off school a lot. I also had a 'virus' for months where i was coughing and would get sick but no cause was found. So like did this CSA happen for longer than i thought? I dunnno.

Now i was explaining this to my friend last night and she was like. Was none of this investigated? I was like er not that i remember  ? She was not happy either way that my mum didn't notice anything from these symptoms. 

Now that i remember the CSA as an adult i could see how all this would be connected and it just blows my mind. Now i know that the other girl that was involved her mum was complicit but was my mum aswell? or was she just naive because shes not emotionally immature?

PTSD and jump scares,"I'm a 22y/o with PTSD (mostly from a stalker/peeping tom about a year ago) and MDD. I'm feeling so weak today. This morning my friend/roommate jumped out from a closet to scare me (she thought it'd be funny), I screamed and literally fell to the floor and moments later was engulfed in a panic attack + one of the worst series of vivid flashbacks I've ever had. I've never had that happen so painfully in front of someone. She's someone who knows I have PTSD and knows a lot of what I've been through, so I guess I was even surprised she would think that would be funny, I don't blame her though, there's no way she could have known how that would affect me.

30 minutes of screaming,"[TW: Sexual assault mention, me being very mentally ill]

I've been told that there's a point in EMDR treatment where your body just purges a bunch of the trauma all at once... and I think that finally happened this week. Recently I finally started to feel safe processing my rape directly, rather than focusing on tangential memories,  so I've been starting to go there. After my session on the 23rd, I started feeling really off. I got really intense and irritable. That feeling grew inside me throughout the week, and was becoming unbearable by the time of my next session on the 30th. After that, I started to feel anxious, like there was a frog in my throat. I tried going to bed early that night, but just couldn't sleep. At around 3 am, I lost control of my body and started twitching and screaming. I'm normally used to this sort of thing, since I've been having similar panic episodes for the last 2 years, but this was more violent. I could only stop screaming to inhale then continue screaming. When my roommate found me I couldn't even acknowledge her, cause the screams were spilling out of me like vomit. I was able to come down briefly with meds, but then I just started screaming again. It felt like forever, but afterwards, I feel... lighter? Like the trauma monster inside me has gotten a little weaker. I was really shook, though. I needed to sleep 11 hours and lay down all day yesterday to feel OK today. I don't wanna jinx it, but does this mean I get to live my life now?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/i1ufid/30_minutes_of_screaming/,PTSD

Traumatic birthing experience,"Okay. So I have no idea where to start with this. I guess I should start with my pregnancy. I got pregnant last year, and me and my husband were ecstatic. But I had a very difficult pregnancy. I had pelvic pain that started around 8 weeks pregnant and continued up until I got induced. I got diagnosed with gestational diabetes, had to change my entire diet and then I was put on 9 units of insulin a day. And because of that, at 32 weeks pregnant, I had to go to the doctor and me and my daughter had to be monitored once a week. Then when I hit 36 weeks, I had to go 2x a week. And then I was induced at 39 weeks pregnant. When they were monitoring my blood pressure the day of my induction, they saw that it was high. They thought maybe it was nerves or something. So they tested my urine for protein, and it turns out I also had preeclampsia. And because of this, I had to be out on magnesium, which made my entire body hot and uncomfortable. I was already hooked up to so many things in my IV, the list just kept growing. They started the induction by using a foley balloon, wasn’t comfortable, but it was fine. Then when it fell out, I was dilated to 4 cm. Then they gave me a pill called cytotec to soften my cervix. Still wasn’t dilating much. Then they started me on pitocin. They told me that the magnesium and the pitocin would work against each other, and we were in for a long ride. I got some IV pain meds at some point. I still wasn’t dilating, and it had been about 12 hours in. I’m only at a 6. Doctor came in, and they had to turn my daughters head in my uterus by hand because she was facing up and she needed to be facing down. This was super painful. (I can’t remember if I had gotten an epidural yet or not) but they think they got it. And then I started dilating more and more over the course of what seemed like forever. It was over 48 hours from the start that they told me that I was at a 9. And my epidural would move to one side when I laid on my right side. So I would feel all of my contractions on my left side. And then when I laid on my left side, it fixed itself. So eventually, I started pushing at the 56 hour mark. My epidural wore off and I could feel almost everything. I pushed her out for the next 2 hours. I had to get a tiny episiotomy. And when she came out, everyone sighed a sigh of relief because it was over. But little did we know, it wasn’t over. They laid her on my chest, and the doctors were trying to get the placenta out. They took my daughter to the warmer, and my husband followed. They started to massage my uterus, but it hurt. Really really bad. It hurt worse than pushing my baby out. I asked the doctor “Why are you doing it that hard?!” 
She looked at me and said “Trust me, you want me to be doing this.”
 My mom is standing next to me looking worried as hell, which doesn’t help the fact that I’m freaking out. I then hear one of the doctors tell the other one something about me needing blood. I start freaking out, so I try to call my husband over, but I’m to weak and he can’t hear me. My father in law gets his attention, and he comes over to me. I tell him that I need blood, and he’s freaking out. 

All of a sudden, I start to get really really sleepy. I ask my husband if I can go to sleep, the nurse said yes, and my mom said no. I tried to stay awake, my husband was trying to ask me questions to keep me awake. But I passed out. Well more like blacked out because my husband says my eyes were still open. He told me I threw up multiple times (I only remember 1 time). He told me that when he would try to talk to me, I would just stare at him with this blank look on my face and in my eyes. Like I wasn’t really there. There are a few things that I remember during my black out. I remember trying to answer people when they would talk to me. It felt like I was screaming, but nothing was coming out of my mouth. I remember seeing this new person in the room that wasn’t there before. Turns out he was like the head doctor or some shit. Then I saw that doctor doing an ultrasound because they put a balloon in my uterus to stop the bleeding and then I went back under. And then I started to come to when they hooked up the blood bag to my IV. I can’t remember when, but I’m pretty sure they gave me another epidural after I gave birth. They usually take out the catheter, but they left mine in. I remember being in the most immense amount of pain I’ve ever been in. My mom had to help me shower because I could barely move. 

I know there are a lot of things that I’m leaving out, but I can’t really remember all of it. 

But because of all this, I feel so messed up. Every time I watch a show or a movie where someone is giving birth, I cry. Every single time. And it freaks me out because I can talk about what happened to me, and not cry or have flashbacks (most of the time). But when I see a labor and delivery room on TV, I get scared and I cry. My friend gave birth 2 months after me, and I was gonna go visit her, but I got scared of going back to the hospital. Every time I have my period, the blood scares me and I think something is wrong with me again. I was afraid to go home after being in the hospital because I thought I was gonna die. I’m scared to get pregnant again. 

I feel like I can’t talk about this with anyone because they’ll get annoyed and think I only want to talk about myself. I’m going to therapy, but I’m not sure if it’s working yet. 

I also just lost almost all of my friends because I just had a very bad anxiety episode, and I actually let people see what I was going through. And they all bailed. So I’m afraid to open up to anyone. My husband is deployed now. So it’s just me and my daughter most of the time.

7 years ago I experienced pretty bad SA, r*pe, digital r*pe, sexual harassment , grooming. I got an std from the event. Actually i was r*ped during my first hsv outbreak and yes it was the worst pain ive ever experienced. Today i was telling my husband about some of the most embarrassing and painful (literally) details. Things i never told anybody, not even therapists, because nobody seems to want to hear it. 

A few (ex) friends/family members knew what happened back then but werent there for me at all. Never check in on me. Nothing. People who didnt know could clearly tell SOMETHING was off - i mean for gods sake i would lay in my room in the dark for weeks… months … nobody asked how i was doing, nobody asked what was wrong. 

To this day nobody asks. Like they want to pretend nothing happened to me. To be fair im not close to most of the people i knew back then..but i cant help but be pissed at their lack of care. Im so traumatized by friendships and people i just dont associate with anyone anymore. 

Idk what the point of this post is but i just had to shout into the void that im hurt i guess.

I found my dead uncle.,"I was laying in bed a few years ago just casually playing div rivals when my mum came running in. She was uncontrollably screaming at me to run to my uncles house who lives just across the road. It turns out my grandmother had called my mum and got her to get me to run over. She already knew what was waiting for me in that house and she let me run right past her into the thick of it. So yeh back to the time line, I dashed some bottoms on and ran across the road. I jumped the fence, sprinted through her front garden and straight into the front door. There he was. Hanging from the stars by a dog lead. I went to the kitchen to try and get a knife out but I collapsed. I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t think, I couldn’t see, all I could do was hear my mum run in behind me and let out a scream I’ve never heard before; this brought me back to reality. I forgot about the knife and went straight to him. I held him up while my mum tried to undo the knots but she couldn’t so we swapped. It got to the point where I was chewing through the dog lead to try and get him down. The next thing I remember is the 2 policeman and 1 woman coming in and dragging me off him. I no longer speak to anyone from that side of the family, mainly my grandmother as she knew what she was setting me up to see. No idea if this is right or this is how I do it, I just saw these Reddit posts on tik tok and thought it was a good idea to get some shit out. But now I’m fucked for the rest of my life, I can’t ever walk into a room first, going up stairs brings back flashbacks, the nightmares are horrendous and non stop. I forgot to mention that my uncle was my mums youngest brother, she has 3, and he was more of a big brother to me than anything, he took me to the cinema, to play rugby and football, we went on drives together for no reason.

"Any other sexual abuse survivors constantly fear being sexualized then shame yourself thinking, “Who do you think you are? You’re not even that attractive.”","Any other sexual abuse survivors constantly fear being sexualized then shame yourself thinking, “Who do you think you are? You’re not even that attractive.”

I am frequently fearful of being sexualized or liked by any one into women (male or female). I’ve been sexually harassed and abused throughout my life and I run away from people who start liking me or sexualize me. I just don’t believe there are men (or women into women) who are attracted to me that won’t sexualize me. I mean my own dad had a crush on me and sexualized me (covert child sexual abuse). I mean we are all sexual beings, is it even possible not to sexualize someone you’re attracted to? 

I now have a gay female therapist who I connect with so well but I have this fear of being sexualized. Sometimes I think I end up manifesting my fears because I focus so much energy Onto it due to my PTSD. I feel guilty for feeling this way about her because I don’t want to offend or hurt her especially because she is coming from an oppressed group. But there have been times where I’ve caught her looking at my legs and I felt she was attracted to them.

When I start thinking of this: what if they become attracted to me or sexualize me.. then I shame myself like, “who do you think you are? You’re not even they attractive. You’re so cocky to think people are gonna like you.” I now realize that my dad said the same thing to me when I confronted him. He said, “you’re not even beautiful.. I wouldn’t look at you down the street.. I’m sick Of your sick fantasies..” Then I’m like, “maybe I just want the attention.. maybe I want them to be attracted to me.” Which confuses me because yes, everyone wants to be attractive and have attention, but not unwanted sexualization or attention.

Maybe I just need time because I haven’t been seeing this therapist for very long yet, and the scheduling has been inconsistent.

Does anyone get triggered by things that have nothing to do with your trauma? (TW),"I was diagnosed with PTSD 13 years ago. Since then I have figured out all of my triggers and have done my best to work through them. However, I have one trigger that is super random and has nothing to do with what caused my trauma! 

Here is some background-

When I was 5 I was sexually assaulted

When I was 10 I witnessed my dad try and murder my mom. He was on some sort of drugged and just flipped out on her. I'm not going to go into detail because it still makes me shake but it was horrifying.

When I was 14 I was raped.

All of my triggers from these are triggers you could imagine. I have one trigger though that is super random?! Whenever I am in a car and it starts to storm or if i am in a car with a driver who drives somewhat fast I immediately get triggered and break down into an episode. I have no idea why this happens? This trigger is bigger than all of my other ones too? 

Does anyone else ever go through something like this? I'm just always so confused over it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/cn9r9i/does_anyone_get_triggered_by_things_that_have/,PTSD

Mother trying to move on after finding out 12 year out daughter was raped,"Edit: WARNING. This horror has become so apart of my life now that I’m use to it. And I forget that it really fucks people up just hearing about it it’s so traumatic. So just to prepare it’s about aggravated sexual assault with young children.


Ok so I found out this summer that my daughter who is 12 now was raped when she was 7 multiple times by my best friends husband. She told me that it finally stopped when she went to her best friend, (my best friends daughter) and asked her to tell her dad to stop. And then it didn’t happen again after that. I called my best friend and told her what I just found out. She was shocked and had doubts but said she would ask her daughter if she remembers that. She called me back an hour later crying cuz her daughter admitted and admitted he’s been raping her too starting when she was 5. His own daughter. she kicked her husband out and we called the police and I’m very happy to say after a week of working with the fbi. my friend got him to confess to it all while the fbi was listening. He’s now in jail waiting trial. Finding this all out has devastated our whole family. My husband had to come home early from his deployment we were so devastated. Months have gone by. I signed My daughter up for trauma counseling and they said after two sessions she doesn’t need trauma counseling. That she has moved on from this and is not traumatized by it. I asked my daughter if that was true and she said yes she just wants to move on and be a normal family again. I tell her ok and say help is there for you if you need it. I know this is what she wants and she doesn’t want this to be our life. but I’m having a hard time moving on and I don’t want to upset her. I can’t stop thinking about it. It doesn’t make sense. How the fuck did I not see this.. how did my friend. not see this. Our family have been so close for the last ten years. We get together 3 times a week for ten years. He was so fucking normal. How did I not see this monster who raped his 3 biological daughters now we know, and my daughter was next to me this whole time. We are both stay at home moms. Our kids are our everything. And these kids were always happy. We never once saw them in pain or saw bloody underwear or saw her crying around him. And they had to have been and I can’t move on from my confusion. How was this massive absolute horror happening for years and no one had a clue. And the guilt. My job is to protect her and I failed. No matter what I do for the rest of her life I have failed as her mother. I don’t know how to not have this be my life. I’m never gonna not be devastated or confused or fulled with so much guilt. Everyone says I need therapy but I don’t see the point. On the outside I’m normal. I’m ok I’m not crying on the couch for days. I’m playing with my kids and my husband and I are great. We really leaned on each other. He agrees with my daughter and wants to move on. I feel like my family is moving forward and I can’t stop thinking about it. Lucky I have my best friend still. And she is the only one who understand what I’m going through. But it’s not the same. She understands that for about two years of my life all my photos are ruined. Every photo from the time she was 6-8 all I think about is was this when she was raped? Is she in pain in this photo and she pretending? My friend understands this because all the photos for the last 18 years are ruined for her. And she feels all this guilt and more. I can’t imagine what she is going though. She lost her husband who she thought they “we’re happy” but realizes it was all a lie. She lost her dream house(that she closed on three days before we found out)She lost 2/3 of her income. And she has the guilt of this happening to her three daughters. She knows what I’m going through more then anyone. But what I’m going through doesn’t even compare to what she’s going though. I don’t want to complain to her about my family going back to normal and happy and I’m just frozen with my thoughts. 

Ok so not I explained what I’m going though I was wondering if anyone has gone through something similar. And I’m wondering if me frozen with my horror in my head is just my normal and I need to except it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/kzg0s5/mother_trying_to_move_on_after_finding_out_12/,PTSD

I blocked someone who causes me triggers and I feel better.,"Man. I told this person to leave me alone. Why?

She was a callous idiot after my accident. She broke my heart, and made me feel  so miserable just 2 days after my accident.  I cried even more because of that and i really wanted to die in that moment. 

After that, i was an idiot. I tried to forget that and give her another chance. 

Let's just say that she took advantage of my affected mental state and made me into a person who did what she wanted for a little comfort from her. But anyway. Half year later, i realized what she was doing to me, and how she even physically hurt me. So, i left her. And I made it clear to her to leave me alone. Thanks to the quarantine, now i could be away in all ways from her. 

Almost. Tonight she started following me on Instagram. I had a little trigger about the accident when i sawed the notification. I wasn't in panic, but it felt bad. So i decided to block her. I don´t know. First i tough that i was been immature. But, now that i'm writing this, i just feel better. Like, in peace. I don't know...

  
I just wanted to vent myself writing this. I think it was the best decision. That person just makes me anxious and makes me fall into flashbacks. There is nothing good in that person.

Today I stand up to my CEO,"Update: Thank you SO MUCH for the insight, kindness, and support. I read a lot of encouraging comments right before I went in and again after I came out. I practiced what i was going to say over and over again that morning.  I didn't cry or lose my place and I stuck to facts only. One person in upper management in particular really had my back. After the meeting I cried a bunch and then went up and down several flights of stairs over and over until I was ready to go back to work.  I really do appreciate all of the kind words. I'll keep reading them to get myself through the next few weeks as well.

About 6 weeks ago my boss made a joke about sexual abuse of children. I didn't feel like I could do anything about it because he is the CEO. Shortly after that he made a joke about women in the workplace speaking up about sexual harassment. 

I wound up in partial hospitalization and diagnosed with PTSD related to several traumas including sexual assault I experienced as a child.

I asked for a meeting with all of upper management so that I can start back up at work with clear boundaries for what I won't accept anymore.

My boyfriend witnessed his friend get killed.,"My boyfriend is a road cyclist. He is part of a team and most if not all of his friends are cyclists as well. The last couple of years he became extremely close to this friend, he found a new lifestyle within him. He’s noticeably healthier thanks to their time spent together. My boyfriend always spoke highly of his friends mind, body and spirit. From the very beginning his friend was someone special to the point where he would introduce him as his angel to other friends. They spent countless hours together training on the road. They spent at least three sometimes four days out of the week training together. They have different routes to train on but last Thursday morning they decided to go train on the “safest route” to just loosen their legs a bit. It’s the same route they’ve ridden on hundreds of times. A route where generations before them would train on. Even a route where my boyfriend would take me to ride on. It was like any other day. My boyfriend left the house around 7am to meet up with his group and they were on the road by 7:30. My boyfriend and two other friends escaped the peloton and were a few minutes ahead so my boyfriend decided to send a text to the rest of the group to let them know they slowed their rhythm to wait for them. As he was texting he got left a few meters behind and within that split second a car going more than double the speed limit estimated 200 km per hour veered past the white line of the highway and struck his friend. My boyfriend just heard an explosion looked up and saw his friend in the air and saw how he fell to the ground. His other friend was right next to him when it happened. They were in shock to say the least. He says he saw his friends soul leave his body in an unexplainable way he just saw a part of him leave. The car did not stop. The driver left with the bike incrusted in the car. I can’t even imagine the helplessness they felt in that very moment. Please respect cyclists. They’re practicing their passion. Keep your distance and respect their space. The pain in our hearts could have been completely avoided. It was a senseless murder. My heart aches for his family, friends, and my boyfriend. I wish I can take his pain and the image out of his head. Everything is very recent we can only take it a day at a time. Everything was taken within a split second. I’ve mentioned seeking therapy for this traumatic experience but he’s not interested and insists in just living through the process on his own. He says it’s something that will never leave his mind. All I can do is be there for him and listen when he wants to talk. If there’s any tips on how I can help him deal with all he’s been through I’d appreciate it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/18s56mf/my_boyfriend_witnessed_his_friend_get_killed/,PTSD

“Fawning” Trauma response,"A couple sessions ago my therapist told me she believed I suffer from severe “fawning” response… I laughed at her and told her she was far from the truth and that I am absolutely not a people pleaser. Come to find out she was right… Of course.
I went to a house party with a group of people that I don’t know very well. It was the first time I noticed how bad my fawn response is to people I don’t know or trust. (This was one of the first times my husband and I didn’t go to this house party together so I was already anxious not having my best friend with me). Than this one guy at the party randomly told me to hold his hand…I didn’t want to at all, I literally got the ick feeling but I froze and it felt as though “autopilot” kicked in and I just obeyed what he said. I was so uncomfortable but I couldn’t say no so I looked around the room for something that required two hands to pick up so I didn’t have to touch him. The thought of any confrontation with a person I don’t know scared me so much. 
I didn’t even remember it happened until days later when the memory of the incident popped in my head out of nowhere. I immediately called my husband crying, feeling like a piece of shit. (He’s such an amazing man, he was so understanding and comforting but I still feel so fucking dumb).
I used to pride myself with having boundaries but since my SA, I literally can’t say no to anyone. I will run myself to the ground, drain myself, make myself uncomfortable and go against my morals just to appease people. I can’t keep having this response…I can’t do it anymore. How do I stop ?

I know for myself:

* Jack Herer helps clear my thoughts, great for daytime
* Strains with limonene also great for a clearer headspace for me
* any sort of Girl Scout Cookies variety makes me anxious and shaky/trembling, not a fan
* Romulan or a similar heavy hitter gets me to sleep on the toughest nights

"My abusive ex called me after 3,5 years of no contact and it triggered my ptsd","So my (23f) ex (22m) and I were in a relationship when I was 18. We were together for a year before I broke up with him because he was so abusive.
He used to hit me, gave me a black eye, choked me, told me I deserved all of it, isolated me and made me lose all of my friends and even had me write down rules he had for me.

He was my first bf and it broke me. A month after I broke up with him I met my current bf and we have been together for 3,5 years now, he is amazing. Has always been very patient with me and convinced me to get therapy. I was in therapy for ptsd for a year and it helped a lot. I'm still not where I want to be but I'm ALOT better.

Last night at 10.30 pm I was watching a tv show with my bf and an unknown number called me. I did recognize it from somewhere but I couldn't remember from where. My bf decided to call the number with his phone because he knows I hate being called by random people. A guy picked up and they had a short conversation where my bf asked him why he called me and who he was. The guy just said it didn't matter and hung up.

I recognized his voice immediatly and I had trouble breathing. My bf asked me if I was okay and if I wanted to call him myself. I did and when he picked up he said he called me by accident which I dont believe. I could only get an ""okay"" out of my mouth before he said goodbye and hung up. But I am still freaked out about it.

My boyfriend was really sweet after it happened and kept hugging me and telling me that I'm in good hands now. I just can't get it out of my head. I also had trouble sleeping.

Learned something new from OBGYN,Backstory: had an ovarian cyst rupture the other day. I had to go for a pelvic exam to make sure it was draining properly and that there were not more cysts. Being that I just turned 21 I had not gotten an exam before. That being said when she was doing the exam she had hinted at the fact that I had pelvic floor problems. My muscles were too tight and as a result I had problems trying to hold a kegel. When I asked her if there was something I could do to train my body and why it happens she told me that it’s normal for women who have had sexual abuse. Sexual abuse is so common and I am so mad that we are not taught about the physical effects that stick with us!

Birth sent me mentally back ten years NSFW,"I just gave birth two weeks ago. Me and my husband prepped A LOT beforehand. We had several appointments at the hospital kind of planning how to make this birth as comfortable for me as possible. I read like 7 books about giving birth, went to two birthing courses (one where we paid extra so it was just me and my husband there) and read up on C-sections just in case a natural birth wouldn't work out. The hospital staff were amazing, respectful and kind. Everytime a man had to come in to the delivery room he introduced himself first and I felt comfortable.

I had to be induced and went through four days of really painful contractions and I nailed it! I was calm and felt so powerful. Then her heart rate dropped significantly and the safe birthing suite were swapped out with an operation room and tons of doctors, noise, bright lights and basicly all the things that make me terrified. I had a panic attack apparently, but I can't really remember it that well. My daughter made it(thank God). 

Things have been... Bad afterwards to say the least.. 

When I met my husband ten years ago I was a wreck. I was terrified of men, couldn't trust anybody and I felt unsafe constantly.
After years of therapy and self work I was in a really good place. I went off my meds about a year and a half ago (with help from my doctor) and I felt safe and confident. 

Now I don't anymore. I'm not just terrified for myself, but also for my daughter. I can't deal with men being near her or me. That includes my husband. I don't sleep, because I have to protect myself and her. When I basicly collapse from exhaustion I have nightmares about what caused me to get ptsd so many years ago and again I wake up terrified.

My husband is trying his best to take care of me and he backs off when he sees how terrified I am. This should be a happy time, but instead I just feel to lost and empty.

Male sexual assault survivor and I just got diagnosed with PTSD. Still don't feel like my case is bad enough.,"I was recently diagnosed with PTSD stemming from a sexual assault that occurred last year. I have had nightmares, flashbacks, being overly cautious, etc. 

I still don't feel like my case is nearly as bad as others, as my sexual assault only lasted about 15 seconds, and was from an intimate partner. I am also a man, and it was done to me by a woman. It was very painful and I still can feel the pain vividly in my mind. It was a horrible experience.

I feel like my body wasn't only raped, but so was my mind. It's a hellish existence I'm living. But I don't feel like my case is nearly as bad as some others I've heard. I never thought I would be sexually assaulted because I was never taught that this can happen to men, and I'm very ashamed for feeling the way I do.

I'm not really an emotional guy, but that night I let everything out. I wasn't shamed or ridiculed, I was actually comforted.

Does anyone else feel like their excuse for having PTSD isn't 'bad enough?'',"I was in a toxic relationship. Yes, I did feel emotionally abused by them, but it was an online relationship. It has been 2-3 months since I broke up with them and I just feel like I am a crybaby and should get over it already because they probably have forgotten me. Since also I grieved over a fictional character (as stupid as it sounds.) I still avoid things that remind me of their death.

The relationship I had gave me a derealization disorder, (dissociation) which is caused by stress. Does this mean I need help? or should I get over it? I really just want closure and comfort.

DAE feel like they're living a double-life with their trauma and daily life?,"I'm not sure if the title makes sense but I feel so out of place to normal life a lot. I feel like the life I should be living is one thing which I outwardly act like I do.

But then I also constantly carry all these memories of traumatic things that affect me a lot. It's like a whole different world I feel like I'm in than my healthy, non-traumatized peers. It's constantly full of all these triggers and emotions and memories and just so much, always something affecting me or something going on, but it's kept so hidden to those around me. I've had people joke about getting PTSD from a test we had right in front of me and I feel so distanced and out of place. They have no idea all the things that take up my mind all the time. And I'm aware I don't know about theirs, either, but I'm curious if this is a trauma (/traumatized individual trying to assimilate with normal society) thing maybe specifically, or not

I've felt this way growing up as well with abuse going on in my family and having to hide it outwardly, as well. I don't know if it's that I'm feeling isolated, maybe? I'm really not sure and brain fog is big today. I would love to hear other's opinions and experiences with this though",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/sdmeu0/dae_feel_like_theyre_living_a_doublelife_with/,PTSD
I hate American healthcare,"I am extremely lucky, I have amazing insurance through my parents, and I can get a lot of things covered.

Idk if it’s okay to embrace that since it’s comforting or if it’s something I should be careful with.

Human Trafficking Is Absolutely Terrifying!,"The thing about intuition is that you can only sense it before it happens, but it doesn't tell you when or how it's going to happen, and it doesn't tell you how to protect yourself from the danger that gave you the feeling in the first place. I questioned what made this movie about human trafficking give me the feeling that something terrible was going to happen to me, yes, what happened in the movie can happen in real life, but I couldn't even imagine something like that happening to me, because I was fat. A year later, when I was in my twenties, I lost weight, and later, my life began to spiral, and that's when an older guy I met introduced me to cocaine. A few months later he said he is in love with me and asked how I felt about him, I told him he is a great guy, and a great friend, but I love him more like a brother, I apologized to him for not feeling the same, he said it’s okay, he understands, he’s cool with it and I don't have to be sorry. Nothing changed, we hung out twice and everything was okay and normal, on the third day I had such a terrible feeling but I didn't care because I needed cocaine to feel better, as I pulled into the parking lot to meet him, that feeling grew stronger so I asked him if he could come inside my car this time, but he said no because he had already taken it out of the bag and prepared it for me in his car. After I closed my window, I told myself to just relax, because today is no different from any other day, I didn't trust my words of reassurance, so I left my car doors unlocked and when I sat in his car I left the door open with my leg hanging out the door, he asked me to close the door, and I said I can’t because my car is unlocked, that I had to be able to attack whoever tried to steal it, he didn't ask me again, and that calmed me down. He waited until I was high off the cocaine to offer me the weed, I took a few hits and started choking, but he had a full bottle of water for me. As the drugs began to take effect, he started driving with my leg still hanging out the door, if I hadn't been so high, I would have thought to jump out of the car, but instead I shut the door. I have smoked weed before and I mixed it with cocaine, mixed drugs with other drugs and alcohol but none of them had an effect on me like this, something must have been in the water, I think I blacked out, when I opened my eyes we were on the highway, I asked where  are we were going, and then I fell asleep, I kept waking up and passing out. One of the times I woke up, I remember hearing him say that he sells woman and makes a lot of money, and then I fell back asleep, I slept the rest of the way, and when he woke me up, we were parked in someone's driveway. We walked into the house and there was a man standing there with a bottle of vodka, he ordered me to drink it, I said no, and then he and the guy who kidnapped me forced it down my throat. I remember the house, there was no furniture, and in the bedrooms there was a mattress in each room with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress did not have a bed frame or any furniture. As the two guys spoke in the kitchen, I had the worst feeling I ever had in my life, the l human trafficking movie had crossed my mind, I thought I was never going see my family again, as high and intoxicated as I was, I had to try to find a way out of that house, because I didn't want to find out what might happen to me. I walked into one of the bedrooms to see if I could open the window just in case I needed to quickly escape, the curtain was dark, and the window was boarded up, I remembered when my kidnapper told me he loved me so I asked him if I could speak to him in private, I said it was really important because I can't keep this secret any longer than I have, he walked up to me and asked what is it? I said I lied when I told him I love him like a brother because I was afraid if I was honest with him, it would hurt me if I ever lost him. He asked if I was serious, I said yes and I hugged him tightly, he was totally shocked, excited, and then he told me he will be right back because he had to call off a deal he had made with his friend, I was standing in the empty living room when I heard a glass bottle shatter and I was afraid the friend of the guy who kidnapped me had killed him. When my kidnapper walked into the living room, unharmed, I felt so relieved, the other guy was also unharmed, as we were heading towards the door, I turned my head to the kitchen and saw the bottle of vodka shattered in pieces on the floor, and the guy seemed really angry, because he was silent when I said goodbye to him. On the car ride back to the Walmart where my car was parked, he told me that the deal he made with the guy was not his friend, it was his client, and the deal he made was to sell me, that man was going to buy me, with real money, buy me when I am a human being, not an object. He informed me that the house I had been taken to was the first stop, and I was going to be transported to another house somewhere else, I asked him which location and he said his client couldn't tell him because he knows me personally, it's a security thing to prevent him from coming back to pick me up if he changed his mind after I had been sold. He said he just wanted to be honest with me because he didn't want the beginning of our relationship to begin with a secret hidden from me, especially when it is a secret that involves me, I knew I had to watch what I say because my behavior and my actions were closely monitored, and I was petrified to be taken back to that house. I said, I forgive you baby, because I understand that some people just have to do whatever it takes to make money to support their families, I know that your father had passed away and you are trying to take care of your mother, I said this doesn't change my love for you, nothing ever will change that, he smiled and kissed me, he believed me, he held my hand, and I made sure I didn't let go while I was awake, I felt like it was the right time to close my eyes and sleep because I was still high and intoxicated, so I told him I was going to take a nap, he said, go ahead baby, I love you, and I said I love you too baby. When he woke me up, we were parked next to my car, still feeling petrified that he would take me back to that man's house, as he closely observed my reaction when I looked at my car, I had to keep playing it cool until I was safe, I said in a funny way, wow, nobody stole my car when the doors are all unlocked, he laughed, and then we hugged and kissed each other goodbye, I sat inside my car, acting like I was doing something as I was waiting for him to drive away, and after he drove off, I broke down in tears and thought of all the girls in the world who are victims of human trafficking, all the girls who are being held captive, my heart breaks for them and my heart goes out to them all. I know that I have no right to say that I know how it feels to be a victim of human trafficking, but I felt the terror that comes with it, the fear that I will never see my family again, and the end of my life as I knew it before. This was by far the scariest and most traumatic day I had ever experienced in my life, please do not tell me that I am lucky to have escaped, or that this makes me a brave person because I am not. I feel disgusted with myself and I feel so incredibly guilty for what I said to him, I hate myself for feeling so petrified that I had gone so far as to pretend to be okay with the fact that he sells innocent woman to make money, I wish I said screw my life and stood up for all the victims of human trafficking, I am so sorry.

"I should have trigger warning stamped on my forehead - just a venting session, no actual triggers","Does anyone else feel like they been through sooo much that trauma or common triggers appear normal except for the fact that most things people learn about you shock them? Is it odd to be triggered by others reactions to your own life? 

For example, say someone asks me about my mom and I say “oh she passed”. Asking about my mom didn’t bother me but watching your jaw drop did. 

The weirdest thing is that I often feel the compulsion to share my traumas when I’m doing poorly but I’m too afraid to over share people into shock. It’s like I try to tell on myself to people I just met that “warning I’m messed up. Traumatized enough to trigger a whole blocks radius. Potential friends have been warned”.

"How should I proceed with this? Therapist said she doesn’t think I have PTSD, even though I am professionally diagnosed.","I was diagnosed with PTSD a few months ago by a licensed psychologist. I had to get a 2 hour psychological assessment in order for me to get disability accommodations at my university. It was a surprise, but made sense. I never bothered to look at the PTSD symptoms. I always thought I had extreme anxiety mixed with paranoia. 

I have been seeing my therapist for around 5 months now and to say she knows me is a lie. I have not even told her half of the stuff I’ve been through. Part of that is because I think I’m repressing some trauma, but some of it is vague enough to be remembered. 

Anyways, I told her about it and she doubted it and made this confused face. She even said everyone has trauma and basically made me feel invalidated? She even looked up the symptoms on her phone to “rediagnose me”. I really like her as an *eating disorder* therapist, she has helped me very much with my anorexia, but I dunno this made me feel very invalidated and shitty. 

What should I do about it? Does she have a right to doubt it?

/r/ptsd suicide & serious self-harm policy,"Hey /r/ptsd community,

I hope you're doing at least okay and that you had a good new year, be it with friends, with family, if you're isolating or just having me time.  2020 has been a rough year for all of us, but I am hopeful that 2021 will be better.  Here's to all your successes, your survival, and if nothing else, to just getting by, because that's still something.

Since we have over the holidays again received a few posts regarding suicide, we (the /r/ptsd mods) have decided to institute a suicide policy, which will be added to the sidebar since there hasn’t been one stated anywhere previously and we think it’s time we posted one. Basically:

We recognize [Reddit’s Suicide Policy](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043513931) and posts or comments advocating it will be removed. If you are seeking help you will be directed to /r/suicidewatch and [their resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines)--since we cannot know where somebody is located and cannot maintain an international directory. Suggesting others commit suicide will result in an immediate ban.

If you see any suicidal posts, please report them to us.  While the mods are spread across different timezones, we do have the ability to review every post that comes in.

In the spirit of mod transparency, if we see a user is posting something with suicidal or serious self-harm tendencies, we will take the following actions:

* we will inform reddit, using the report function. Which you are also welcome to do as well, in addition to reporting to us, so that we can react ASAP.

> Reddit has partnered with [Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/) to provide redditors who may be considering suicide or seriously hurting themselves with support from trained Crisis Counselors. If you’re worried about someone, you can let us know by reporting the specific post or comment that worried you and selecting, *Someone is considering suicide or serious self-harm*. After you let us know, we’ll reach out (confidentially) to put them in touch with Crisis Text Line’s trained Crisis Counselors.

* the post will be removed, per the recommendation of the [National Suicide Prevention Alliance](https://www.nspa.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NSPA-Guidelines-Responding-to-Suicidal-Content-Online.pdf)

> ""Unsafe content can have a negative and potentially dangerous impact on others, and should be removed""

* And we will follow up with a public reply for OP, as well as anybody from the community who may come across said post:

> Hey /u/[OP], we’ve seen your post and we’re worried about you. If you are considering suicide, please call a [hotline](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines) and/or visit /r/SuicideWatch. The best way of getting a timely response is through a hotline.

> /r/ptsd may not be the best place for your post. While we are a support community, we are not professionals. A lack of responses to your post does not show a lack of interest in willing to support you.

> If you are looking for a dialogue, please visit /r/SuicideWatch or call a hotline. /r/SuicideWatch has an extensive wiki page with suicide hotlines around the world, in many languages.

> Please understand that, as your post may trigger difficult or distressing emotions in other people, including suicidal feelings, I have decided to remove your post from /r/ptsd's listing.

> If you can, please post your message again. If not, remember that there are services available in every country if there is someone you would like to talk/chat/text: [a list can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/hotlines). If you’re not sure you can keep yourself safe, please contact your GP/doctor, go to A&E/hospital or call your emergency number. Please take care.


Do you have any thoughts, comments, or wishes regarding our policy?

Take care, and I wish you all a better 2021!

I need to talk about last night,"I've been volenteering as a firefighter even in the mists of COVID-19 outbreak . I know it's dangerous but we got to protect our neighbors and loved ones. About a month ago I was in Nashville when the tornadoes happened and saw first hand of the damage. I was there for 2 weeks after school helping . 

Last night I was driving off the clock and was right infront of a roll over crash . Girl ran a red light and guy had the right away. He flipped 3 times and watching it was like out of a movie. I ran up with a tryna kit I keep in the car and he was stuck in the truck. I had to break through his windshield to get him out . 

After 2 minutes I got in and pulled him out . He had glass in his face and blood was Everywhere. Looking at him I realized I went to school with him and he was my teachers kid. I layed him down and looked for DNR signs (do not resuscitate) and he didn't have any so I proceeded to begin CPR. He woke up to tell me to call his dad and as I called the EMT came in to get him.  .

He did not make it. The lady was under the influence. I feel so ashamed when I was in the class and the teacher wasn't there . I cried in class and feel guilty that I couldn't save him . Hunter I'm so sorry buddy. 

I have flashbacks to that night and I haven't been able to work since that night until I'm cleared.

I accepted her as she was and loved her. I tried to support her to the best of my abilities, but looking back, I think now that I fell short of what more I could have done and all the occasions when my actions triggered her. 

I am new to Reddit and cannot get myself to share detailed description of what happened. I have typed multiple times and deleted. Maybe at a later point I can share more details but I just wanted to post to this community because I think people here can really understand the pain that she had.

I don’t know what I am looking for from this community. Consider this as my venting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1g1zjur/did_i_do_my_best_to_save_her/,PTSD

It really put me behind in life,"I used to be smart and able to accomplish stuff. I nowadays struggle to function normally. Something happened to my brain that I just became dumb. My judgement became cloudy and my life a succession of errors.

I see that there is a pattern among people with my history.

It’s specially hard Watching people who are dumber than me succeed in life while I’m always behind. I still try and do my best but the reality is that the trauma put me behind one million years. 

Anyone else feels like they would have been a completely different person? 

Why do I see this pattern everywhere : people with ptsd making a succession of errors all their life?

Anyone else have survival mode nightmares that aren't directly connected to the actual traumatic event?,"I have a medical trauma and some kind of body related trauma because of an absurd amount of pain I had to go trhough for a year with doctors telling me i'm crazy and shouldn't belive my instincts about there being something wrong in my body.

I hate having a female perpetrator,"TW for CSA, COCSA, rape, transphobia

I want to start this out by saying that I am a transgender woman. I am legally male, and I have a penis. This is important to what I say in this post.

When I was 16, I was raped by a cisgender woman. Multiple times. She saw me as a man, and tried to convince me that I was one. She was my only friend at the time. I knew that what she was doing was abusive, but I did not stop her from assaulting and raping me for a few reasons:

1) I did not want to lose my only friend.

2) I felt that if I used my superior physical strength to push her off of me, I would be easily framed as an attacker, as someone who would be considered a man in court.

I hate that my attacker was female. Had she been male, I would have more people willing to support me. It is so tiring having to deal with people thinking that the damage done to me was less, both physically and mentally, than it would have been if my attacker had been a male. I’m tired of being told I am “just lucky for getting sex” or other things along those lines. 

I have also been sexually assaulted over 40 times since by other cisgender women.

I hate that had I reported, people would care even less because in most places cis women aren’t even considered to be capable of rape.

I hate that I could even be framed for it. I was forced to penetrate. I hate dealing with the paranoia that if I say something she would turn it around on me calling me the rapist because I was the one penetrating. 

I often find myself wishing that she was a man, and I feel awful for that. I see and hear the difficulties that victims of men face. I don’t want to downplay their pain in any way, shape, or form. And yet..I remain jealous. So infuriatingly jealous. They have support groups, legal backing, so much more representation and acknowledgement.. 

I wish that I had somewhere I could relate to others. For me, going to a support group would mean going to a men’s support group, which misgenders me. Going to a women’s support group would mean being surrounded by people who are seen as potential rapists and predators by my PTSD, and who’s experiences I cannot relate to as someone who was forced to penetrate..

Then there is also the shame, transphobia, racism..everything else that would be in my way of finding help and support.

I gave someone I love PTSD. Then found out I have CPTSD.,"I got divorced around 6 months ago.  My ex wife told me at the beginning that she had PTSD.  Specifically that I gave her PTSD.  

It really messed ME up because I really love her and never thought of myself as an “abuser.”  

Since then, I have been sober 4 months.  Done 5 months of therapy and had several Psychiatrist appointments.  I found out that I have CPTSD.  Which I didn’t even know was a thing.  I didn’t know a lot about a lot of mental health conditions.

I’m sure this will not go over well…but I never thought of my behavior as abusive.  Because I compared it to the abusive behavior that I had experienced in my life.

This whole experience has taught me a lot about trauma.  Specifically that trauma is a very individual experience.  There’s no “better” or “worse” it’s all in the eye of the beholder.  

It kind of makes me head hurt.

I pop my trunk and hand him a gas can, ask him to please fill his car so I can leave. He started fooling with the can, saying it “won’t work.” I get frustrated and end up pouring it into his tank for him. He drove off but something still feels so…. Off about it.

I don't know why I keep getting assaulted.,"Ok, I thought it might be good to get it all out somewhere. **TRIGGER WARNING TRIGGER WARNING This is really detailed, with some descriptions of abuse.** Please don't read if it will trigger you. I'm really sorry if it makes you uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

First, sometime before 5 I was repeatedly sexually abused/assaulted. I don't know what actually happened, I don't remember any of it. I just know that by the time I was 5 I had knowledge of what porn is and what sex toys are/how to use them, and I have memories of me asking my friends if they knew what grown men looked like naked. The only reason I know anything happened for sure is due to another situation I'll explain later on.

&#x200B;

When I was 6, my friend started doing things to me like looking up my skirt and trying to stick her hands in my underwear, to the point of chasing me into rooms when I would try to run away from her. I would have to block myself in closets and bathroom stalls and scream at the top of my lungs to get her to go away. I feel bad now because I know that she was probably being abused at home, but idk it scared me at the time.

&#x200B;

From the time I was little to until I was about 9, I couldn't go to any sort of family reunion without get sexually harassed/abused. It was mostly by older, distant relatives who I didn't know very well, but there was always something happening to me (though it never really went as far as full-blown rape or even really assault). I would tell my mom, sometimes in tears, and she would just brush it off as them making me (an already squeamish, shy girl) uncomfortable when they would literally be touching me or flashing me or sticking their crotches in my face. It was disgusting. My narc uncle also groomed me and got me to touch him sexually when I was about 9-10.

&#x200B;

On a trip my family took to a campground when I was almost 7, I kept following this group of older boys (about 9-12) around. I thought they were cool and they mostly took me under their wing, until one day three of them and I were looking for frogs in the forest and they assaulted me. The only way I got them to stop was by peeing myself, which got on their hands. It made me feel proud then for defending myself but grossed out and humiliated as I got older.

&#x200B;

When I was 10, I was groomed online by someone whose real age I still don't know (first they said they were 11, then 16, then idk). They would pressure me into sending them sexual things and acting out scenarios with them through text and this online game we met on (not gonna say the actual name cuz it's embarrassing). The scenarios would involve sexual assault and pedophilia and made me uncomfortable but they would just keep asking and saying they would report me until I did. Finally I broke it off and they threatened to doxx me. They sent me my own ip address over and over before I blocked them.

&#x200B;

When I was 11-12, I made friends with this kid in my class. I felt bad for him because nobody else would be his friend, though now I can see that was for a good reason. He had an IEP due to his Conduct Disorder (and was held back two years) so he got a pass out of gym and got the teacher to let me skip gym as well to ""study"" with him. For some reason, we would be unsupervised for long periods at a time (I think because the school thought it would be fine if I was there since I was a good student), and during those times he would repeatedly harass me and threaten me.

He would make me play computer and board games where he would make his character rape my character, he would try to force me to touch him sexually and he would touch me over my underwear/clothes. The kid would also follow me around and try to get me to have sex with him, whispering in my ear and disrespecting my personal space even in front of all my friends. He spread rumours that we were having sex and told me to just get it over with since everybody thought so already. He also said that none of the teachers would believe me if I told them what was going on because he was technically disabled. I'm almost certain now that the kid was some sort of psychopath.

&#x200B;

I'm 15 now. I just want to be okay. This isn't even all of it, there are more instances of me being harassed. I live in a big city so I've been stalked/followed, I've had creepy encounters on the street, I've been groped in passing. I also got a job this past summer and was harassed by my boss at the job.

All of these instances of abuse have really affected the way I see my body (I'm completely afraid of/repulsed by it lol), my ability to form new relationships, and just the way I see the world/other people. I'm also terrified of most men.

"Family was narcissistic, contemptuous, abusive, manipulative, critical and showed no support.

I get what Springsteen has said about our job is to honor our parents and not take their struggles and shortcomings further into the generations, but I good deal of that is internal acceptance and decisions about how you conduct yourself, and not necessarily letting the wolf you grew up with back onto the farm, just because you grew up with the wolf.

My therapist supports a respectful and detached distance between me and my family (of origin), which I tend to agree with.

No, they can't. They COULD tell something is off or that you are unhappy or nervous, but not why or what happened to you or what your diagnosis is.

I’m really, really confused & I don’t know what I could do to clean this up or tell him I haven’t asked him to hold anything.

"Magic can't fix ptsd, why do I even have to say this...","It's fine to be religious, but for fucks sake astrology, crystals, manifesting, aliens, rituals to contact supernatural beings will NOT fix PTSD.  You won't believe how many people tell me it can...

Side note, mods be aware that there are recruiters for alternative faiths on here trying to take advantage of desperate people. It's not any better than when Christians tell suffering people to find Jesus...

I know it can be tempting to ascribe supernatural characteristics to things in order to cope, but magic isn't real. There aren't aliens, angles, and energies waiting to heal you. 

It's okay to be desperate. I'm desperate. We're all desperate. It's okay to believe in alternative religion, but don't mistake it as the way people need to heal. Even if that stuff helps you cope, it's at the cost of seeing things for what they are.

Suddenly going emotionally numb while crying?,"I’ve realised that when I do cry about my trauma or anything related to my trauma, i maybe sob for like 30 seconds and feel a yawn coming, and then my emotions kinda just get switched off as if as easily as the flip of a switch, and i stop crying immediately. Not even the sniffles, I just completely stop and turn off. It has made it really hard to process my trauma and i minimise my trauma because of it, because I feel like a fake if I can just flip the switch off just like that. My chest just goes empty too as if I’m over it, or like I never thought much of it in the first place (which is not true because I feel a lot of pain and grief from it that usually kickstarts my crying).

"I can’t accept what happened as trauma because other people have it worse, please help me understand","
I was exposed to domestic violence throughout my entire childhood, watching my dad beat up my brother (who was the only real friend I had, I was so alone as a child), starve him and he would always verbally abuse all of us. My mom would never say anything I think she also hated my brother. When I was 10, I accidentally realised he is actually my cousin and not my brother (no one ever cared to explain this to me), he then left us and eventhough I see him now, we never lived as a family again. 
eventhough I think these series of events is what gave me borderline personality disorder later in life and feelings of constant guilt; I have a hard time accepting this as a trauma that happened to me, because my brother suffered the most and also in general people who are traumatised have been through much worse. Please help me

moving in with fiance w/ PTSD,"Hi all,

I want to start off by saying the my fiance is actively putting in the effort to go to therapy, see a psychiatrist, go on walks, eat 3 meals, etc. She is a victim of captivity, sexual abuse, and torture by an ex. When we talk torture we're not talking beatings but as being treated as a ""mutt"", eating off the floors, leashes, and a lot of other shitty stuff.

I've known this, have been there through highs and lows and still love her so finally asked her to marry me. Though she said yes, she's also terrified of me living with her and seeing her is her ""worst"" state (she unfortunately doesn't feel safe with others in her living space as her ex invaded her old apt). Until now, I've only interacted with her flashbacks and dissociation over the phone because she let me help but couldn't stand me in her space during those times. I understand.

But now that we're planning on living together she's starting to worry about how it'll go down when I inevitably live in the same space as her. I'm more than happy and honored to be able to help and support her. My own therapist is advising that I don't treat her as a patient but as a loved one. I get it. My fiance doesn't expect me to be there for her as well.

But I want to be prepared for the worst. Google is terrible by just saying talk gently and be there. But what are some of your personal ways of defusing or coming out from episodes?

I'm thinking of things like sensory toys and weighted blankets stationed around the house, ice packs, some bookmarked animal documentaries.

But what are some others? She and I are both open to trying stuff out until something that works comes up.

Tell me what your dream set up would be for a partner and your home. I want to make a space where she is free to go through an episode with no judgement, but abundant resources to overcome the inevitable flashbacks and dissociation happenings.

Thanks in advance!

UPDATE: I'm saying this often but you survivors are my heroes. You've been through things no human should ever experience yet here you are living, breathing,  TEACHING me. You're likely sick of hearing that you're strong but holy smokes you all are so so so so phenomenal. Really hope the present and future holds the best for you. 

UPDATE 2: while I very much appreciate all the compliments and thanks for being there for my fiance, I don't feel comfortable taking credit. 1. All humans should make an effort to learn ways of helping others and 2. I wouldn't have been able to learn and care for folx if all you survivors (including my fiance) didn't speak up, advocated for yourselves, and shared a piece of you with others.

My husband is the only one who can still touch me without me wanting to scream because my nervous system reacts so violently to this.

PTSD from riots. Feeling so alienated,"I live in a city where there was significant rioting at the end of May. I was present some nights of protesting and rioting, and live in the neighborhood where riots occurred. the area I live in is also low income, has a lot of homeless people and encampments that the cops keep sweeping. It's been pretty miserable and things are only getting worse. Ever since the riots I've been on edge waiting for there to be more protests around me.

I live near a hospital with a helipad and when the helicopters get too loud I freak out. Last night a shit ton of cop cars were lined up outside my house getting ready to arrest protesters. I could hear them joking around in their cars from my porch. I can see everyone around me on edge. At some point it hit me how fucking hard it is to live this way.

The protesters never made me feel unsafe. Even people rioting and looting didn't worry me that much. It was the fucking nazis running around and the cops tear gassing me and my friends and laughing while they bulldoze tents.

And I have to go about my life like everything is normal. I work as a college TA and I feel so disconnected from everyone. It feels like they've been living in a completely different city from me these last three months. I can't even give a fuck about COVID anymore. I feel like I couldn't even begin to tell most people everything that happened to me this summer. Like they wouldn't even believe me or if they did they'd be horrified.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the kind words and advice. I was hesitant to post because I know that the critics of these protests can be quite loud, but I'm very pleased that there were very few ass holes (one got deleted by a mod before I even saw it, thanks for that). I'm feeling much better than I did when I made this post, I was really shaken by all the cops outside my house and once I was able to be alone with my thoughts I lost it for a bit.

RE: Therapy I definitely have reservations about it for a number of reasons but I'll definitely be looking into some work I can do on my own and possibly EMDR since I've had it recommended before. I've said this to people before but as horrific as things have been I am still SO lucky to have a safe home to live in, stable income, and a very strong support network of close friends. I had a few IRL friends reach out to me because they could tell I was struggling.

I do hope that reading this gave some people who weren't close to any riots some perspective on how damaging the current state of affairs is. I am not the only one who feels this way. I'm white, I've only had to experience this kind of violence very recently, I can't imagine growing up with this level of fear.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/izyzod/ptsd_from_riots_feeling_so_alienated/,PTSD

I thought he moved. I guess not. Anyways, his cousin was in line for food and I scooted to the back with what I thought was without him seeing me.  I guess not. First thing this morning he’s here with his cousin. There are two sides to my restaurant, a dessert and lunch side and then my restaurant so luckily we weren’t open yet but the other side was.

Having PTSD is like being afraid of ice cream...,"I’ve been thinking of how to explain what PTSD is for me, and I thought I would share.

Having PTSD is like being afraid of ice cream. You LIKE ice cream. You WANT ice cream. Most of the time, when you think of ice cream, you have positive happy feelings. You look forward to it.

But because of PTSD, sometimes, you irrationally fear ice cream. Sometimes, when someone offers you ice cream, you become SO AFRAID and you don’t know why. So afraid that you can’t think. Sometimes ice cream makes you want to throw up. You want run away at the sight of ice cream. You want to CRY because that’s how scared you are. Your brain goes, what am I doing?! I like ice cream. I’ve been craving ice cream. And yet here I am, running out of the door when I see ice cream. Shoving it back in your face. Getting angry at you, because I’m convinced this ice cream is poisoned, even without proof, because it was once before. Blacking out if I try to eat it. Going completely numb.

Even when you’re experiencing it, it doesn’t make sense. It makes no more sense than fearing ice cream. It’s like there’s you, then there’s the ice cream, then there’s a third version of you which is PTSD, standing in your way. And it is a bummer, because you’re over here having panic attacks while other people are happily enjoying their ice cream. That is what PTSD is to me - liking ice cream, but also fearing ice cream, and never knowing which way you will feel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/8gse7u/having_ptsd_is_like_being_afraid_of_ice_cream/,PTSD

It's already broken and the war doesn't help in the slightest, but now a civil one? Which he sorta had coming, so it is in a way hilarious. I mean, it's not, it really is not, but you know what I mean? I am in a history textbook in a worst possible way and I can't stop feeling guilty for worrying about it because I'm not in Ukraine and therefore I don't have a right.

.I'm not sure where to go so I made this reddit account. Thought maybe righting it down and getting out would help? I (enby24) always knew I grew up different but I just realized a lot of my mothers ""lessons in self love"" were abuse. Her teaching me how to/having me help her pick out lingerie and taking pictures of her wearing it wasn't okay at all. Especially not for a child who was under the age of 10 (I don't even remember the exact age it's just something I remember growing up doing) and I always thought that was totally normal. When she abandoned me at 10 it only got worse. My father began hyperfixating on me. When we argued he would say ""were just like an old married couple"" and he would always refer to me as ""his little house wife that would never leave him"" and always buy me really nice gifts and asked for Goodnight kisses and lot of hugs, always wanted me to sit on his lap ect ect. When I was 15 he started calling me sexy and started stalking me (I once caught him outside my friends house and he would sit in the parking lot across from my job and watch me, sit in the school parking lot for hours, tried to put cameras in my bedroom and bathroom) and used to say he wanted to lock me in a tower so I could never leave him and I always felt like he wasn't really joking. he never did/asked for any of those things from my 4 brothers, and in fact told them all many times he wanted to send them to military school/couldn't wait for then to move out. It finally elevated when I was 18 and he told me he was in love with me. Had written me a love note and told me how amazing and incredible I was and how I would be the perfect wife. I ran away and never came back. But now in relationships I realize whenever I start feeling sad/down/like the person I'm with might want to leave me I realize that I get really desperate for sex to the point where if I get turned down I break down for days, convinced I'm unlovable and useless. I'm in therapy for all this but honestly? Some days are just tough and I just realized this weekend that all of that was sexual abuse and that the periods I go through of being hyper sexual are a result of that.

"i think something happened to me as a child, but i cannot remember?","Okay so basically, when i was 4 years old i was completely toilet trained and had just stopped bed wetting. my family went on a holiday to south africa where my parents had parties with many random strangers and drugs involved. i know that one night, there was a blackout and my mum told me she can’t remember what happened because she was on acid and so was my dad. i came back from this trip and began bed wetting and wetting my pants every single day. this went on for years because i simply didn’t have any ‘sensation’ when i needed to go to the bathroom, it just came when it wanted. this resulted in me being bullied for most of my primary school years making me isolate myself from the rest of the world. at this point, all i could remember from that trip to south africa was these blue bedsheets and how dark it was, but i never questioned that until now. also, growing up i struggled with very sexual intrusive thoughts that i thought were normal at the time, but i have come to learn since that it isn’t normal for a 6 year old to be having fantasies about being sexually assaulted as how would a child even know what that is? i believe in my heart that something happened to me on that trip, but i feel like i can’t tell anyone because they won’t believe me as i can’t exactly remember. as i’ve gotten older, more memories have surfaced of shadow figures and someone standing over me, but i’m unsure if it’s just my mind playing tricks on me or if what i’m remembering is real. i’m writing this to let this out as i’ve held onto this for so long and have nobody in my life who i feel will believe me if i tell them

20 Fast interventions for panic and dissociation.,"**Body**

1. **Choose a particular group of muscles and try to maintain awareness of them despite the panic or dissociation. Tense them as tightly as you can and then force them to relax. Stay with the experience of the muscle group trying to relax.** 
2. **Choose a food with a strong flavor like mint, chocolate, cheese, or a pickle. Hold the food on your tongue and stay mindfully aware of the sensation of taste. Notice how different parts of your tongue taste different flavors.**
3. **Find something with a strong texture, like a soft blanket or a cool stone. Feel the item and be mindful of the experience. Try and pull yourself back into the world around you through the connection.** 
4. **Smell a strongly scented item, like peppermint oil or a scented candle. If possible choose a scent that reminds you of a pleasant place or memory. Try and reconnect with your senses and your environment by experiencing the strong smell. Notice what the smell makes you think about or feel in your body.**
5. **Laying under an “anxiety” blanket or weighted blanket can be a stimulating somatic experience. If you don't have one, try lying under several heavy blankets to slow your heart rate and calm down.** 
6. **Rub a mentholated lotion around the neck and chest when you notice panic starting. There are many brands like Blue Stop ™ that are marketed for arthritis and muscle pain. The cooling sensation can help you reconnect with your body and slow your heart rate.** 
7. **Wrap a frozen bag of peas in a towel and put it across your forehead and eyes. This will activate the body’s natural “dive response”.  When the head becomes colder than the rest of the body, your body thinks it is diving into deep water and will slow your heart rate and relax muscles to save oxygen.**

# Mind

1. **Make a mantra about the fear, negative belief, or trigger for your panic or dissociation. This should be something that reminds you that you are ok and that the belief about the trauma is not true right now. Eg. “I am safe, I am free” or “my past is not my future” or “I am loving, I am loved”. Repeat the mantra to yourself when you notice the distressing belief taking hold.** 
2. **Break down what you are currently doing into a series of steps, and repeat back to yourself the steps of what you are doing in a deconstructed way. Remember that you are competent and that these are easy things to do. Eg. “I am turning on my blinker at the intersection” or “I am putting peanut butter on the bread”.**
3. **Go through your phone or a mental calendar of future events and realize that this moment is just one part of the rest of your life. Go through your schedule and realize that right now is just one minute of the next hour of the next day of the next week of the next year. Think about things that you are excited to do in the future. Think of ways you can prepare for them.** 
4. **Try and put your finger on the exact emotions that you are feeling. “Overwhelmed” or “freaked out” are not emotions. Try and specifically describe your experience. Ask yourself if your current reality necessitates this experience. Try and discover if you are feeling scared, vulnerable or angry in this moment. If so, try and figure out who or what you are directing these emotions toward.**  
5. **The “stuck memory” of the trauma remembers the muscle groups that were tightened during the trauma. It remembers the way that you wanted to move your body's posture to protect yourself. Most importantly it remembers the way that you felt about yourself during the trauma. you may have wanted to curl up into a ball or stand up and fight. You may have thought that you were dirty, weak, small, or foolish. remind yourself that the traumatic belief you had about yourself during the trauma is not true. Also, try and move your posture into the opposite position the trauma belief makes it want to move into. Relax all muscle groups that want to tighten.**

# Soul 

1. **Think of an object or a place that you find beautiful. Look up a picture on your phone if you have access to one. Think about what you find beautiful about this object or place. Notice all of the things that you appreciate about the beauty of this place or object. Eg. pictures of the beach or a famous painting or sculpture** 
2. **Think about someone you love and feel safe with.  Think about what it is that you love about them. Think about this person and try and cultivate compassion for them. Feel yourself move from isolation to connection, and fear to compassion. If a word or phrase jumps out at you that represents this relationship to you, then repeat it to yourself in your head. Eg. Trust, kindness, safety**
3. **Think of your whole life like a giant web. Imagine yourself at the center and the strands of the web as your connections to others. Think of all the people that you love. Imagine where they are right now and when you will see them again. Imagine that the strings of the web run out from you to where your loved ones are in the world..** 
4. **Creativity requires us to get outside our own immediate experiences and reconnect with our resilient self. Draw a picture with anything you have, pen and napkin or toe in the dirt. Think about how you want to feel and try and express that feeling however you can. Hum a tune or sing a song if that is more appealing to you. When you feel that you are out of the immediate experience of the panic or dissociation, do a more complex creative activity that you find healing. Bake a cake, paint pictures, write a short poem, or make yourself do a small home improvement project. Reconnecting with our creative image and spatial processing part of the brain allows us to draw new connections and create new learned experience that helps us process trauma.** 
5. **Go to a space that you find calming, spiritual, or that feeds you in a personal way. Walk in the woods, sit by a lake, bird watch, attend a religious service, watch a theater piece, or go for a scenic drive. Find a space where you feel like you are calm, safe, and can start to be yourself again.**  
6. **Try to find your center or mindful self during the experience of the panic or dissociation. Think about the essence, psyche, or soul of yourself as a person. Feel how this anxiety, panic and dissociative episode is holding you back from being present like you would like to be. Ask yourself, what in me do I need to leave behind so the rest of me can become what I want to be? Ask yourself, what enlarges what I am, and what restricts who I am? Visualize yourself taking off or moving away from the anxiety experience. Realize that it is hurting you and not helping you right now. Try and feel yourself leave some of it behind so your mindful self can become more present.**

Anyone else get triggered and feel unsafe around unorganized/spontaneous people?,"Anyone else get triggered and feel unsafe around unorganized/spontaneous people?

I am actually technically an ENFP so at my core, I can be pretty spontaneous, unpredictable, and disorganized myself. However, my manager part (Internal Family Systems Part) is very organized, impatient, efficient, logical and perfectionistic. My manager comes out frequently when I need to protect myself and take control of myself and surroundings. At this time in my life, I notice I feel triggered and unsafe around people and especially those who are supposed to take care of me when they are disorganized and unpredictable. I need to know they have my back and can catch me if I fall. I crave calm, logical, organized, and predictable people. I cannot stand when I am around people who are indecisive and make decisions in a flash based on their feelings. I notice I feel a lot of anxiety in relationships with people like this as it triggers my insecure attachment. 

I have learned that people with a traumatic background often benefit from structure and stability to assist in regulating emotions. Recently, I have had some bad experiences with my surgeon and therapist that makes me distrust their expertise. They both are laid back, unorganized and forgetful. When I notice these traits, my manager comes out and takes the role of being the organized person. I feel stressed and hypervigilant doing this as it is not even who I truly am at my best as an ENFP. I feel annoyed and impatient around them as they appear lazy and passive. I feel like I do not trust them to take care of me due to their qualities such as not calling me when they said they would. I know this is definitely related to my trauma background where my abusers were often unpredictable and you never knew what their next move would be so you had to be on edge and hypervigilant. I wonder if I should switch therapists because when I take on the manager role, it gets in the way of me doing EMDR because my exile has a hard time coming out when my manager is so present. 

I know no one is perfect and they have traits that very logical people lack such as gentleness and warmth. But I really think I thrive when people can balance me out and I feel safer when my doctors are more logical and organized. I also know once I heal more from my trauma,  I will be able to feel less triggered and unsafe around people with these qualities. 

 I really struggle with working with people like this! Does anyone else relate?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/cpdzvg/anyone_else_get_triggered_and_feel_unsafe_around/,PTSD

"To the guy on here that posted that anyone with non combat related ptsd are pansies and should stfu, you are wrong and here is why","(This is super long)

You know, I've never fully revealed on here why I have PTSD. I've just given the gist. But let me tell you my story, and why don't you tell me if I can ""Just get over it"" and ""my ptsd is not real ptsd""

My story starts with my high school sweetheart. Together since 16 and we married as soon as I turned 18. But when we got married, things started to change. Little things. He would become jealous when he wasn't previously a jealous person. He started to be controlling. Then he started to get angry. Then one day, I don't remember the reason, but it was when the physical violence started. He choked me until I passed out. I thought maybe this was a one time thing. But no. Stupid scared and naive 18yo me wanted to make a marriage work. His jealously became worse and he stared to hit me when we argued, over the most trivial things I might add (like who ate the last doughnut), he would hit me for that too. He'd grab my arm so hard there'd be bruises where his fingers were pressing. He constantly tried to convince me that we should kill ourselves together. 

Then, 3 months into our marriage, I had the worst experience of my life. He had gotten mad at me for spending too long over at a friends house and accused me of seeing another guy there. So he put me in ""the hole"". In our house, there was a loose board in the stairs that you could pry open, revealing the ground underneath the stairs. He put me in the hole and the other stair boards were nailed in, I was too short to reach the lose one. He left me in there for 3 days with no light. He would only open the board to throw water and granola bars at me, and occasionally try to urinate on me. I sat in that hole in the corner for 3 days and nights. I screamed but no one could hear. Finally, he pulls up the board and pulls me out. He tells me to get cleaned up and hurry, I have 10 minutes. It turns out, my parents had just called him and said they were coming to stay the weekend with us. I was too scared to tell them and I am ashamed of that. 

The night they left, I asked him if he would get off of the computer so I could use the phone to call my (gay) best friend (we had dialup). He then became angry. He flipped the computer table and it fell to the ground. He accused me of cheating on him with my gay friend, that he wasnt really gay and that we had been having an affair and playing him for a fool all along.

I had never seen him this angry, so I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in. Thankfully my cell phone was in there and I called my gay friend (who lived a block away) And i told him that it was bad and was scared and to get a friend (Brad) to come over and help me. Well husband broke down the bathroom door (he was 6'5 250lbs) and pulled me out to the living room. He told me to sit on the couch while he went to get something. I ran to my room but he caught me before I got there. He dragged me on the floor by my hair back to the living room. He had gotten a shotgun and he pointed it at me and he told me that he was going to kill me and then kill himself. At this moment, (I found out later that my gay friend and Brad had peeked through the window and saw husband with the gun) Brad opens the door really fast. Husband happened to be standing close enough to it that it hit him in the back and it knocked him over. Brad took me by the hand and we left. I have never seen my husband again.

So there is my story of why I have PTSD.  I want you to tell me now if my PTSD isn't ""real"" PTSD because I wasn't in combat.

To the guy who posted, you are a fool. Combat veterans arent the only people in the world that have PTSD. And for you to make a post suggesting that anyone with ""childhood trauma"" doesn't really have PTSD and should just deal with their problems like adults, you make me sick.

I was told that my PTSD is too severe and I need a specialist ,"I finally worked up the courage (and money) to go see a doctor and find out if I could get prescribed something. ANYTHING. She said she was sorry but couldn’t lie to me, my issues are far outside her range of expertise. I had just gone over with the nurse what I was dealing with and wiped my tears before the doctor came. I then burst into tears out of frustration when she gave me her answer. I paid $171 out of pocket just to see her. I asked her “Did I just spend close to $200 just to be told you can’t help me?”. I think she was going to pocket my money but I walked out and I asked for a refund. I feel soooo defeated. I’ve been struggling for years and I cannot afford a specialist. All of the psychiatrists (well 4 psychs, 3 therapists and 1 specialist) I’ve seen since I was 22 did not take insurance. They said the insurance companies caused so many problems that they just stopped accepting it. Something has got to give. I’m 31 and my trauma has only been compounded by a recent violently abusive relationship. I have no one to help me or even a shoulder to cry on. This is exhausting. I did make a call to a ketamine clinic and so I’m hoping I can maybe get some help there because as long as my insurance is accepted my sessions will be way cheaper than I expected. But out of pocket is over a $1000. Idk I just needed to vent and cry a little. The American health care system is more than a joke, it’s a scam.

"I have diagnosed PTSD, but the triggering event ended with everyone being safe, and it makes me feel guilty and stupid, but I am nearly not able to function.","Hi all - To keep it short, I had to save my young son (7) from a rogue wave set that tore him off the beach in Hawaii a couple years ago. It took \*every. single. bit\* of everything I had to do it. At one point I made my peace and was on my way to accepting that I wasn't gonna make it, but I would be damned if he wasn't.   


We both made it out. I don't really know how, but we did, and neither of us needed medical treatment, but I wasn't ok. Immediately I knew I wasn't ok.   


I have been on meds (the nightmares, oh my god the nightmares), I have done EMDR, and both have helped, but it always feels like it wears off.   


I don't want to leave my house. Hell, I don't want to leave my room. I am constantly just waiting for the next bad thing.   


I feel like my friends and family, who have been very supportive, esp my loving wife, are growing tired of me. But I can't explain it, I don't want to do anything. I seem to be slipping into lower and lower power states, where normal things seem too hard to deal with, and I put off things until they are either about to go wrong, or right after. I can't seem to do anything that would ""save"" me from additional issues, money, time, whatever - and the worst part is I KNOW I need to do them and its like I handcuffed.   


Then on top of it all, I feel like a fraud. Like a charlatan. There are so many persons that are fully entitled to their PTSD due to the horrific things that have happened to them. I feel so stupid for mine, like its stolen valor.

I'm not a veteran but I was wondering if it's okay I post here?,"Im not a veteren, I devolped my PTSD at 13 & was diagnosed at 15. If I'm not suppose to be posting here I'm really sorry. I don't want to be insensitive or intrude on a space for such a serious disorder as I'm sure many here have survived much worse things and I sometimes feel selfish(?), or maybe wrong(?) to say I'm struggling with my PTSD or ask for help like many of you all because of some survivor guilt & fear of fire.

I turned 26 this year. Really no big deal at all other then I feel like I wasted the last few years. As im sure many of you can relate to having, I'm having a particularly tough day. Just a lot of thinking, a bit too much honestly. Mostly about how I'm not happy with who I've become. What I've done. The choices I've made, & am I really allowed to be upset about the consequences of my own actions? When it hit me.

By the end of this year I will have lived more years **with** PTSD then without. That thought killed me. I've always had trouble with remembering a lot of what happened before the fire. The good & the bad. Better or worse. I know these are repressed memories & not forgotten. That they can be gotten back. 

Yet I'm starting to feel like I've forgotten who I was before I had PTSD. I can feel these beautiful moments & old version myself slipping away, & it feels as if I'm holding on to them by barbed wire. I do everything I can to pull them close enough only to find they're to shredded to make out. & It feels as if I did more damage to myself then good. But I'm so scared to let them go.

I don't expect anyone to have any answers. To be honest I'm not really sure who or why I'm writing all this. Again I'm really sorry if this is the wrong sub.

How do you explain to somebody that loud noises are a PTSD trigger without explicitly telling them you have PTSD?,"Basically the title.

I'm currently an intern at a metal processing company. Due to the nature of my position I'm in close proximity to the tension testing machine. I've tried tension testing the last time I interned here and kinda, sorta made it work but the distress it caused me bubbled over into my private life.

Last week I was supposed to do it again, but had to fight to keep down a panic attack and asked my coworker if he could complete it. I just got asked why I can't do it this time and just gave some vague answer. I feel really bad for not being able to do it and I kinda do want to give an explanation but this feels way too personal to discuss it with someone I'll never see again in a couple of days.

being gaslighted by my therapist?,"tw- mentioning sa, nothing graphic or specific 

recently, i’ve really felt like i’m being gaslighted by my therapist.

we’ve been doing trauma therapy for a few years now and i’ve recently decided i’d like to take a break and focus on my current life. since then, i’ve really felt like he’s gaslighting me.

first, he keeps bringing up my trauma and asking if it “really happened” i never know what to say when he asks. sure, healthy skepticism is valid, but he’s my therapist i’ve been working with for years and it feels like a betrayal of trust. 

i told his yesterday “i feel like you don’t believe me” and his response was “no. i believe you more than you believe yourself” which felt like he was lying. if he wasn’t then why has he repeated asked me if i was faking? 

he’s frankly asked some really out there questions too. he think i should get a hymen check to prove what really happened happened. that made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable because a) i’m not even pursing legal action against my abusers at the moment b) hymen checks aren’t a good indication of sexual abuse and c) he should believe me unless i say otherwise. i even told him that was out of line and he said it was “just a thought”

when he makes me uncomfortable or pushes me to speak about something when i don’t want to i tell him “i’m not ready to talk about this yet” and he told me “you’re going back to day one in therapy”

which is really, really ironic because day 1 me had no sense of boundaries and always let him drive the conversation. i’ve finally built the confidence to advocate my needs and he treats me like that’s a bad thing. it makes me feel like i should just listen to him because he knows best and maybe i’m wrong for speaking up. 

sorry this was so long. i just wanted advice from others if this is normal behavior for a therapist or if i’m being gaslighted. i don’t use the word gaslight lightly but he’s making me doubt my own reality and perception of what happened to me. 

does anyone have any thoughts or advice? it would be appreciated",https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/r5nktn/being_gaslighted_by_my_therapist/,PTSD
Is doubting own trauma common? TW: Abuse,"I need advice from objective people (tldr at bottom). 

Years ago I (M) said no to someone (F) who wanted to have sex with me. She asked and I said I wasn't comfortable with that. She asked again and I said I didn't want to. We were sitting down at the time. She got on top of me and I froze as she had sex with me. I didn't push her off. She tried to kiss me and I tried to turn away but was unable to. The whole thing was very brief. I didnt think too much about it for years after (i had the mindset of 'I am male so it isn't the same' ) and I have been on good terms with her since. 

I went for therapy a couple years ago and was diagnosed with PTSD. My therapist at the time focused a lot on why she acted she did at the time and in the years I've known this person I've learned she was sexually assaulted by guys before I knew her. Likewise I was sexually assaulted by an older boy when i was very young. I gradually began to understand why she acted the way she did and also why I froze (i was beaten up a lot as a kid too and i would always freeze then as well). To that end I hold no anger towards her, as she was a product of her suffering. It helped me move on for a time. She's changed. I've changed. We've grown and now we are supportive of each other. I have forgiven my other attackers as well as part of my own journey. 

The problem I have is that sometimes I doubt the whole thing and now I blame myself. Its like 'i hold no anger, i understand why she was like that' but now I question whether I was raped at all. 

**Tl:DR: **  I guess I'm just looking for a more objective outsider opinion: Given that I said I didnt want sex twice and then didnt fight back, I was still raped, right? Being on good terms now and understanding why that happened doesnt invalidate my experience does it? Is my self doubt just a part of the PTSD?

Anyone else have nightmares unrelated to their PTSD?,"For many years I had regular nightmares of being chased and just generally fighting for survival. Nowadays, I've made a ton of progress on my PTSD but I have the most random and fucked up nightmares sometimes.

Last night I had a nightmare where I watched someone get shredded alive slowly in some time of meat grinder type thing, intentionally from a bad guy. Flesh bits were flying everywhere and the screaming was horrific. That dream was followed by me being tortured and I only woke up because I was in so much pain.

I was never an angry person and I'm dealing with the fact my head compartmentalized things in such a way that when I observe myself now as a whole, I feel like I should recognize better when I feel angry and I'm doing things defensively. I tend to be oblivious of my faults at those times.
But on the other hand, if I focus on my faults I have a hard time speaking for myself because my head is 100% focused on ""I fucked up"", I can't place what the other person's done in perspective. I give up too much on myself.

I am starting to get angry at him,"I was violently raped 20 yrs ago and pushed it away for nearly 20 yrs. I barely felt anything about it or about him. Even though I was in the grip of a roaring case of undiagnosed PTSD. Now I have gone through a 6 week inpatient trauma treatment.  Even after that I felt nothing but compassion for my abuser... I always thought that he  didn’t realize how badly he was harming me, even though there was blood, even though I was saying, stop, you are hurting me. Even though he was lifting my body up off the couch with every blow of his fist. 

Two days ago I was triggered and had to ride out some horrendous flashbacks.  And for the first time, as I felt myself back in the bathroom where I had gotten away from him, where I was trying to stop the slow of blood, I felt anger toward him. I realized: this man knew EXACTLY what he was doing. He knew he was being violent, he knew he was harming me. And I was probably not the only woman he raped so viciously. For the first time I wanted to kick down that bathroom door and come back at him... I wanted to kick him and pummel him and claw his face and scream until he heard me. I wanted to beat him bloody. For the first time I did not excuse him.

I have a financially secure job and I go to work every day and not only try my best but actively try to get along with others and make people laugh every day. My coworkers like me, and some look up to me. No one would think I have any problems at all. However, I feel like I am hidden behind a veil, and when I come home from work and when I am in the privacy of my home, I am in such crippling depression. I have such terrible episodes of sadness. I hate myself. I over-analyze everything stupid I do or say throughout the day and I replay it in my mind constantly and belittle myself. I don't feel proud of myself for any of my accomplishments and genuinely don't know why anyone even likes me. And yet I still get up every day, live this routine, and put on a facade like I am okay.

I hate 'foggy brain syndrome',"Does anyone else feel like their mind isn't as sharp as it used to be? Back when I was a kid, I was actually able to focus on things and had a pretty good memory.

Finding a therapist, trialling multiple therapists to see which one suits me best, or even starting on antidepressants and having to check in with a doctor/psychiatrist every few weeks, or having to change medications because one might fuck up my head even more, or not even work... all takes so much fucking effort that I can't bother to do any of it.

I went to a counsellor at my university earlier this year, and they suggested things like group therapy for my anxiety and volunteering for causes because that can give people a sense of purpose in day to day life... and I just didn't know how to tell them, that is exactly the problem, *I have utterly no will to do any of that and that's why I'm sitting in your office right now and I don't know what anyone can possibly do about me being this way*.

If people with depression were able to so easily do things to help themselves, we wouldn't need to classify it as an 'illness' or 'disorder'. That's why it's so infuriating when we see how even 'professional' mental health advocacy organizations repeat the hackneyed slogans which I cannot understand how they are even still in mass circulation.

It's so irrational and frustrating that I'm physically able to take ten steps out of the house to just go on a goddamn walk, but I have absolutely no mental will to do anything but lie in bed. Only listening to music is the only action that can be done purely passively with no effort whatsoever, but then I just get sad and start spiralling from guilt. And I can't stop thinking about how irrational it is, even though I've experienced it for so many years. I'm constantly surprising myself from my own incompetence, as if I ever expected anything different.

More than hopelessness, I just feel confused as to what I'm supposed to do when I can't will myself to do anything. What even is this anymore?

"2 years since I dropped out of college due to anxiety and depression, I finally signed back up for classes yesterday.","I finally did it guys!!!!! 2 years!! 

I was so depressed 2 years ago I started skipping classes, I failed every single class I was in. My GPA dropped to a 1.7. I lost my financial aid, which I couldn't go back the next semester without.

I spent the last 2 years, becoming more and more depressed because I couldn't afford to go back and I ruined my life over depression. 

But I finally did it!!!! (with the consistent encouragement of my boyfriend who told me hes going to keep on top of my ass and I'm not allowed to skip class) I still have a year and a half left for my associate's because of how much I failed but it's a start.

Edit: I cant believe how many people replied to this!! Thank you all so much for encouraging me, to know I had 100+ people comment to tell me how proud they are makes me even more motivated to do well this semester.

The worst part of depression is that it's stolen my personality,"My actual personality is over the top, fun(in my opinion), confident, and kind. But the depression teams up with social anxiety so that I just don't have enough enough energy to act like who I truly am. I turn into this very flat, monotone, boring, quiet person who I would never want to hang out with or date.

It's the main reason I avoid social interaction now - it feels humiliating because I feel like I'm perceived as this pathetic, pitiable, ignorable person.

 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

Depression = Losing intelligence,"The worst part about depression for me, even worse than suicidal thoughts or constant pain, is the huge toll it has on my mental faculties. 

I think slower. I need longer for decision making and understanding pretty basic things in conversations. I can't plan anything because it is too much mental effort. I read a sentence in a book and don't register the information it's supposed to convey.

I can't think as deeply. As a teenager, I was able to hold my train of thought and look at a problem for a long time and find an intricate solution. That's gone. My ability to think any deeper than surface level is lost. 

I'm not improving my programming skills, even though I do it professionally on a daily basis. I just don't seem to have the mental capacity for improvement. 

It has been like that for years, even worsening, I'm worried that I'll just stay ""depression stupid"" forever. It's also completely ruining my future, because I can't make any sound decisions.

I (24 f) got dressed and did a bit of my makeup to meet up with a friend at a coffee shop. I’m in the middle of a depressive episode and dealing with some great difficulties in my personal life. She didn’t show up. This was my attempt to “reach out”.,"Update:

Sorry in advance, I’m on mobile and this is long. 
I really wasn’t expecting this amount of support and kindness from so many people. Thank you all for the uplifting words and thank you for the rewards! 

I’d like to first address any concerns about meeting up during the pandemic. My friend and I made plans to meet up at a coffee shop, buy a quick cup of coffee, and then immediately head to a park nearby in separate cars. The coffee shop is on small a military base so that cuts the amount of people that were in there down by a lot. I went ahead and grabbed coffee and then waited on a bench outside of the shop for around 30 minutes or so before leaving. I stayed 6 feet away from others and wore a mask the entire time. I played it safe and went by the rules.

Next I’d like to say thank you to those who have helped me realize how big of an accomplishment it was for me to get to the coffee shop. It really did take a lot of effort and I appreciate the reminder that it took strength I didn’t know I had. 

I also want to thank those who have expressed empathy towards my friend. She is going through a rough time and has been since long before the pandemic started. I wasn’t angry at her because I understand that she’s struggling too. I was just really sad and disappointed because I’ve only seen her once since last year. It was more of a bummer than anything and I just needed somewhere to get it off of my chest so I came to Reddit. Kind people of Reddit, you did not disappoint! 

I’m going to continue being her friend because she is very dear to me. Knowing the kind of person she is, she probably truly forgot, there was a potential miscommunication, or she may have had something come up that she couldn’t get out of. It would have been nice to get a bit of a heads up or an explanation, but I haven’t dwelled on it too much. She’ll reach out when she’s ready to. If not, then I understand that too. 

I’ve been in therapy and medication since 2018 and recently sent a cease &amp; desist letter and went no contact with my mother. As a result of that I haven’t heard from my Dad since it happened. I also live states away from my childhood friends and what’s left of the family that supports me (not many people). I’m better off being out of that toxic environment but it’s still a grief process losing people that are still alive. I have also been grieving what could have been if I only had healthy and supportive parents. 

I’m also struggling with my marriage. I’m a military spouse and it’s hard being so far away from the little support I have states away (my sisters). I won’t go into detail here about my rocky marriage but it’s been traumatic and hard. I haven’t gotten much support other than therapy and the support my younger sisters have been capable of giving. I’m in the process of filling out divorce papers and working with an attorneys office to explore my options. 

I also had surgery at the end of October to repair a hernia. It wasn’t too big of a deal, and my sisters came from out of town to visit during my recovery, but it did knock me down a bit emotionally because I was restricted from carrying anything over 20 pounds. That meant I couldn’t hold my toddler who is 30 pounds and that was really hard on both of us. 

It just would’ve been nice to be able to have hung out and talked to the one friend I have here about everything going on. It honestly would’ve been nice to talk about things that have nothing to do with all of the crap that has  gone on this year too. 

It’s okay though! Life will carry on and there will be better days. I still got my coffee, got outside, then came home and hung out with my son and put up Christmas decorations. 
I also got a ton of fantastic advise and support from you lovely folks. Thank you again!

TL;DR Thank you for the support and kind words! I’m not mad at my friend, just sad we couldn’t meet up. I followed social distancing rules when going out. 2020 has sucked but personally, so has the past decade or so.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jz3rhk/i_24_f_got_dressed_and_did_a_bit_of_my_makeup_to/,depression

"We only wish depression was being ""sad"".","But depression is much more than that. 

It’s the excuses you have to make when you can’t make that meeting. 

It’s the friends and family you’ve lost because you can’t explain why. 

It’s the opportunities that land in everyone else’s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It’s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It’s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It’s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It’s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It’s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. 

It’s the wall that blocked you off from life. 

It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. 

It’s not just being “sad”. And we can only wish it was.

"I'm black, I'm scared, tired and I'm at the end of my rope with life.","Jesus, how do I even start. As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

I'm very glad that I vented about all these feelings here with you all. I feel so much support from you and I feel like my feelings are valid and worth feeling. It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it.

An unexpected side effect of depression: the decline of cognitive capabilities,"This has been really scaring me lately. Since becoming depressed I've noticed more and more;

- an inability to maintain thoughtful conversations with people

- severely reduced attention span

- short term memory loss

- severely reduced motivation

I think it largely has to do with my partaking in escapism, as I spend much more time browsing reddit/youtube and getting high since when I actually try to focus on work I usually end up crying. The result seems to be a feeling like I've been living in a haze, like I'm never really fully aware of what's going on, I'm just passively going through the motions of life. 

Getting out of this rut is going to be so much harder than I thought. I literally feel stupider now that I've been depressed for months.

Being depressed and having depression are different.,"I have clinical depression. I was diagnosed about 5 years ago. It really hits me hard sometimes. One of my friends does not understand that people can 100% get depressed because of nothing. She thinks people only get depressed for a specific reason. Such as someone passing away, or a horrible break up. And those things are awful, those feelings are valid and the literal worst. But, she doesn’t understand that people can just be depressed for basically no reason at all. I’m currently having a depressive episode. Nothings wrong. I just can’t get out of bed... I can’t do the dishes. I can’t pick up the take-out off my bedroom floor. I can’t. 

I just.. I can’t hear the “but.. why are you depressed?” question one more time. Fortunately and unfortunately, I’ve been dealing with this illness for long enough that I know that this feeling will end, and I know how to somewhat manage it. But, if she were to say that to someone else.. I just worry that it could end someone’s life.

Then I get asked why I'm not at our parties, and my friends asking why I haven't been going to the gym with them. Then my parents asking why I'm spending money at Chipotle and Wendy's and shit like I'm supposed to be eating green ass shit from whole foods all day. Then I'm supposed to also be spending time playing sports and video games and reading bc apparently that's the shit I like to do. Fuck this. How is anyone supposed to do this?

I hate how fast I go from being okay to empty and depressed,"I was doing fine this past month, I’ve been getting up early and being productive and just being okay for once. I started talking to this girl and things were perfect, we have lots in common and we seem to be on the same boat on things. I haven’t been in a relationship in a while but she made it clear she wants to be with me in time. Yesterday I invited her to hang out with my friends and I and she was just so different than she is when we’re alone. When I tried to hold her hand she didn’t let me. Afterwards she texted me and said she’s not ready after all and realized it when I tried to show affection in front of my friends. We’ve only been talking for about 2 weeks so it didn’t completely destroy me, but I just always get attached quick so I’m still upset about it. It seems like every person I see myself with always tends to end things for one reason or another and I’m over it. 

Being a front line worker is exhausting as it is, but having a failed “almost relationship” again is messing with my head and I’m starting to feel the darkness overwhelm my thoughts when I’ve spent the majority of the last few years working on fixing that. It’s hard when I put all my effort into people that don’t do the same back. You know when you stare into nothing and start overthinking everything about your life? I’m starting to think I’m the problem behind all these failed relationships. I know she’s not worth it, I don’t think it’s her specifically making me feel this way as much as the patterns that keep occurring in my love life. I don’t know what to do anymore.

tdlr; things were fine until they weren’t and I just don’t know what to do anymore",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gnmp5u/i_hate_how_fast_i_go_from_being_okay_to_empty_and/,depression

I secretly hope that I will be diagnosed with a terminal illness so I can die without taking my own life,"Hey Reddit. Drunk me here, mainly looking to vent because I have noone else. No alts because fuck it, might dox myself.

Picture this, I met a woman. I fell in love. Hopelessly in love. Three years later, she gets pregnant. We were both young, and scared, but I tell myself I will do anything I can to make it work.

I have a baby. I cry. I promise MY baby girl the world, and the love I never had. But then things change.

The woman lives with her parents, I no longer can stay there with her and her family due to ""covid."" Okay thats fine. Go to the store? Quarantine for two weeks. Saw someone? Quarantine for two weeks. Quickly realized my opinion is not regarded about the baby. My input has no sway on how to raise her. Suddenly feel like a babysitter, I am ""allowed"" to come over after work, watch the baby, while her mom ignores me.

Eventually the woman I fell in love with starts being distant. It's little things at first. She doesn't want to cuddle. She stops kissing me. She stops inviting me to things. Then she tells me she's gay.

I decide I can make it work right? I love this woman! She says she wants to be with me still? I'll make it work of course. But then she starts antagonizing me. Insinuating I am a bad father for not being there full time for the baby when I dont have a choice. Ignoring me. Arguing with me.

I am... heartbroken. I don't know how else to describe it. I can't help but ask myself if I did something wrong. I keep telling myself I can make this work but it only gets worse. I have recently fallen into the worst depression of my life. I have had a couple suicide attempts in the past, the only thing stopping me now is knowing I would be leaving my baby girl without a father.

I dont know what to do. I donf know what this post was to accomplish. Maybe to rant? Get this off my chest? Who knows. I sure don't.

Edit: I barely remembered making this post. Was too afraid to look at the replies for awhile but I'm glad I did.

My therapist gave me an advice that I wanted to share,"As a part of my mental illness, I suffer from strong self doubts and feelings of being worthless. And I often got told that if I have these, I need to think very positively about myself and realise that these thoughts aren't true. But it never worked, my negativity is way too strong to be able to habe any positive thoughts about myself, let alone to have stronger positive than negative thoughts.

So my current therapist suggested another approach. She said, instead of forcing myself to think positive, I should try to not evaluate myself at all for a certrain time. Neither negatively nor positively (though the second is rather rare anyway). What this does is that it gives some distance to the negative thoughts and therefore breaks that cycle of depression where depression makes me have negative thoughts and the negative thoughts make me depressed.

This is way easier because I just have to be neutral instead of positive and I notice what she means with breaking the cycle. I hope that this might help someone here.

I feel like depression makes me more stupid,"Like it's harder for my brain to work.  Like I'm in the middle of a fog.  I make stupid mistakes at work.  I wonder if I'm mentally handicapped.  I have thoughts of, what if I'm no longer mentally able to do my job?  That scares me.

As much in pain as I am right now I am so grateful.  Because until now I was missing a huge understanding of my condition.  A doctor once told me I was ""living in a dark room.""  Well part of that dark room was not understanding the mental handicaps, and possible permanent loss of function, that go along with this disease.

"My friend attempted suicide a couple days ago. My family is saying I will ""ruin Christmas"" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?","A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition.

"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,depression

"I’m 19, my girlfriend was murdered, the trial is soon and I’m getting more and more depressive","Hi y’all,
Well I'm not used to posting on forums but I feel so bad atm and I can't open up about this to my family, my friends or my therapist even if they want that, I feel completely unable to talk about it with them.
I’m a 20yo man. I‘m Irish but my family moved to France when I was 5 and that is where I have lived since.
I grew up in a small country village, the school had only two classes. I hardly spoke French but I got a friend very quickly, I’ll call her Honey in this post.
 So Honey and I were friends all our childhood, we were in the same class every year and we were also neighbors so we played together every day after school. Year after year I became bilingual in French and made lots of friends, but I started to have a crush on her.
When I was 11 we started middle school, we were still in the same class and all our classmates were trying to get us together, but we were pretty shy at that time so we didn't dare to « flirt ». Finally it was the following year, when I was 12 years old, that we got in relationship. Ofc the feelings I had for her weren’t as strong as those I had for her when we grew up up because we were still young but I was so happy.  She was the first girl I kissed, the only one actually.
We kept growing up, we were always in the same class every year and we kept spending all of our time together. If I explain that, it’s so that you understand that from my 5 to 19 years I almost spent every day of my life with her, she gradually became as essential as breathing for me. The more the years went by, the more « serious » (important to each of us) our relationship became. We never argue, ofc sometimes we didn’t agree with each other but we knew how to put our differences aside and respect the point of view of the other.
Then when I was 15 we started high school, at that time we were in a relationship for almost three years and people were amazed by the longevity of our couple, because at that age it’s unusual.
But we loved each other so much (and I still love her so much), it was like I had found the perfect person to me and I don't want to speak for her but I felt like I was perfect to her.  We kept growing up, we did our first time together (and all the others, I never had sex with another girl). We wrote long love letters to each other, any pretext was good to say how much we loved each other. I mean, I'm kinda  that cliché of the chunk rugby player, people don't really imagine me doing that, yet for her I‘d have done anything and everything, she was so exceptional, I felt incredibly privileged to be part of her life.
We graduated high school and that summer we moved into our apartment, then started university. I was so glad to live with her, to sleep with her every night. Of course our parents let us sleep together on weekends and holidays but it wasn’t the same, it was a new step in our relationship and we were so happy.
When I explained to my new mates from the university that I had been with my girlfriend for 6 years they were stunned, they asked me if I had never wanted to flirt with another girl or anything and the answer has always been no : since my childhood, I grew up alongside this exceptional girl and I always dreamed of being with her and I felt so lucky to be in a relationship with, I never even noticed any other girl. I found her perfect in every way.
We were so happy. I just want to tell you a little bit about the great person she was. She was so heart warmed, she couldn’t stand injustice. She always wanted to help others. She was so kind and caring. Whenever our friends needed advice or support for something she was the one they call, she was full of wisdom and good intentions. She was always smiling, she illuminated people's lives with her presence.  She was a very funny person as well.  She always saw the bright side of everything, she was so positive. She never gave up, she worked hard to reach her goals. She was so clever, I’d even say brilliant, she was a very gifted student. She was passionate : when she did something she put her whole heart into it.  She made people feeling special, she knew how to bring out the best in them. She always complimented everyone, she was adorable. She was also sensitive, she hated seeing the ugly things of the world, she could cry for that.  But she was also someone who made the world more beautiful by her mere presence.  I’ve never met someone so selfless and altruistic. She was also incredibly beautiful, the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. She was an angel, for her friends, for her family, for me, for my family who loved her too. My mam has three sons and she was used to say that Honey was like her daughter.  My little brother was kinda an hooligan when he was younger and listened neither to my parents nor to me.  She spent so much time helping him, because of her he really took control of his life again.
Everyone loved her, literally.  She was wonderful. She was someone who loved to pamper people.  She could spend weeks making a gift or a surprise for someone, but she was always embarrassed when someone gived a gift to her. I think she was one of the few people who was sincere when they said they preferred to give than to receive.
I felt so good with her, she was the love of my life, literally. I always wondered how she could love me so much, I mean I‘m not that bad and I always did my best especially for her but she was so much better than me. And yet she still looked at me like I was one of the wonder of the world.
We were so happy. I was only 19 years old and yet I saw my life with her and she saw her life with me, we had lots of plans. And even beyond me, she was a great person, who was so young and had her life ahead of her. I mean, if we had broken up, it’d have been incredibly hard but at least she would have kept existing, living, shining as she deserved.  But I cannot bear what happened.
We were together, so happy and in love, I never could have believed that she will  disappear so quickly and in such a brutal way.  No one deserves that and when it happens to someone so close to you, someone you love so much, it’s extremely harsh.
It was a Sunday and we were at our parents’ for the weekend. Sometimes on weekends we slept together and sometimes we slept on our own and we just spent the day together.
On Saturday evening we slept each on our own, her at her parents’ and me at mine, there wasn’t even a particular reason. On Sunday morning she wanted to run for an hour and offered me but I was lazy. I was tired, I wanted to stay in bed an hour more.  It’s absurd : I was studying sports science and I was too lazy to go running. I‘d never forgive myself.
It’s an ongoing case so I’m not allowed to speak in detail about it and anyway it doesn’t have to be, but she was violently assaulted and tortured and died, and then her body was burned. Suspects were arrested a few weeks later, it was in Feb 2019 and the trial was supposed to be in May 2020 but it was postponed because of the coronavirus (France is in quarantine).
I cannot even describe the infinite pain I felt when a few days after his disappearance, while very important research was being carried out, her body was finally found and we knew what had happened to her, I had a blackout.
Since I woke up from this fading away I have been taking heavy psychotropes, that doesn’t prevent me from constantly having anxiety attacks and having to take a fuck ton of sleeping pills to sleep, otherwise I have awful nightmares. I never thought I‘ll fall so low one day, I have always been someone very happy and full-blown.  But I never thought that the love of my life was going to be murdered one day either.
I haven't been going to university since, I don't do anything except think about her all day, I saw a lot of therapist but they only say shit, how am I supposed to accept the sudden death of the  person I love the most in the world and with whom I grew up believing that we were going to spend our lives together ? They tell me about the emotions of mourning but the only emotions I have are deep feelings of hopelessness and hatred towards those who did this.
I feel even worse since I know who did this and what their ""reasons"" were, because they were people I knew. I feel devastated. Sometimes I want to kill myself and sometimes I want to avenge her by killing them. But I feel unable to inflict this pain on my parents, who are very friends with Honey's parents (They had been friends for a long time before, because we are neighbors) and who help them a lot to hold on since it happened, I can see that they have the fear is that I kill myself and to be in the same state as the parents of Honey.
Her parents are suffering so much, they lost their only daughter and I don't know what to do to relieve their pain. Whenever I speak with them they seem so happy all of a sudden, they say that Honey kept living through me. But imo it's not true, she no longer lives and will never lives again and I miss her so, so much. But I know if they say that it’s because they miss her so much too. She is missed by everyone who knew her, she was so wonderful. And I will always miss her.
People tell me that one day when I’ll be happy again and I‘ll meet someone else and go back to normal life. But I know it’s wrong, first I‘ll never be happy again, how am I supposed to live without her after growing up with her ? She was as essential to me as breathing, it’s unbearable to survive since she‘s no longer there, how can I resume a normal life ? And how can I meet someone else ? I never wanted when I was happy and she was there to meet someone else so it isn’t now that I‘m desperate without her that I‘ll want to meet someone, plus she is irreplaceable. I feel devastated. She is the only one I want and yet I know she‘ll never come back. I constantly think of her, of her laughter, her smile, her scent. I bought her perfume and I spray it on my pillow every day, I know it's stupid but it's the only thing that helps me sleep a little better. I just wanna hug her again. Sometimes when people lose a loved one they say they regret not telling them how much they mean to them and at least I’m « relieved » that Honey knew how much I loved her and how important she was to me when she passed away, because I told her every day.
Just before the quarantine there was a commemoration for the one year of her death and everyone looked at me with pity. As I no longer go to class, in rugby or to see my friends I don’t see anyone and I had not seen some people for several months, they were dazed by my appearance. And I hadn't realized but actually I became the shadow of myself, I always was very « strong » and now I‘m extremely bony. It depressed me even more to see how many people seemed concerned when they saw me. That's why I avoid my friends, they don't know what to say (and I understand that's normal, in their place I wouldn't know what to say either) and they‘re also embarrassed not to know what to tell me.
The only person I used to open up to is Honey, and now having to deal with such difficult emotions without knowing to who open up is very painful. My family is trying to support me as much as they can but it's very hard, there was a very bad atmosphere at home, so much so that my parents broke up and my father went back to Ireland with my older brother. I feel like my mom and little brother don't know what to do with me anymore. But I don't know what to do with me either. I think that after the trial I‘ll go to Ireland for a while as well, just to take a break, here every time I go out everyone is aware of what happened, throughout the region (and even outside, but here they recognize me so they look at me with that pitying air that depresses me even more).
I’m not afraid of the judgement, I know they‘ll have a long sentence but I‘m very afraid of the trial in itself and to, during a week or two to, hear what she has been through in detail all day, to see her murderers and to hear what they‘re going to say, I‘m anxious I cannot bear it.  For the moment I’m trying not to think about it. I spend all my time in the tree hut that his father built between our gardens when we were younger. We spent all our time there, when we were teenagers and our parents didn’t want us to sleep together we secretly met there and stayed all night. Everything remained as it’s, when I’m there I feel calmer.
I feel like nothing can ever ease my pain, I don't even know why I came to tell my story here. I just needed to open up and I can't do it with my loved one.

I think my wife saved my life this morning.,"I have severe anxiety. Taking meds, but they’ve kind of stopped working like they used to. Got into a conversation with my wife yesterday and I mentioned “if I were to be in a place where I could just sit still and not have my brain worry about something, I don’t know what I would do with myself.” Anyway, I don’t get into depressive moods too often anymore,  it this morning, 3 days before our 5th anniversary vacation (we never take vacations. Never have the money.) I check my bank account and realize that all of the bills I had planned to come out last week all hit at once and put our account into the negative. By quite a bit. I panicked. My wife had been looking forward to a small trip to Chattanooga to just relax for MONTHS. The kid was to stay at my parents house and we were just going to relax for a few days. When I realized I
messed up the timing on our bills, I spiraled. I absolutely lost control and cried. Lost it. It was probably the worst I have ever felt. I was crying for about 10 minutes when I suddenly had this sense of calm wash over me. Suicide. Easy. I got out of bed, suddenly stoped crying, cleaned my face up and began getting dressed. I told my wife I was going out for a little while. She knew something was going on and refused to let me leave the house. She physically grabbed me, made me look her in the eyes and told me everything was fine. It brought me out of my head. I don’t know if it’s something that I would have gone through with, but in that moment it was the most ok I had ever been with the idea of suicide. We still don’t have the money for the trip, but that’s ok. I know I have someone looking out for me.

I’m killing myself [update],"So most of you probably didn’t even see my post before, which is fine, obviously, but I just felt the need to put this update out for the ones who did. 3 days ago I was so close to taking my own life. I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night. I obviously didn’t respond, but knowing that a random stranger online cares enough about another stranger to make sure they’re okay, well that is special to me. Thank you once again, and I hope every one in this sub finds some sort of happiness in their life. We all deserve it. This is a disease just like diabetes, and you should not be ashamed of it.

"Having wonderful, loving, supportive family doesn’t make you any less depressed.","I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. 

I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. 

There isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. 

I’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. 

Love doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.

I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. 

Even the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. 

My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.

All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. 

My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.

"Depression is the hot funny meme until you're not sleeping, not eating, and hoping you'll die in a car accident","I never understood why so many people see depression as something we can all joke about so fucking carelessly and casually. Like, it's funny and relatable to see tweets and memes about how much depression sucks but it really does so much harm than good, doesn't it? I can't understand how this is just so commonplace. 

I laugh at them. Theyre funny. I see myself in them. And then for hours and days upon days I lock myself in my car with a vague numbness, ditching class or calling off work to just... what, stare off into a void and roll around uncomfortably in my drivers seat in a shitty parking lot, chew through a pack of cigarettes, and just try to settle down suicidal compulsions. I stare in the rearview mirror and gastation bathrooms for forty minutes trying to make sense of who's looking back and why the sight of that person makes my stomach churn. 

I don't sleep for days on end until I collapse. I lose weight in 7 pound intervals. The thoughts of being a fuck-up and how bad I would beat the shit out of myself if I met myself on the street just stew any time Im beside myself. It's so funny! So quirky and relatable! If this is relatable that's fucking tragic. Being a ball of despondency and wanting to break my bones with a baseball bat is something I want everyone to laugh at with me. 

It's three am here and I'm just having a cigarette in an empty bathroom tub because I don't wanna think about anything. I wish there was a way to turn brains off. Medications haven't worked and I don't like being medicated at all anyway. It feels like hitting a plaster wall anytime I try to feel anything.

I used to be a really smart kid. Performed very well on the SAT despite having awful grades due to feeling indifferent about school.

The fact that I'm supposed to keep living and I'm not allowed to kill myself annoys me honestly.,"If I don't wanna keep going why should I?

Perhaps what's worse than depression is not being able to realize if you're having the best time of your life or the worst because it all feels the same.,"I'm having a really hard time keeping up with life, especially since the lockdown started. I just don't feel like I have anything to live for. I *do not* want to be happy. I just don't understand what happiness is to be completely honest. That is not to say that I'm unhappy and miserable, what I'm saying is that happiness and sadness has become the same thing for me. I just can't separate the two. On top of that, there's this feeling of guilt I keep having about everything. I *am* from a rich family, people have always expected me to be on top of everything ever since I learned to walk, but I was never able to be on top. I've always sucked at everything. I tried to be on top, but never made it. And so now I'm this 21 year old uni student. And I've been hammered so much with that mindset of trying to get to be best at everything, and since I've always failed at that, I feel safer as a failure. I just *do not* feel that I want to succeed. I've become an emotional masochist. Sometimes I imagine that a loved one would come and choke me to death to put me out of this misery and leave me in a cold dead end where no one would ever come across again. That's not to say I'm suicidal. I am *not*. I just like having those kinds of imaginations. The only thing I do to keep my mind off of these feelings these days is that I listen to music. Even my genres are New Age, or shoegazing or doom metal, which used to be uplifting epic music. Now I'm not going too much into that stuff, but I hope I've made my point clear. I'm not looking for concrete advice. Perhaps simply writing these down and sharing might help me a lot. Thank you for taking the time to read through this whole post.

She recommended therapy. I said I was going to therapy for a while, but it was expensive and didn’t seem to help at all so I stopped going.

“Um, you can afford alcohol but you can’t afford therapy?” She audibly scoffed into the phone and put me on hold indefinitely. Eventually I hung up.

And yet I'm still always tired. I still don't enjoy anything. I still feel like the useless little shit I was before. It's just wake up, do my routine, go to sleep, repeat.

I suppose I could reach the other end of life without taking shortcuts like this. But fuck me, is it the best I can ever hope for? To just to sort of keep going?  Why should I put in so much work for so little payoff???

I feel like mental illness is the only medical condition where people wished they had cancer instead,"If I had cancer, I could say I needed time off work and everyone would be understanding. I could apply for and receive disability. 

I could freely tell my patients I was gone for 3 months or whatever bc I was doing chemo. 

No one would suggest that I dont need medicine bc Jesus died for my sins. 

I could be slow at work and my coworkers wouldn't think I'm lazy. They'd understand the physical toll cancer inflicts. 

People would rally around me. I could post about my journey on Facebook without shame. 

When I fall apart over small things people like to one up mentor tell me I dont have it bad at all. My health problems would be validated. 

Most importantly I wouldn't feel this terrible soul crushing desire to die.

"Cheers to everyone on here, this sub is the only place I feel accepted. We may be depressed, but we are never dicks to one another or reject each other's voices.","Whenever someone posts something wholesome, everyone cheers for them. Nobody is envious or salty of seeing others get better.  
&nbsp;

Whenever someone posts something depressing, everyone comforts them. Nobody one-ups one another. This sub's etiquette is the epitome of ""Always be nice to people, but if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all.""  
&nbsp;

On other subs like AskReddit, whenever I post a question, it'll always get downvoted right away. I seriously don't care about karma, I just wish my questions become visible because I'm genuinely curious. My questions are usually something like, ""People who manage to get their life together, how did you do it?"".  
&nbsp;

I ask those questions because I'm looking for hope. I try not to make them sound negative but they'll always get downvoted. That makes me feel like I'm not allowed to hear something wholesome. It's like I'm being denied hope.  
&nbsp;

On this sub, it is normal for a post to have 2K upvotes, and stays 99% upvoted, if not 100%. Posts that don't take of, and only have 1 default upvote will usually stay 100% upvoted. So that means the people here very rarely downvote anything. If they're not upvoting it, they just leave it be. We use the upvote and downvote for what they're meant to.

r/depression is not a community in the same sense that r/<put hobby here> is a community (we're not striving to be good at being depressed, we just want it to stop), but this sub is a comforting place despite its depressive nature.

Just because someone has it worse doesn’t make your pain unjustified.,"I hate when people say something along the lines of, “This guy got through this, so you’ll be fine.” When someone is going through tough times in their lives, that is the last thing they’d want to hear. It makes me feel like shit and I’m sure it’s the same for them. It’s toxic and it won’t make someone who’s depressed feel any better if not worse. Think of it as, “Being stabbed by a knife hurts as much as being stabbed by a sword.” Just because the blades smaller doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt. The only reason I’m posting it here is because I hear this toxic shit everywhere. I get it if they are trying to comfort you and they don’t know what to say, but I would think they’d understand it wouldn’t make it any better just because some other guy had it worse.

While yes it can bring someone who’s whining about something trivial to perspective, there’s a line that’s crossed when you tell something like that to someone who’s actually going through depression/tough times.

It only makes me feel worse when I hear this, so if you are going through depression/tough times how would you respond to this? I honestly don’t know how and it makes me feel like shit and that me having gone through depression was something meaningless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/nk0xpn/just_because_someone_has_it_worse_doesnt_make/,depression

Beirut Explosion ended me,"First off I'm a lebanese 24 years old and You can't imagine the life I'm living here. Our house got destroyed in the beirut explosion and my dad got injured.

Depression, Fear and anxiety everyday. Our country is run by corrupted politicians who ruled for 30 years. No one is able to let them go (they have weapons) ... 

I've been unemployed for more than 1 year. 
My father is unemployed too. 

We did a revolution that survived for 5 months but since corona happened it turned off and not one politician was convicted. 

To make it easy to understand our situation , There is no dollars in our country anymore only lebanese money. All our savings in the banks is gone. We became poor. 70% unemployement , everything is expensive ... Imagine Vanezuella but ten times worse ..

I (attempted) suicide by crashing my car into a highway median at 200 km/h and walked out with a minor concussion. I feel like it's a sign I need to step up my action against depression. What are some things I can do to alleviate my depression?,"The title and this story may sound fake (New account to hopefully protect my identity), but I swear to you it could not be more real for me. I wanted to share this, I am not doing this for attention but merely to seek help. More questions will be asked at the end of my story.  As the title describes, a miracle has occurred given the severity and intent of the crash. The paramedics, police, doctors, nurses and my parents all gave me the most puzzled look of their lives when they asked how fast I was going, and I replied ""200 km/h"".

I have been depressed for 4 years now. Nothing has been working and my mental health has declined terribly. I have been on multiple medications, tried behavioural therapy such as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), and even went a course of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). First my motivation to do anything went down; I couldn't eat, do school work and most importantly, socialize. My social circle grew smaller as my depression grew bigger, after 4 years of suffering as well as other health conditions such as horrible eyesight (+10.00 in each eye with astigmatism), sleep apnea and anxiety, I figured life wasn't going to get any better and I decided to end my life.

I drove to the mountains where I decided I would find a large hill, go full speed down it and either turn into the median or drive off the road, ultimately killing myself. About 3 hours from my hometown I found the perfect hill, The road was steep, perfect for gaining speed to ensure a fatal crash. Without thinking too much (I would just talk myself out and not commit), I pulled a U-turn and drove to the hill which was about 5 minutes after that point. They say your life flashes before your eyes, mine played back to me for those 5 minutes. The most important people and influential moments of my life appeared before my eyes. They suddenly disappeared as I approached my chosen hill. My foot automatically floored the gas pedal, I placed my left foot behind the brake so I wouldn't back out. I raced down the hill, gaining more and more speed, by the time I reached the bottom, my car (which only has a speedometer for up to 200 km/h. I saw the road start to bend and I jerked my wheel into the opposite direction of the turn, slamming the front end of the car into the median. That was the last thing I remembered before waking up in my car, with tapping on the window from bystanders. All I could think to myself at that moment was ""wow, I so much of a failure I can't even kill myself"". A bystander described to the paramedics and police that I hit the median, did about 10 spins (no flips) and then continued to scrape median down the hill for another 250m. I got a glimpse of my car before I was taken away in an ambulance, it was completely destroyed. When I arrived to the hospital I was placed in the trauma room however, the doctor was incredibly surprised after seeing me sitting upright with consciousness after a 200 km/h car accident. He assessed me and ordered a full-body CT scan. The results came back clean, no bleeding, no broken bones and most importantly, no death. He then admitted me to the psychiatry ward (which I won't get into on this post but it was a nightmare!!!).

The everyone's surprise I was barely injured, walking away with a concussion with memory loss at most. This phrase really stuck in my mind because nearly every person I have talked to so far has said: ""It's a miracle you're alive"". I'm not religious, but I agree, it is a miracle I'm alive, and I""m not going to waste it. I'm begging for help because I know this community loves to help people when they reach out. I really want to try and beat my depression but I don't know how. I have tried CBT, I'm going BACK to ECT for another round of treatment and I'm on increased medication. I will be seeing counsellors and psychiatrists, however thanks to Canadian healthcare not until 2020 (which is one of the reasons I decided to end it, due to lack of resources).

If anyone out there has any tips on how to manage severe depression and anxiety please let me know. I'm still alive today despite the severity of the crash, and I believe it's a sign that I need to conquer this depression and do something great with my life. I am tired of laying at home, with no energy and no motivation, wasting away my life every day with my depression. I can personally say even those who are suiciding don't want to die, they merely just want to stop existing.

Please help with any advice you have, I'm begging for my life to change, please. I am trying my best to push past my depression and suicidal thinking so I can give life another try.

Here are a list of specific questions that would benefit a lot:

\-How do I keep up my motivation despite having no energy all the time?

\-How can I keep up or have more energy?

\-I'm thinking of going back to school for Nursing, my current position (lab tech) doesn't feel fulfilling and I'm looking for something more. Is nursing school a good idea or will that just make my life more stressful?)

\-What are some habits I could do to alleviate my depression

\-Any secret self-help/feel good tips?

\-How do I make more friends and build a better support network?

\-What do I tell to my friends who have noticed I just ""disappeared"" for a few days?

&#x200B;

Thanks to those who took the time to read this post, I usually get little to no reads on Reddit but I thought I'd share this anyway since not many people can say they survived a 200 km/h automobile suicide attempt and walked out with minor injuries. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

It doesn’t stop. It never fucking does. It’s like I’m haunted by my relatively uneventful past.

It's the easy way out, the only beautiful way out. It's not much, we all die at some point wouldn't hurt to cut myself off from everything as I would lose my consciousness.  

But I am here to live for the mental well being of other people, so they don't be sad. I suffer for them.

Does anyone else feel like being depressed is just part of them? and its something that they will never be able to change about themselves or 'cure'?,"I literally cannot remember a time in my life where I wasn't angry or unhappy with myself or how people treated me. I've had body issues since I was 8 years old because my grandparents overfed me and let me eat sweets all day, which led to me being outcasted by my peers and constantly criticised by my parents. I first started thinking about suicide when I was maybe 12 or 13 and 10 years later I still think about it. I don't think I've ever has a solid year of my life where I've thought that everything was going to be okay and life was worth living. I've had months of temporary relief from the constant pain, but thats all they were; temporary. I thought finding someone to spend my life with and who loves me unconditionally and puts up with my suicidal tantrums would fix me but it hasn't. I thought effectively curing my disfiguring autoimmune disease would help me have a new lease on life, but it hasn't. I have lots of friends, an attractive face, and I had a job I liked. No body in my personal life except for two people know that I struggle, and the rest would never guess it. I have nothing to be sad about, really, I have an objectively easy life. But that doesn't matter, I am depressed and I always will be. I could have the perfect body, my dream job, have millions in my bank account and I'd still feel exhausted.

I'm a 13 year old boy who is abused and need help,"I'm 13 years old and I live with my dad. I'm shared custody from my mom to my dad. My dad is very abusive towards me. I've been diagnosed with depression and PTSD and I've gone to the hospital twice over suicide attempts because every time I'm with my dad I want to kill myself. He pushes me to the limit and I'm afraid that. 

Ever since I was  little, my dad has always beaten me with a belt. Even before I was old enough for school. My dad has beaten me for not doing what I was told to do. He yells curse words at me and uses my mother as an example of what not to be. And that makes me feel sad because I miss my mom. Recently, my grades dropped. I've been having problems at school. I have a hard time focusing and paying attention to what I'm being taught. My dad was pissed. One moment he’s screaming at me and cursing me out and telling me I won't achieve anything in life. And telling me I'm going to regret it when he’s done with me.

My 11 year old brother also made a bad grade, so he walked into my brothers room and I heard screaming and loud sound from my dad hitting him with a belt. Then he walked up to me and told me to give him my hand. I held my hand out and he hit me extremely hard with the belt. I screamed and held my hand, but he told me to hold my hand out again he continue to do it over and over again.

Then he told both of us to come in the kitchen. He started yelling at us saying he was in an ""ass whooping mood"" and that he'd beat us whenever we felt like it. That if we didn't care about our grades he wouldn't care either. That he'd make us feel his pain. He hit me extremely hard. My hand was red and swollen. I had a bruise on my wrist that was slightly swollen and stung to the touch. He told me to hurry and wash the dishes before he'd do it again. And he did. But my hand hurt too badly. He threatened to hold me down.

I'm going to kill myself if I have to continue to live with him. I cannot take this anymore and no one will do anything about it, I decided that when I go back to my mom's on Sunday I am refusing to go back to my dad's. This is what it's come to because he refuses to cooperate and my mom doesn't have enough money to get a lawyer and free legal aid takes too long. So I am not going. I know my dad will call the police if I don't go. When they come, I will talk to them and tell them my situation.

Can they force me to go? What will they do? Because in order to get me to go they would have to physically drag me. I am in fear of my life and I don't want to die but he just pushes me to that limit so I just can't be around him. I don't know how many times I've tried to tell my dad this and even my therapists have tried to tell him this.

He doesn't care, he simply denies treating me the way he does saying he's never called me the things he does on a daily basis like dumbass, idiot, son of a b\*\*\*, and he even calls my brother those things and denies it. Then when we're in public or around other people he acts like a totally sweet person, and his girlfriend thinks that I'm the problem because he constantly complains about me when really it's just a big show.

23 F. I feel so behind Everyone. I feel like a 13 year old.,"I know I shouldnt complain at 23 But Ive struggled with depression since I was 13. Every year. For 10 years. I have few positive memories. Im tired and I dont want to do keep trying anymore. Everything ive tried never has worked. Meditation. CBT. Psychologists. Psychiatrists. Medication. Sleeping Pills. Weed.

I feel so young (because I havent literally done much at all with my depression+anxiety) but ancient at the same time. I have no passions, no interests. No goals. Havent had good friends in years. Virgin. I dont go out. I dont take photos, I dont use social media. I feel like I dont exist. I dont even have a fucking job now. Never had a boyfriend.

Literally the only thing Ive done is graduate university and I cant even get a fucking job.

Ive struggled in everything ive ever done. School. Hobbies. Uni. Work. Job Applications. Appearance.

The only time ive ever been hit on is at clubs. I just hate seeing other people my age succeed and do well in life. Even people who are 17-18, have had more experiences then me. I hardly go out. Ive spent 90% of time at home alone with my elderly parents. 

I try so hard, but Im still a loser and I hate it. Im not introverted and I just hate how my life has become. I hate it..I do. I feel like I must be such damaged goods that its too late to get better. These last 6 years in particular have flown and Im just so fucking done.

Its not like Ive tried. For 2 years Ive tried joining groups, volunteering etc to improve my situation but i get nowhere. No one wants a bar of me.

I'm too fucked up. I just exist. I doubt anyone will care to read this... they never do.,"I don't want advice. I don't want to hear that my problems aren't a big deal while you stand there with your success stories and your dating histories and your loving partners. I don't want to hear your stories about how you found your SOs when this is specifically a major part of what's wrong with me; literally a simple ""this is what helped me"" would be nice, not trying to make me feel worse. I don't want to hear the same bullshit about loving myself. I barely even have the energy to write well. I want to vent about how much I hate myself. How FUCKED UP I am.

I've lost 10 years, maybe more than that to porn addiction. I don't know if I walked in on my parents or if I was exposed to sexuality at a young age. But I've been masturbating since long before I even hit puberty. And then I discovered porn. Which leads me to now. A porn addict trying to break his habits by only masturbating 3 days a week... and then that's only turned into masturbating *multiple* times a day. It's fucked my relationships up. I can make friends, guys call me cool and women call me sweet. But I just... I'm too scared to escalate sexually and romantically. I can't stand up for myself so people walk over me. I'm afraid of taking risks. I'm a virgin at almost 23. I do not have a car, can't even drive. Never held down a job. Trying to lose weight but making no progress. Never been to a bar. Only been to one party. Never hooked up. Never had a relationship. The only things I have going for me are my writing and my drawing, and even then I'm losing interest in those as well. I don't blame women. I don't blame men either. It all lies with me.

My family isn't any better. I've tried talking about this to them multiple times. I can predict exactly what they say: ""this too shall pass"", ""believe what you want to believe"" ""if you believe it won't happen, it won't."" Yeah, great. Thanks for the ""help."" And then there's the verbal abuse from my narcissistic shrew of a mother and the complete apathy of my father, who constantly tells me he'll have my back but never seems to step up when I truly need him... but he IS happy to yell at and threaten me every time I try standing up for myself against my mother. Every time I try to leave, they threaten to call the cops. I have nowhere to go, no source of income.

I am a fucked up, broken, weird piece of trash who drags the few people who care for him down with his negativity. They're better than me, none of them deserve me. I feel this void in the center of my stomach and heart wherever I go, and now that I've spent all day reading through reddit (seriously, every time these moments of depression happen, ***EVERY*** post I see has to be about sex and dating and relationships), I feel even worse. So much worse than yesterday. I can't forgive myself for the thing's I've done in the past. I sabotage myself every single time. In my worst moments I have these thoughts, these fucking FANTASIES of tying a wire to my neck and the other end to a car, and then letting the wire hang me and hopefully cutting my head off.

All I do is exist. I can't live like this. Normally I don't feel suicidal. But now the thoughts are coming back. Wanna know the funny thing? If I die, people will just go ""that sucks, pass the apple juice"", chalk me up to a statistic, and forget. Because nobody gives a shit about worthless men who can't keep up with the rest of them.

I don't even know why I wrote this. Nobody is going to notice or care. People rarely do anyways.

Do you ever feel guilty that your parents got stuck with such an incompetent failure?,"I think about it a lot. My mom has a friend of hers who has 2 kids. One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. 

Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think ""if only she knew how I would turn out."" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. 

Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes.

I'm tired of being everyone's therapist when no one will give me ten serious minutes of their time.,"I've had a bunch of stuff happen to me in the past month. I got appendicitis and surgery; still recovering. Accidentally twisted my ankle. I got a cold, which I'm still fighting. However, none of that seemed to be enough for people to give me a break from emotional labor; they demand it from me 24/7, practically. Not asking for advice, really just ranting. These are just a few examples.

I had my sister calling me talking about her boyfriend who just drinks all the time and does nothing, and she was complaining about how she hates where she works. I tell her to get rid of the man and get a job somewhere else. It wasn't as short as it sounds. I listened to her and gave her serious advice, though I know she won't take it because she never does. Instead of thanking me, no one ever does, she tells me that it's easy for me to tell her to just get another job because I don't have one and can just sit around and sleep. Well, thanks, I just love sitting around and thinking about my crappy life; it is a positive joy. We hadn't spoken until her son ended up in an issue and, of course, the family therapist (me) gets a text, asking me to talk to her son and try to get him to listen to ""reason"". I agree just because I know my nephew doesn't get good support from her. Come to find out, she's mad because he's dating some girl who has a kid already. I can't say it's great at his age, but he's also an adult, so I just told him to be careful, watch out for emotional abuse, and reminded him of his last relationship, which was like a copy of his mom's relationships; she doesn't realize he gets his bad examples from her. After talking to him, his mom texts me and is like, ""I'm getting off work in a few hours, I'll call and we can do a three-way call and talk to him."" Nowhere did she ASK me if this was okay, didn't ask if I was busy or anything, but as with most of my family, since I'm at home, I never have anything important to do, so they just tell me to do stuff instead of asking, like I'm a human being. I tell her I texted him and I was still recovering and needed to sleep. She didn't ask me what I was recovering from, if I was okay, nothing. Just said, ""Okay, night."" 

My niece had trouble at school and she's a lot like my sister, unable to let go of things. She's upset because some girl at school wants to fight her because my niece took her chair. A chair this girl wasn't using, mind you, but that was just sitting next to her. My niece calls me, upset and frantic over this because the girl won't let it go and went to the office and had my niece called out of class because the girl wanted an apology. My niece refused because she said she hadn't even done anything and she went to the principal, who told her that the girl is known for ""keeping things going"", so she wouldn't be bothered again, but my niece wouldn't get off the phone until I promised to stay up until she got out of school in case they call her into the office again and she wanted me to talk to them. A huge reason I don't have kids is so I don't have to deal with the stress of dealing with teachers and other parents, yet I have to be a parent to my niece because my sister won't be. Mind you, I had just come back from the doctor, had been hopped up on pain meds and wanted to do nothing, but sleep. I forced myself to stay awake, but thankfully, no one called.

Then, my sister calls me and is crying, telling me how much she wants her boyfriend to leave the house. So, I don't say anything and just let her talk. Finally, she's like, ""I just don't know what to do or how to get him out of my house."" I told her to call the police; she doesn't want to get him in any more trouble because he has a DUI because he drinks and drives. SHE allows him to drink and drive her car, because he doesn't have one and doesn't have a license. I won't even touch how stupid that is. So, I get frustrated with her and tell her that I keep telling her how to get rid of him and she never listens, so I don't know what she wants me to do. She acts like I offended her and is like, ""I just called to vent, can't I vent, sometimes?"" I tell her that she can, but I'm tired of getting calls almost every week about this man; I'm not her therapist or life coach or anything, I'm barely hanging on by a thread a lot of days and hearing about this situation distresses me because, even if I don't like her very much, I don't want to hear about anyone dealing with this type of stuff. Not to mention, her best friend was killed just a few months ago by her boyfriend who was abusive and drunk a lot... make him leave before he gets to that point. Anyway, she accuses me of making it about me and hangs up. Maybe I did make it about me, but I want people to understand that I am not a therapist and I cannot fix their issues and I'm not emotionally well enough to take on all this stuff. I'm not sure anyone is, tbh.

Finally, we come to today. My mother had to take me to the doctor because I couldn't get there on my own and need support to get there. We're talking about normal stuff, then she's like, ""Aren't you tired of just sitting at home and doing nothing? You really need to get out and get a life."" I don't ever like talking to my mom about my mental health because she acts like it's a phase that should have been over in my teens and she doesn't understand why I'm ""letting it bother me"" as an adult. I'd like to mention, she has horrible anxiety, as well, but she powers through it to work, at least, it still takes over her life. She also doesn't do much outside of the house and has no life, but when I point that out, she brings it back to me. Anyway, I tell her I just paid all the bills and since the bills got higher, I don't have money to have a life, even if I wanted to. So, then, she's like, ""If you get a job, you'd have more money."" I know this, but I have tried many times to hold a job; I cannot do it for more than a few days without having panic attacks and breakdowns, which either end up with me leaving or getting let go, which then leads me into a deep depression. She acts like I don't try and this is even with medicine and therapy. Sometimes, I'm sure the main reason none of this works is because I'm around my family, but I never tell them that because I don't want to deal with that fallout. At this point, I'm just tired of the conversation, so I don't respond. Then, she brings up how I need to get some friends, at least... says the woman who literally has one friend and who got upset at my aunt for going out without her, even though she never goes anywhere when she invites her. Heavy eyeroll. Anyway, I tell her that I've tried to have friends; it's not my fault they don't put effort in and either they end up not talking or I fade out because nothing is happening. She asks me why I don't hang out with the people I met last summer. The two girls I met last summer were nice, but one would rarely go out with us because she would rather stay in with her boyfriend, which left me and the other girl. We hung out a few times, but then she got a new trivia group and stopped texting me back, so I stopped texting her and let that fade out. This happens too often, so I stopped trying to make friends. I tell my mom that I don't talk to them anymore, and she's like, ""That's your problem, you don't try and cut people off so quickly."" I texted the second girl every day for a week; she wasn't working at the time and she was always posting snaps, so I knew she was available, I wasn't going to keep texting for no reason. I try to have boundaries and get crapped on for them. Unfortunately, I am not one of those people who will keep trying and trying and trying when I see things obviously aren't going along, anymore. She then goes into this long story about how she met her only friend and how they only talk like once a month, but they are still good friends and I need to be more ""realistic"" with friends. What good is a friend whom I only talk to for 10 minutes once a month and hang out with, maybe once every three months? If that works for her, great, but that's not ""getting a life"" or anything else. Plus, I have a history of getting friends and then I become the ""therapy friend"" and I fade away because all they ever do is come around to dump their problems on me and get advice, then I don't hear from them for months, when something else is going wrong. That's not friendship, to me. 

And go back to my mom and my aunt. My aunt is mad at my mom for ""checking up on her"" at her age and, of course, I get pulled into it because my mom is being childish and won't talk to my aunt, so I've been designated the go-between, but I never said I would be. They are 20+ years older than me, why am I even in this?

I don't know. I'm just tired of being everyone's therapist and mediator. I keep trying to explain how draining it is. They obviously see I have my own issues, but they continually pour their issues onto me, expect sincere, helpful, empathetic responses, but let me feel bad or need something and everyone is busy or doesn't answer their phones or I get ""advice"" that isn't helpful. My niece and nephew would probably talk, but I don't want to burden them with my issues; their mother does that to them enough, and they complain about it, to me, of course. What is it about me that makes everyone think I'm a therapist? Plus, none of them pay me for my services. That probably makes me more upset than anything; if I was a real therapist, I'd probably be rich off all these ""sessions"", lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/e9uflv/im_tired_of_being_everyones_therapist_when_no_one/,depression

Im so tired. I’m so tired of existing. I’m so tired of being mad. I’m so tired of being tired. It’s pathetic. I’m a 25 year old adult who’s stuck living at home with my family. I can feel myself falling apart and I’m reaching the point where I’m finally just going to take myself out of this shitty game called life, or I’m going to end up cutting ties all together with my family, which is where I’ll probably sink. If it’s sink or swim out in the big world. 


I am holding on to so many grudges. From so many years. That I clearly can’t cope with in a healthy way.

 {My thoughts on my father}

{{{{As an adult now. I realize that I spent probably the first 18 years of my life. Living in literal fear of my pseudo racist father. I still remember being 6 years old or so and hearing my mother scream for my brother because my father was choking her in their bedroom. Was a big steroid fan back in the day. I spent most of my middle school and high school career grounded from one semester to the next one because I frequently got C’s in school which my parents would ground us for. Even one C on the report card and it was grounded for the rest of the semester. I still remember getting in trouble so badly for lying about doing my homework, not even so much for not doing my homework. But it was distinctly about lying about it. My father was beating me in our dining room and at one point was physically choking me against the wall, and I remember my mother saying “well Don’t choke him (insert name)” and him looking straight at her with his hands around my neck saying “I’m not choking him” I still remember that same night him having to come in my room to change my ice packs on my swollen face and how petrified I was that the gameboy sp I was playing was flung off the bed in a room with no carpet because I was certain I was going to get beat again. I remember going to school the next and having to tell my teachers (because all six of them forced me to stay after class and talk about it) that I was playing football with my brother and fell on a sprinkler. Funny how their response to me lying about homework was to in turn go to school and lie about why half of my face was swollen and black. I remember the first time i was ever caught shoplifting (was obviously my last time doing it too) when my dad came to pick me up, he was already so nasty to me before leaving the store that the police threatened to not let me leave because he was already trying to hit me in front of them. 

But you know. Now that I’m an adult and have been jumped literally just because of my sexuality. If I’m going to get my ass beat I’m going to get my ass beat. I’m just not living in fear anymore. }}}}


 {my thoughts on my brother}

{{{{Which brings me to my brother. Who as of lately might as well be dead to me. We have not currently spoken since April, and as far as I’m concerned we probably won’t ever speak again. Let’s start with me saying I feel like my brothers relationship with me has always been from the start. Me bailing him out when he needs it. I remember being in elementary school and him getting to go back to sleep after my mother woke us up for breakfast and would leave for work, because it was my job to “wake him up after rugrats” when he was about 12 or 13 he got mixed up with a bad neighborhood kid and ended up almost lighting an entire house on fire in our neighborhood. The police officers were nice enough to offer him the deal that if you stay out of trouble until you’re 18 this will be completely removed off your record with no trace of it ever even happening. Sure enough he starts smoking weed in high school (which is back when it was HIGHLY frowned upon) and guess who had to take every single drug test for his four years of high school. My dumb ass. Bailing him out again. Until finally he got caught coming back late from lunch (upper class men were at the time allowed to leave campus for lunch) and he came back with a hotboxed car and didn’t air it out. So when the principle stopped him to ask why he was late she was literally hit with a cloud of smoke. My brother was the sole reason my high school was no longer allowed to leave campus for lunch. My brother and father have always had an awful relationship too obviously all this places even more tension on it, and eventually lead to him either being kicked out or leaving. I don’t remember which. Being on the streets on his own he was arrested more times for carrying stupid large amounts of weed on him because he sells it, and eventually got charged I think with robbery. Then to top it all off, a few years ago my brother got mixed up in the flocka epidemic. And of course there’s my dumbass bailing him out again being forced to put two stolen bikes in my car and drive him to Miami. 
When I first started realizing how much I hated him was I think my senior year of high school. My parents had gone out of town leaving him in charge. I remember distinctly it was the night before vans warped tour he’s in a huge fight with his at the time girlfriend, because he was literally hitting either her, or her and/or her kid. And I remember he stormed into my room flinging open the door trying to use me as an excuse “isn’t this okay because it’s what dad used to do to us. “ of course having a criminal record he couldn’t find a job and was on probation at my parents house and because nobody wanted to hire somebody with his record they literally gave him a fucking job at the company my father works for. This job is 15$ an hour, gets benefit and vacation days. I on the other hand spent years being treated like shit in jobs. Two years ago I worked for quiksilver over the course of about a year, finally left because they told me and a coworker that we were the ones being considered for management and yet they brought in two outside hires after the second one the other coworker had the sense to leave. My dumb ass stayed thinking well now that she’s gone it’ll look better on me. Which is when they brought in another outside hire. Who I was eventually cool with. I just stopped offering to do the management work for sales associate pay. Until I finally got so fed up that I transferred to GameStop because they were willing to start me as a keyholder since I already had basic management training. So two years trying to work for a manager only to be shit on by my parents because it’s not full time and “at your age your brother worked full time” at my age y’all gave him a fucking career because nobody wanted to hire a literal criminal. Anything I do It’s just never going to be good enough. 


Let me talk about our most recent altercation, because it’s a fantastic transition into my mother, as of last April I was unfortunately unemployed thanks to this whole virus outbreak, and of course that sets off my family members because I sleep all day while they work. So my mother asked me on April 20th the day before my birthday (a day that I was operating on approximately 2 hours of sleep because I’m always up all night) if I could go help my brother in the warehouse where he works because he really needs it.  I have already had altercations with my brother there from helping him a previous time. It was so bad that they sent me home early. So being there in general makes me uncomfortable. Even when I go in to help my dads department. So of course I didn’t want to help which wasn’t an acceptable answer to my mother and after about the 5th time of her saying something obviously I snapped and agreed to which she responded “forget it” and slammed my door shut. (It should be noted that in my mother’s defense I’m a nightmare to wake up because of how little I sleep. There are times I wake up and am in a fight with my mother because she apparently tried to wake me up and I was nasty, meanwhile I have literally no recollection of even speaking to her ) so my dumb ass trying to bite the bullet agrees to go work for eight hours in a hot sweaty warehouse with barely any ac on my birthday of all days. I woke up that morning still mad about the fight I had with my mother the day prior because I feel like as a grown ass adult I should be allowed to say no I don’t want to do something. 

Get to the warehouse work the shift, I leave at five, which apparently was a mistake because I wasnt supposed to leave until 5:30 which I thought was fine because 1) I genuinely thought they left at 5 every day and 2) I didn’t take a lunch break because I was hoping if we happened to get everything done early we would just be able to leave. Obviously that was wrong and I got a shitty passive aggressive text message from my brother.

Having already been in a bad mood from my fight with my mother the day before partnered with my brother annoying me after I had left I stopped by aunts house to vent because I was literally seeing red. Wasn’t even planning on going home for my birthday because I just didn’t want to be around any of them. 


The next day comes and I don’t show up because not only did I not want to be there, but when I had gotten there the day before another employee of that company said “we don’t know if we’ll need you tomorrow or not yet” so I just didn’t bother to show up because if y’all needed me you should have worked that into your text message when you were being an asshole in my opinion. So of course my petty ass isn’t going to show up.  My brother comes home through the door doesn’t even put his shit down and is in my face screaming at me for not showing up “why should I have to explain to my boss why you didn’t come” “why do you get to sleep all day while we work I’m sick of it” turning to my mother “I’m sick of him aren’t y’all sick of him” (to which she agrees probably just trying to get him to calm down, but I won’t ever for a second forget you just said you were sick of me. ) and of course I’m running my mouth back in return, which is when he decided to put his hands on me, shoving me literally to the floor. And this is about where I Black out with anger because I had my Nintendo switch in my hand. The limited edition no longer in production animal crossing themed one at that. So obviously I’m pissed and yank his PlayStation out of the wall and slam it on the ground. You can skip the next parentheses part if you don’t care about why a stupid video game console made me so upset.

(A detour to mention about these video game consoles. My brother and I used to exclusively use Xbox but I made the transition to the PS4 when it came out. My brother didn’t. I had been asking for a PlayStation 4 since they came out for both my birthday and Christmas for I think like two years. Until the year my brother spent Christmas in jail because he was addicted to flocka. When my mom finally bailed him out because she felt like he was actually clean, he got a PlayStation 4. When I asked why he got one and I didn’t despite it literally being the only thing I asked for as a Christmas gift, she said “well he wasn’t here for Christmas so I had to make it special.” I think I eventually got the PlayStation for my birthday the following year. But this fucking switch man. I swore up and down when I was a GameStop employee that they were going to make an animal crossing version and they all laughed at me said if it was going to happen it would have already and talked me into buying just a standard switch instead. Low and behold a few weeks later the animal crossing one is announced and I’m lowkey heartbroken that I just spent a majority of my money on the standard one. I eventually get myself so worked up over it that I asked my mom to front me the money to buy the new system, and I will give her 200 when I sell my switch and the rest from my next paycheck. She’s talking some I can’t I don’t have that kind of money, which would have been totally fine. I was just embarrassed that I not only put my pride away to ask for money, but was also upset enough about not getting the animal crossing one to even be in this situation. So whatever whatever we end up agreeing on if I sell the console first and give her the two hundred she will give me the rest. Where as I was only asking her for the front because I didn’t want to risk selling my console before the new one came out and risk then not having a console at all. Especially since I had already missed like two years of the switches lifespan.  So obviously I’m super thankful to my mom and I literally spent like two days thanking her and talking to her about it, only for me to find out that she had given me my own money. I don’t know what it was for, possibly my unemployment since the console came out around the time the virus was starting to flare. And at that point all I can keep thinking is wow. You really kept my own money from me, made me gamble on being able to find a limited edition console without a preorder. And told me you couldn’t loan me anything. That makes me so mad. How are you going to lie about my own damn money. Serves me right I guess for not being adult enough to stop using our joint bank account.) 

Anyway. I slam his PlayStation on the ground after he put his hand on me the first time we get into a screaming match in his room to which I say something along the lines of “you’re allowed to knock my switch out of my hand so why should you expect any different of your PlayStation” to which he responds (talking out of his ass) “well you didn’t pay for it mom did!” Jokes on you asshole not only did I pay for it entirely with my money but our mother literally withheld my own money from me and made it more difficult for me to get an already difficult to get console. This ends up with him coming back into my room because everyone in my family (myself included) has to have the last word in argument. Which leads to him putting his hands on me a second time except this time since there’s not a 400$ gaming system in my hand I pull his disgusting ass down with me.}}}}}

This whole fight somehow ends with me being kicked out of my house by my mother. 

 {my thoughts on my mother}

{{{{Fun fact. Maybe about a week before this my mother was begging me to stop going out despite taking precautions with a mask and specially made sanitizer consisting of primarily alcohol. Because they had a friend in critical condition from covid. This is the same woman who threw her kid out into streets during the first peak of this epidemic. (I’m in Florida so it is at this moment higher than that first peak because Floridians are trash) so I spend the next three or four day sleeping in my car doing whatever trying to manage on my own, spending what little money I had fixing the joycon drift on my switch that was non existent until my brother attacked me with it in my hand. One thing leads to another and I eventually end up back home. I asked my mom if we could start family therapy because I’m literally holding onto grudges that I don’t know how to let go of. She says when all of this is over but I’m positive she’s forgotten about it and it might very well be what causes me to cut her out all together. 

A few days ago me and my mother got into a huge arguement because she woke me up to ask me to take her to firestone to pick up her car(I’m exhausted but totally not a problem to me at all) so I get right up get dressed grab my keys and when I walk out of my room she goes “are you ready now I’m not in a rush or anything” I was a little annoyed by the stupid question I’ll admit, like you just two minutes ago came into my room to wake me up and ask me to take you. Yes I’m ready to go lol. Otherwise I’d still be asleep. She of course takes my flat response (a slight mixture of both my annoyance and exhaustion) as me being in a bad mood. So we get into my car and she’s overreacting because my car is a little shaky (which I’m almost positive is just because I need air in my tires) talking some oh my god we have to pull over what if you have a flat. Like we definitely would know if we were driving on a flat tire. It’s been doing this since like the second week I got this car. So I’m just sitting there trying to get to the destination as fast as possible trying to hold my tongue and not cause a fight when she sets me off and says something along the lines of “you’re in a bad mood because I asked you to take me” my response being “oh what I’m in a bad mood because I got right up to do something you asked me to do???” which fucking infuriated me and caused a screaming match in my car. I don’t understand why she has this god complex where she thinks she gets to tell other people how they feel about something. She did it to me on my birthday too which I forgot to mention and am now too lazy to go back and add in. But like it drives me crazy. I don’t care if they’re right wrong or somewhere in between. Nobody has the right to decide how somebody feels about something except for that person. So when I sit there and tell you I’m not mad and you tell me “yes you are mad that’s why you’re being shitty” that’s a self fulfilling prophecy right there. Of course that shits going to make me mad. If you’re just going to decide I’m in a bad mood for me then shit I guess I’m in a bad fucking mood then. 

So this screaming match in my car leads to her saying “I hope something happens to your car, and when it does DONT call me”. I will never ever in a million years forget she said that to me. I hope that when something does happen to my car, I’m inside of it, I hope it’s something fatal, and I hope she has to live with it for the rest of her life. And then of course after our screaming match she sends me a passive aggressive text message (because apparently my family is famous for doing that shit) talking some I won’t be screamed at in a car that I bought you, you are SO disrespectful the next time you talk to me like that you can find a new place to live! (As if she didn’t kick me out when I was 16, and 18, and 23. Like clearly I can manage in my car bitch try me. I would rather starve to death on the streets than feel like I need help from someone who treats me like shit) Skip the parentheses if you don’t care about context with my car history

(Both me and my brother were fortunate enough to get cars for our 16th birthday. The difference between us is my brother has wrecked I think 2 cars my parents bought him, one car they gave him because my mom got a new car (which that one he wasn’t at fault for but still it’s a car to add to your tally) and ruined one of my dads trucks that he was using for whatever reason one day.  I on the other hand drove the same car that I had since I was 16 until literally this year when I turned 25 and was given a new one. But honestly my parents had been trying to buy me another one for a few years I just fought them on it because I didn’t want a new car which I will explain why later. )

And then now just today, we are in another arguement because I think last night, my brother walked out our back gate to go sell drugs in our mailbox because he thinks he’s cool and tough and can handle jail as if he isn’t literally crying “mommy bail me out” when he’s in there. As he’s going out he knocks over the ashtray I had been using over there (which was admittedly in the walkway but only because that particular night I was in a hurry to relocate under my backyard awning because it was raining and I had all my technology on me) but when he walks back he has the nerve to say to me “your ashtray is knocked over “ as if i wasn’t outside and heard him kick it over like I’m supposed to lean up after him. Despite us having literally not a said a word to eachother since April. So I hid the ashtray that he normally uses with the mindset of “if he needs an ashtray he’ll have to go over and clean up the one he kicked over.” Only for me to find that my mother ended up being the one to clean up his mess. Which of course infuriated me. And then she had the nerve to defend him in a text message after we got into an arguement about it. “Well it is your ashtray...” okay did I kick over my ashtray or did my brother. Because that’s the person who should have cleaned it up was who knocked it over. 

In regards to my mother specifically it hurts me the most. Because I often at times feels like she’s the only one out of the 3 of my immediately family that I could have a relationship with or that I actively want to have a relationship with and that bridge is so close to being burnt to a crips. I don’t want to appear ungrateful because as a mother she does go above and beyond. I’ve been spoiled sure. But my problem with it is, I feel like my mother only gives as much as she gives so that she has ammunition to hold over peoples head. I fought her for YEARS about getting a new because I knew she would just hold it over my head. Which obviously I was right about. I remember being kicked out when I was 18 because I wasn’t working and i had just gotten kicked out of college and she said leave your keys pack your stuff and find somewhere to live. So I did set off with no car no money no nothing ended up being taken in by my best friends family. Spent a year or two there, and I literally did not get my car back (the same one she had given me at 16) until the girl I was living with literally called her in tears asking if we could just borrow it so we could go see her mother who was in the hospital because she needed brain surgery. LITERAL BRAIN SURGERY was the only reason I got my car back. And it still took my friend like two or three times of asking my mother for her to let me use my car just to take her to see her mother. 

My father has always babied me and let me get away with more than he lets my brother get away with I can admit that. The problem with it is, that because I don’t feel the same type of yearning for a relationship about my father that I do about my mother I don’t really care about him favoring me. And because my dad tends to let me get away with more my mom feels like she has to let my brother get away with more, which in turn causes me to always just feel like I’m chasing my mother’s approval or some shit. }}}}



 {thoughts on my own disgusting self}

It’s only been recently that I’m starting to come around to my father and that’s only because I think I’m starting to hate my mother. 


I know I probably sound ungrateful and entitled. And I can see why. But I am truly thankful for how privilege I’ve been and all that I’ve been given. But I don’t know how to not feel the way that I feel about these things. 


And that’s not to say I’m perfect either. I’ve caused plenty of problem for my family. So let me just skip to all my flaws now. 

When I was a kid like before I could even start kindergarten I was literally already sucking dick. My next door neighbor ( my brothers age at the time) used to make me do it to him and I used to agree because he was considerably nicer to me when I do would so. He was already a problem child too but that’s neither here nor there. I was pretty much only sucking him off because my brother always hated when I would hang out with him and his friends, and the neighbor always let me hang around (for obvious reasons) distinctly remember my brother catching us a few times but I guess nothing was ever done about it. Not even sure if my parents know about it. 

But as an adult I can see that’s where I started getting fucked up. Idk if I necessarily blame my neighbor for me being gay, because I do firmly as a gay man believe that it’s just who you are and can’t be changed, but I feel like there will literally always be a part of me that questions it. Like what if I wasn’t sucking dick at five years old, would I be interested in girls? I remember having a crush on at least two different girls before i met (what I now as an adult realize was probably my first boy crush) like looking back on my child hood I vividly remember playing “doctor” with other kids or truth or dare that always ended sexual and I realize like damn. That’s fucking gross we were all kids. 


Fast forward to me being in I think middle school, and I was caught sexually experimenting with my cousin. I was definitely old enough to know better so I take fault there, but I also wasn’t ever the one initiating it. You know. I was letting him suck me off for longer than I can remember honestly, but I also distinctly remember I wasn’t the one initiating it. I still remember the first night at his house when he asked me to go pornhub and grilling him about how he even knows about that. I don’t remember when I started letting him do stuff to me, but I know that I shouldn’t have. I remember well enough that when he would come sleepover there were times I would opt to stay up late with my father in hopes that he would fall asleep waiting for me to come in. I remember one time I was up late and he comes walking out like 2 hours after being put to bed because he was trying to get me to come in to bed with him. But again I was the older kid in that situation. So that’s my fuck up. Obviously when we got caught it put a wedge between that side of our family. I can see why, but in hindsight I always wonder. Would you have still distanced yourself if you knew it was your son who had been initiating it? Because he was younger all the blame was pushed onto me. And I can see why. Again I should have known better. 

That’s probably around the time I started getting fat. By high school at one point I was over 300 pounds and openly gay. Never had a serious relationship. Never even had someone interested in a relationship with me. I can see why. Not only was I cringey in high school but I was literally disgusting. It wasn’t till about my senior year I finally got back under 300 pounds and started losing some weight and gaining some confidence. 

But here’s the kicker. Before I started losing the weight I had become a literal serial catfisher. And I’m talking like anybody you wanted to see naked I would go out of my way to target. Friends, friends boyfriends. Nobody was off limits to me. It makes me sick thinking about the hundreds of people I’ve catfished because I was horny and lonely. Catfishing even basically got me kicked out of my college ( granted I was surprisingly innocent at that time but because the kid found out about me being a catfish he refused to believe it wasn’t me, despite me literally having to show my catfish accounts to the dean and them not matching up to whoever he was talking to. The college only realized their mistake a semester or two later because the kid was immediately put on academic probation the semester following my suspension, and then got caught trying to do the same thing to another gay student the semester after that. Which is when they were like wow we were wrong we’re so sorry don’t even worry about the requirements we gave you for coming back you can just come back never did though.) 

It wasn’t only until I hit maybe 22 or 23 that it like clicked with how awful what I was doing was. And started making an active effort to stop it. And I feel like I was only even willing to because I fell in genuine love with somebody I was catfishing. When I finally told him, we were fine for a few days. He told me he didn’t care that I was a guy because he fell in love with the person behind a screen. But all of that quickly crumbled to ashes. That’s another one that’s my own fault. Not only was I doing something shitty but I was also in too deep. I think I still to this day get texted from somebody I started catfishing when I was about 15 or 16 that I just am too afraid to finally tell the truth to. 

But since the recent heart break I’ve thankfully been able to almost entirely remove catfishing from life save for the one guy I was in too deep with, and the old catfish accounts that I occasionally log into when I’m desperately alone/horny/whatever it may be. 

I’m tired of feeling alone. I just want to be loved. I want someone to want me. To care about me.

I’m starting to realize this world is awful. Almost every thing and everyone in it is bleak. Some people genuinely want to live long happy lives, me personally, I don’t think I can make it doing this shit for another 25 years. Self deprecating jokes and suicidal humor are my biggest weapons. Because I feel like if I don’t turn them into jokes. I’ll let them overcome me. Too many people in this world are awful. I don’t want to be one anymore. 


I doubt any of you will actually care enough to read this through. But if you for some unknown reason did, then I thank you. Because I could really use a friend. 



TLDR; I’m a scumbag. I’m starting to think my family is scumbags, and I’m genuinely losing my will to live. I’ve been holding on to grudges that are literally consuming me and transforming me into a being of hatred and it makes me sick to my stomach. I don’t know how much longer I can do this, but god I would absolutely love to just be taken out by a bus tomorrow.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/hzah5n/im_begging_somebody_to_read_this_i_desperately/,depression
My sister saved my life yesterday.,"There I was minutes away from grabbing my gun, about to walk in the woods and end it. Was actually starting to feel pretty good about that too. Not having to hate myself, going through life everyday while nothing seems to make me happy anymore. Then my younger sister gave me a rock she painted for me. Blue with a guitar on it, and a moon with stars in the middle of the guitar. It said made in 2020, Love Nikole. I almost cried in front of her which is something she's never seen me do. It just hit me so hard, like beyond words. My family is very loving but they mostly keep to themselves. I just thought to myself, how could I put her and everyone else through such a thing. Spent half the night crying like a little girl, I'm 34M. Still woke up feeling like garbage, but I dunno somethings different, I guess that feeling like someone's thinking of me is helping a bit. I can't say anything to her now but in the future I'm really gonna thank her for that. I still feel like I don't wanna be here, but whereas before it was 100%, now I'm slightly on the fence about it. Hopefully this is a little inspiration for those out there thinking like me. I should probably reach out to her but things like that are so hard for me, plus then the whole family would know.

Depression turns me into a bitter self-destructive asshole w no empathy,"It’s such a toxic downward spiral. My depression manifests itself as chronic indifference, loss of interest in doing anything, no hope/purpose in life, and the general malaise causes me to, perhaps worst of all, turn into a bitter, insufferable asshole. Everything and everyone bothers me to a much stronger degree. I become increasingly judgemental and dismissive of others. I lash out and hurt those close to me when I need them most. It’s like I’m a completely different person; everything sucks, everyone sucks, and I don’t want to deal with any of it. 

It’s incredibly destructive but I honestly can’t help myself, as I’m too depressed to even maintain a conversation and feign interest or empathy in anyone to begin with. I used to be so charismatic, but trying to rekindle that energy again just makes me come off as janky and contrived. Again, I’m like a completely different person.

I have mental problems that keep me locked in the house.

I'm mostly introverted and I try to enjoy my own company.

Everyone I ever meet has never tried to keep in touch with me.

When speaking online to people I'm ignored most of the time.

So I stay quiet because I already know the outcome.

My councilor has missed two of the meeting we were suppose to have.

Acting like they didn't know they had an appointment.

If anyone read this I will be surprised.

Today was my 21st birthday,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent.

You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down.

"I hate it so much when you try and express your feelings to your parents, but they turn it around and compare your suffering with theirs.","I've been feeling really depressed and lonely lately from my job, I'm a full time late night janitor for a courthouse just 10 miles away from my hometown. Working there has been pretty easy, but I wound up feeling super lonely a lot considering I don't really get to talk to my friends or hang out with them much.

So just today I came home late as usual, and I have a little interaction with my mom after she made a joke to me that I took pretty personal and felts like was more of an insult rather than a sense of humor. I told her that I didn't really want to joke around like that, but she refused to listen and told me to just go away then. Despite attempting to change the topic and explain why I haven't been feeling so high, all she kept doing was telling what a great mom she is for raising me and my brother while struggling to make ends meet and keep the house. What an ungrateful little bastard I am for not appreciating her hard work and sacrifices. 

At that moment I was legitimately about to begin to cry. But rather instead of pausing and trying to reverse the damages, all my mom did was host a little parental style of the oppression Olympics and proclaim her amount of tears and cries over the course of three weeks. I got out just before my first tear would legitimately run down my cheek. 

And even before I went to bed, she goes on about how her life is more worse than ours, then escalates into a more ""This is why you'd make a terrible mistake getting behind the wheel"" considering I had practice driving this morning. Unaware that she had just lite the fuse to trigger the firework, but she didn't seem to care.

"Have you ever seen your friends smile and thought ""Yeah they are better off without me*?","I'll start by saying this : Under no circumstances have my friends ever treated me poorly.

It's been a while since that happened. The bell rang and the break began. So I went to find them and when I did they were laughing so hard (I was in my very lows that day), I felt so nice for them and at the same time I thought ""I can't offer them that"". Before we went back to the classes, I let them walk infront of me because I didn't feel like being 100% in the mood and just by looking at them I kept thinking how great they are together.
Now today I saw some Insta stories of them staying at the house of the one I am closest to and it kinda hit me again. I hope I am not just jealous. It's just that at points I feel like I annoy them when they give me no reason to believe that.

I always tell jokes and laugh and 90% of the time they won't even notice the state of me because of how well I hide it. I love them, yet I am sure they deserve someone who is not like me.  Especially the one I am or used to (yes I am insecure) be closest to. She deserves the world and she's always been there for me but I can't keep being a burden to someone so kind, whom I love so much. I just feel like they ""clicked"" so much better and even though on one hand it kinda hurts on the other it is nice to see them like that.

"""Depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die.""","This was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class. (We have this Facebook group where we submit all our photography works)

**And it just resonated with me.** Depression is such an ass. Struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that I ended up self-harming and nearly killing myself three times this year. And I couldn't do it because I'm too afraid. I want things to end. But I couldn't. 

At this moment, I'm not suicidal. I'm not even at the point that I'm severely depressed to the point I can't function normally. It just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... The fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. The fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. And ultimately, the fact that I realize that its such a miracle that I'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression.

Don't promise a mentally ill person that you'll never leave them.,"It's just fucking cruel.

I first had a best friend who did this, in all fairness it was my fault our relationship downhill but even during that she insisted she'd still be there for me, yet when I eventually decide to try take up the offer to reconnect I'm ghosted.

Then my boyfriend promised me he'd never leave me throughout the 8 months we were together but then he dumps me out of the blue , the half assed stuff he did tell me was likely just because he thought id fucking kill myself if he was truthful. He said he still wants to be there for me but has yet to give off even a sense that he cares, I wouldn't be suprised if he got with the girl he almost cheated on me with right after dumping me.

My point is, never make a promise like this to someone who you know is vulnerable.

I know the post will go down here ... But I have serious problems. I should quit my life.,"First of all ... I have hesitated for a long time just to write everything that burdens me, but maybe it helps just to get rid of everything once. 

About me, 31 years old, I am psychologically completely broken and physically unfortunately also very lediert. 

My life has just gone wrong from the beginning and sometimes I wonder if some people are just lucky and others are not. 

I grew up in an already broken family. My mother was married 3x and divorced 3x (I am the child of the second husband). I can remember almost all the incidents of my childhood (which makes it worse for me) One of the first memories I have (about 3,5 years) my father went after my mother with a knife. And even stabbed through a door with a knife. He was then thrown out by my grandparents and I saw him only once a short time later. He was an alcoholic all his life and did not even try to contact me (even when my ex-wife met him by chance in the hospital 10 years ago and gave him my cell phone number...). Without my knowledge)

In the meantime he passed away about 2 months ago and I knew nothing about him except that he was an alcoholic. 

After he was no longer there, my mother had quickly met someone new, my stepfather. He was 8 years younger than my mother. 

Unfortunately, he was also very aggressive. As a chain smoker he was very quickly annoyed when he had no more cigarettes and has quickly become with things around him, it also did not take long and my mother and he have often and loudly quarreled, often thrown on dishes on the walls. He became unfortunately also now and then Handgreiflich and has beaten me and my brother (whereby my brother was rather his favorite, since he was older and could make more with him). After we have moved several times we lived in a townhouse only then it did not take long that my mother and my stepfather have also divorced. My stepfather had cheated on my mother for a long time with my cousin (yes it does not get better).

After the separation, my stepfather has emptied the joint account and has filed for bankruptcy, because no one could keep the house alone, my mother also had to file for bankruptcy. 

Shortly after that we moved of course, unfortunately my mother lost her job 3 years later and has never found a full-time job again and lives since then on social benefits. 

With my brother (child of my first husband and 3 years older than me) I never had a really good relationship, mostly he didn't want to have anything to do with me and we generally did less together. He was also not at the same school as me, he was never very educated unfortunately. 

He also moved out quite early, because he did not get along with our mother at all and even resented that she separated from our stepfather (because he got along with him). He then moved to another cousin of ours until he was 18 and even had contact with our stepfather. 

Generally he was always very strange. He watched our parents having sex or generally our mother taking a shower. (And played with himself while doing so). He is also said to have had sex with our cousin according to a friend of his. (Probably several times) And has often set fire with a friend together.

He somehow had a kind of mother complex and for many years always looked for much older women who often also had children. But usually it did not last very long. When it was over, he often set a fire somewhere. What I knew about afterwards was his own car, A garden shed, A meadow, and finally an attic of an apartment building, whereupon he was arrested and sentenced. However only on probation. 

His last partner was 11 years older than him with whom he actually held out for 6 years. Only a short time later he had a partner 11 years younger (a complete change of heart). Which was then suddenly pregnant immediately, after the first child a few weeks later she was pregnant again. 

However I had in the people 10 years very very rarely contact with my brother and we have seen us actually only when our grandparents died (who have reached a proud age 92 and 94).

In general, I have also completely broken off contact in the meantime, because after several attempts on my part, no normal relationship can develop between us. I can not even have a reasonable conversation with him, because you just notice he seems to be very stupid (I just can not express it differently).

About me .. I also made a lot of mistakes in life. 

Unfortunately for me, I almost didn't focus on my schooling and did almost nothing in class (my mom didn't care what I did or didn't do anyway, she never showed up for a parent-teacher conference either). 

I wanted to earn money as fast as possible and learned the next best thing and ended up in the camp. My goal though was to become a soldier and joined the army after my training, unfortunately I got a slipped disc there and dropped out 2 years later. 

Then I ended up in a larger company where I had worked until today. 

I started drinking myself very early (15 years), because I myself had a very bad environment, the city I lived in generally had high unemployment and there was a lot of drug dealing. Also through my education I drank almost every day after work and it was later to the point that I completely shut down 4 times a week and had a blackout several times. This was no better in the armed forces. Was able to make the leap in my mid 20's though and quit. I don't even drink beer in between anymore because I just don't feel like it. I also take my other drugs (although I sometimes wonder if maybe I should). Or smoke either.

I have always tried in my life to escape into some relationships, because I could not be alone ... My first relationship lasted 5 years circa and I was married myself and had to divorce and have a son. 

My ex-wife, however, always wanted to make life difficult for me and I got deeply into debt because of her, since she, among other things, never completed an education. Just like that, she quit her jobs and I was the sole breadwinner and often signed contracts and did not pay them, whereupon I received debt collection letters. 

I had to declare insolvency at some point, because we also had a joint loan running.

I had also met a new woman half a year later and moved. Only my ex-wife really sabotaged this relationship and it didn't last long. Also because I wanted to see my son regularly.

I then decided to stay alone for 2 years, but lived near my ex-wife again because of my son. 

When I met my current partner, I decided to finally live my own life and not always be there for others. And moved a little further away. Got another wonderful daughter and everything looked like it was going uphill.

Also this time my ex-wife has tried to make our life hell, which led to the fact that I have quarreled with my partner very often and now also have no contact with my son for a year. 

My job has also deteriorated more and more, because the company was bought up 3x and changed. The work climate has made me more and more broken and I had a second herniated disc. 

In addition, I was then admitted to a day clinic, because I was also psychologically at the end. After a few months there, I was diagnosed with trauma therapy and was also diagnosed with bipolar narcism. 

I discontinued this therapy a year later because it didn't help me at all.

In the meantime, however, I have screwed everything up ... I had to give up my job for health reasons, although I have a GDB of 30% and was equalized. I am also about to lose my partner, because there is more and more crisis between us. I really don't have anyone in my life anymore. 

I have moved 13 times in my life in general. And have lost a lot of contacts and friends. I also lost some contacts because of my ex-wife. 

I generally only have contact with some friends I met online or old work colleagues. 

I also see my mother about 1-2 times a year but I don't care if I see her at all or not. But she understandably wants contact with her grandchildren.

I must also say to myself, I was a very difficult personality from a certain point and also my friends and partners had to learn to deal with it. I always had the urge to somehow talk nonsense and can hardly ever stay serious about anything, even when I write this text. You could subordinate it under ""joke addiction or Moria"". I also have a very low frustration threshold and go crazy quickly if I just drop something. Unfortunately I'm also very forgetful and often don't know what I'm supposed to do several times a day. (I probably owe that to the alcohol). All in all, due to narcism I often have the impression of being emotionally dead. I cry in the rarest situation at all (even if sad videos still carry me away). I can hardly show empathy towards others. I also really don't care about much and I notice it more and more. That I really don't care about anything that happens. Apart from my children, I have never really had the feeling of being happy. In general, almost nothing good has ever happened to me. 

Conclusion: So now I wonder does it even make sense for me to exist? 

I am insolvent I have a divorce behind me. My partner will leave me soon. I have no job anymore. No friends . And probably soon no more apartment (since I then the insolvent also no new apartment more find). 

EDIT: 

First of all, thank you all! 

You have really touched my heart, even if it is hard for me to admit something like that. 

You don't have to worry about me doing anything to myself! 

I don't want my children to have a horrible childhood like me! 

Besides, for your love! You are really great and I understood that there are things in life worth living for! 
Of course, I will also seek professional help. 
It is not very easy to get appointments here but I will keep at it and not give up! 
I know I can't change my past but I can change my future!

My inbox has exploded with messages and I have already replied to some. Even if I wanted to, I probably won't manage to reply to every single one.

"Whether I live or die, the world will remain unaffected.","I won't be missed by more than the two people who I depend on.

People will continue to justify life's arbitrary and meaningless cruelty with fantastical explanations. They will continue to center their lives around those fantastical explanations.

By chance of birth, some people will continue to live great lives and others will continue to suffer. The lucky ones will go through life engaged and curious, and the rest will gradually be beaten down by rigidity, conformity, or cruelty.

The endless, toxic, and useless discourse that has come to define online life will not cease.

The universe's countdown to extinction won't stop.

Babies will continue to be born into abuse, never having a chance.

People will continue falling in love, every kiss taunting my lonely time on this Earth. 

In an effort to fight against meaningless absurdity, people will continue to hate and wage war.

Billions of farm animals will continue being bred into existence, with all their capacity to feel pain and terror intact, only to live cramped and miserable lives that end in systematic slaughter.

Romantics will continue to write music and poetry in an attempt to offset the suffering that has come before them and will continue to come after.

I can't take this anymore. We were all born into hell. The lucky ones are the ones who are naive enough to roll their eyes at the preceding sentence. I can't believe I was born with the capacity to feel so much, only to be burned and tortured for such a long time as to only have the negative feelings left intact. I can't believe someone with so many hopes and dreams has no grace bestowed upon him, only the same oblivion that everyone is forced to face sooner or later.

I can't do this anymore. I want to scream but no one will listen. I can't believe the level of helpless agony that so many of us are forced to endure. Why. Just fucking why. I haven't felt loved and safe in 10 years, since I was 17. That's not an exaggeration. I can't fucking believe this is my life.

I could sit here and ramble about my fucking woes and horrible life circumstances, but I'm just... tired. Tired of explaining myself, tired of trying, tired of feeling like my heart is being ripped out of me.

To those of you who actually said something nice... thanks, but I've heard it all before. ""It could be worse"", ""I care about you"", ""It gets better""... It doesn't feel like it. Every time I end up feeling ""better"" my depression comes back worse and worse sooner or later. The self harming gets worse The thoughts of ending it all persist.

So.. what I'm trying to say is... I'm unfortunately still alive, and I still wish I wasn't.

Edit 2: I am alive. I've been on meds and I'm in therapy, but I'm looking into intensive outpatient care and will switch therapists once the evaluations I wanted to get done are done. I'm still holding on, somehow. Lots of you have helped. I still wish I didn't have so much pain and anxiety and sadness in my brain and body, but... some of you have inspired me to do something I hope will mean something to you. What that thing is, I'm not entirely sure yet, but it feels good to know people out here might actually want to see it.

Do you guys ever have intrusive thoughts about what a horrible person you are over past mistakes that nobody even remembers or cares about?,"Since this pandemic began, I've been experiencing a lot of guilt and remorse over very trivial, cringy stuff I did when I was a kid. Even though I realize how ridiculous this is, my mind still convinces me I am a terrible person, worthless and undeserving of happiness and that I don't deserve to take care of myself. 
This has begun to affect my concentration and I've been losing sleep.

I was just wondering if anybody else is experiencing this? Is this a symptom of depression? Is it my low self-worth? I don't know why I feel this way. Does anyone have advice?

Thank you in advance. I'd be appreciative of any advice I can get ;-;

Edit: Guys, ty, ty, thank you for the support ;-; ❤️!! I just want to quickly say that reading the comments made me feel less alone in my struggle. It breaks my heart knowing others are going through the same thing. I took you guys' advice and spoke to someone I can trust about my stupid past actions and well, they thought I was worrying over nothing. This really made me feel relieved as I thought they'd be ashamed of me or something. It's crazy what your mind can convince you of. That being said, starting tomorrow I'll be working on my sleep schedule and treating myself better. If that fails, I will seek therapy. Good night guys, I can't thank you enough and I wish you all the best. I appreciate you all so much you lovely human beings

Edit: I'm so glad to hear that some of you are also reading the comments on here and feel a sense of relief that this is more common than you thought, honestly I had no idea either! There's some great advice on here guys and I'll make sure to read back on it if I ever start to doubt myself again.

People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies.,"UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Thanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.

"One of, if not the worst things about being depressed, for me, is that I have to force myself to do basic shit. I have to make an effort to maintain my body for example, or just get outta bed. Everything is labored and thought about beforehand. No enthusiasm even for hobbies. Force myself to do them","So everything is labor in that way. I don't think people who don't have depression truly understand just how uphill it can seem. When everything has to be forced to be done or it just won't get done. It's exhausting and I'm already exhausted.

A good way to describe it would be everything feels like resistance against the depression. Every action I take as a depressed person is actively going against the depression. Have to fight and resist it and not be consumed by it. And it's exhausting. Always feeling that you are pushing up against something and trying to claw your way out instead of just acting freely without the weight of that.

I’m fucking sick of my life but I’m too scared to die.,"I just hate everything. I’m so tired of the same old boring life that causes me to suffer. 

Every day I am forced to do things I hate, talk to people I hate, go to places I hate and to put on my fake smile and pretend everything is ok. Lately I have noticed that I’m being irritated by almost everything. I just can’t stand it anymore. 
I hate everyone around me, I hate society, I hate this world, myself and my existence. 

I can’t remember the last time I was honest with someone about the way I feel. If I stop acting like I’m ok and someone notices I’m not feeling well, I’ll just say that I’m tired or my head hurts or other shit like that. It’s not like someone fucking cares about how I feel anyway, it’s all fake and pointless. 

I absolutely hate myself because I’m worthless. I’m ugly, I have no talents except being useless and doing absolutely nothing. I can’t even stand looking at myself in the mirror. 

Everything has lost its meaning lately. Does my existence even matter? If I suddenly disappear it would be better not only for me but for the world as well. 
I don’t even want to pursue my dreams anymore. I don’t want to achieve anything anymore. I just want it all to end. 

I have been thinking of killing myself for a while now, everyone will die when they reach a certain age, what does it matter if it’s now or then? But there’s one thing that’s preventing me and that is my fear. I’m scared of death and pain. I’m scared of what will come after I die.

I really hate when people invalidate a depression diagnosis as someone being lazy and etc.,"""depression doesn't exist"" ""you just want to be special and quirky"" ""you stay in bed all day cause you're lazy"" ""most people diagnosed with depression don't even meet the diagnostic criteria"" ""why can't you just be happy?"" ""depression is just an excuse""

&#x200B;

I think I've heard it all at this point. Really if depression doesn't exist, is that why I lay in bed all day starving myself? If depression doesn't exist, is that why I leave the duty that is showering at weeks at a time? I didn't realize being smelly was special and quirky.  If depression doesn't exist, is that why I won't leave my house? Do you honestly think laziness is the reason I was reported as a missing person to the police? If depression doesn't exist, why do I cry when I glance at myself in the mirror. Why am I isolating myself from family and friends? Why did I cut into my wrists? Why did I abuse substances, if depression didn't exist?

&#x200B;

An open letter to all those people out there saying ""just be happy"". That's cute. You've probably had a comfortable life, with parents who loved you. Unlike me, whose relationship with my parents has always been toxic. My dad first invalidated my diagnosis at 16 by saying depression didn't exist. He also threatened to kick me out onto the streets, and then again 2 years after that when my anorexia got worse. He just keeps me around cause I have some leftover money from school and he wants it.

&#x200B;

I've come close to suicide a few times. Once when I was 16 and another time when I was 20. Recently it's been on mind, as I'm hitting new lows, but I don't think I could ever do it cause I'm just so in love with my boyfriend. Though, if he ever betrayed me who knows what I'd do. I don't know myself.

My parents told me to kill myself,"My anxiety ate me alive this morning I felt awful and fought with my parents about it. They told me to kill myself so after panicking I took my jacket and left my home. I went to the nearest bridge and sat there with my legs out of the bridge, over the water. For the first time I was completely calm. Every other time I attempted I was as scared as hell and that was the reason I couldn’t go trough with it. Probably I would have done it this time. Instead a woman grabbed me from behind and took me back to the bridge. She even took me home scared that I would try again. I don’t even know how I should feel. I don’t know anything anymore

Edit: I wrote this post in the heat of the moment but I just wanted to tell you that my parents really love me, it was just a difficult situation I didn’t know how to calm myself and they didn’t know either.

If you told me I had five minutes left to live I’d be relieved.,"Posting this from my second account. 

This year has been the worst of my (26 F)  life. 

My dad died a month ago today due to a pulmonary embolism. I’m devastated. I also had my fourth miscarriage earlier this year and my fiancé left me after cheating on me the whole relationship. 
I’m in school to be a teacher and due to dads death it isn’t going well. 

I’ve stopped talking to friends and told them I’ll talk to them after Christmas. I don’t feel like pretending to be fine to appease them. 

I’ve stopped eating healthy and lost all this weight very rapidly. 

I don’t sleep. I stay up late and wake up early. 

I feel like everyone hates me and I’m a failure. I also feel terribly lonely. I just don’t see light at the end of the tunnel and I’m in a lot of pain. 

I’m not suicidal but if you told me I only had a few minutes left to live I’d be very relieved and I’d go as far to say... joyful.

Edit: thanks for all the messages and awards. Every minute I draw breath is a struggle. I wish life would just be over but thank you all for your help. 

My first three pregnancies were conceived in an abusive relationship non-consensually between 16-19. This time was very much different and fiancé was long gone by time I found out but I was happy my parents and I were happy.

I’ve been diagnosed with RA, OA, CPS, Fibromyalgia, neuropathy, PTSD, osteopenia, high blood pressure, anxiety, severe depression, degenerative joint and disc, and a few others. I’m not looking for sympathy, just setting the stage. 
My wife of 22 years was present for each diagnoses, as well as my younger daughter. She promised it would be okay when I gave her a chance to get out and find a better man. I worked 14 to 16 hour days for 27 years trying to do what we needed done. Now, she says I’m lying about the problems. I’m on disability and can barely walk.

"You can't kill yourself, think of your family!","Yup, no shit. Every time I would ever come out as suicidal, that's always the first thing they say. The crutch for my existence is reliant on others wanting me to struggle in the same foggy waters that I've been struggling in for years. I know they're trying to help, but it doesn't help, it just guilts me into a corner and leaves me being perpetually sad all the time. It leaves me with the impression that if I sever ties with everyone to the point where I am, in their eyes, irredeemable garbage, that maybe I'll finally be free from my death causing pain to others. At least that was my impression before I realized the hard way that it would only shift the pain from my death to my actions. So even if I get lucky, and my suicide was clean, It will never be painless. So, for now I'm trapped, there is simply no solution other than think about wanting to die and feeling selfish right after.

Edit: I sympathize for the people in this thread who's parents are part of the problem.  That makes this statement much, much worse. The people trying to help are effectively assuming that you have the same loving parents and probably tell you things about their parents you would kill to have for one day. That sounds like a rusted knife to the chest, and I'm sorry you have to deal with that. To people with worthless, unsupportiave parents, I hope you can get out of that situation as soon as possible and find a support group. And I hope the cretins that drive their kids to suicide eventually receive the same torment that they have dished out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kctnhy/you_cant_kill_yourself_think_of_your_family/,depression
Regular Check-In Post,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support. 

If you have concerns or questions about community business or moderation, please talk to us [in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression) before you make a post about it.

I know this post will be ignored but at least I tried. At least I tried to get help from my parents, friends, school, hotlines, reddit but nobody wants to help. The only person I had left was my bf but yesterday he just said he feels like all he is is a therapist to me. It really broke my heart into a million pieces. Because I dont have anybody else to talk to and he always said it was okay for me to vent to him. 

My parents called me a freak and a weirdo, said that I need to snap out of this and get over myself, after they saw my stupid blog about my depression when I was 13 (idk why I made that - 13 yr old me was questionable) they got enraged. When they saw my self harm at 14 they got really mad. The tension in the house and the shame was unbearable, I couldnt look at them in the eyes and spent most of my time hiding in my room. Now I act like I'm fine and happy all the time, we talk about other stuff and joke and laugh together, and its massively improved our relationship. I'm grateful to have parents I now get along with. But it's only because I hide my mental health. Lately things have gotten so bad, its getting hard for me to hide it from them. I'm forgetting to do things they told me to, I'm losing things they lent to me, they're getting pissed off when I didnt mean to. I'm not doing this on purpose. Got mad because I didnt phone my grandma to thank her for some money. Of course it came across as rude and I felt so guilty. My whole family probably thinks I dont care about them. I feel like shit but they dont want to know the truth.

My friends - they all have it bad. Bad home lives, mental health problems, every single one of them, and I'm always trying to help them. But when I tried to open up they treated it like a competion and didnt even ask what was up with me just said they had it worse. I havent spoken to them in weeks because I'm so depressed and nobody even checks up on me to see how I am. It's hard to pretend im happy and smiling and laughing so I dont talk to them. I'm not okay but they're not in the right place to help me they need help themselves.

It's getting really hard to socialise. I talk to my boyfriend everyday and it's just so so so hard to talk and do normal things with him, I try to cover up how bad I'm hurting but sometimes I crack, he said it was okay for me to vent anytime but it looks like I did it too much and he says he feels like a therapy buddy. I feel so fucking shit that I cant even get my shit together.

School is so difficult. I log onto my live lessons and sit there and listen to my tutor saying ""mental health matters guys!"" When their school counsellor wont even bother to show up. Time and time again the school counsellor has cancelled on me LAST MINUTE or during class when we cant use our phones, or just simply not been there. My mental health doesn't fucking matter to the school does it. They say ""its really important we look after our wellbeing"" so they suggest going out for a walk, breathing, taking breaths and ""talking to someone"", well we already know that's not fucking possible. But the other tips are just really basic level things, they don't bother to invest deeper into mental health and help people with genuine problems because they might not have superhero parents that can get them to the doctors or therapists, they only tell us how to ""look after our wellbeing"" when I'm doing all those things and it's gone beyond that. I'm REALLY doing badly. And they dont care. They just expect you to get on with it. So I get told off for not participating in my live lessons. Well I'm sorry that I tried to reach out for help because you said mental health matters and yet I got nothing so you now you expect me to act okay and surprise surprise I cant fucking do it. I cant switch off my mental health for you, school. There is no place in school for people like me when they expect you to be motivated, high achieving, focused, participating, just always okay, and I cant do it!!! And I know this will transfer into the real world, the working world, they always expect you to be okay. And it's not like I want to walk around looking all miserable, but it's just getting so hard to keep that happy mask on all the time.

I have a university interview coming up soon. I dont know if I can do it. I'm so broken and suicidal that I dont think I can act all enthusiastic and persuade them I'd be a great, passionate, hardworking student when I can barely do my schoolwork and struggle to even get out of bed, dress myself and eat.

Theres so many signs I'm struggling. And nobody cares. If you're lucky, they will say they do, they spit out the cliches, give you the useless suicide hotline number and move on with their lives. In most circumstances you have to shut up and act like you're okay your whole life. There is no place in the world for people like me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/l9bq7t/could_1_person_just_read_this_its_getting_harder/,depression
I don't know myself outside my mental illness,"Is hard to think that I can improve and get better when I've had either anxiety or depression since I was 12. I've read some people that have beat depression as 'getting my old self back' but I don't know how that feels like, idk. It's hard to think that I will ever be able to achieve that when there isnt an 'old me' that actually enjoyed life. 

Having some bad weeks lately, thank you if you read this little rant.

EDIT:   God damn I wasn't expecting all this attention. I'm really new to reddit so I'm just, kind of speechless. I've been reading **all** your comments and advice and let me just say thanks so so much to every single one of you. You took the time to answer and help me when I was feeling sad and hopeless. Even if it was to say that you are in the same situation, you made me feel understood and less alone. I will try to be patient with myself and, as some of you said, work to get better so I can 'discover' myself little by little. It's a long, long road, and right now it seems so hard and impossible, but I will try nonetheless. 
I will continue answering all the comments I can, but I wanted to add this first.

"Do you also feel like this, totally neutral and absolutely bored with life, feeling that nothing has real substance and colour ?"," 

Hello folks, I feel a certain way since years and I try to muffle it as hard as I can but it's getting impossible and I wanna know if you feel like this too, or what is it.

I've always found interest in quite everything and i've tried to do everything around me that I was actually able to (psychologically or physically speaking).  
But I can't get invested in anything I do. Any activities that I do are short and if they go on for too long I get bored.  
I force myself to do quite everythings, I force myself to feel emotions (like happiness when I get a gift or happiness when I win on games) and the only emotions that are spontaneous and ""real"" from me are frustration and absolute void.  
When I don't force myself to live emotions out of peer pressure, I feel absolutely neutral and quite sad about life.  
Everything seems washed out and boring, literally everything.  
Nothing stimulates me or give me a feeling of pleasure or joy.  
Nothing really interests me and I feel like i've done everything that I HAD to do in my life and I only see one option now : that it's over !  
(I don't wanna suicide even if sometimes I think about it, I won't do it because I don't want to but it just feels like life is meaningless now and it's the only logical choice)  
I got the checklist done, everything else is purely boring and non stimulating, so I don't really wanna live anymore.  
Because literally everything that I do makes me suffer, even writing this text.  
Because I feel like it's useless and boring.

Is that just depression in a way ?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ki4i70/do_you_also_feel_like_this_totally_neutral_and/,depression

I feel so guilty for having depression when I’ve not really had anything traumatic happen to me and there’s so much evil going on in the world,I don’t deserve this life,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/n4a5iz/i_feel_so_guilty_for_having_depression_when_ive/,depression
My therapist cried in a session and another therapist told me to quit her ASAP,"I have been seeing my therapist for a few years but just started recently feeling comfortable enough to open up about my past trauma to her. Upon doing so, she cried. She did try to hold it back but eventually she cried then immediately apologized and told me that I remind her of her daughter and she cares about me. It honestly was the first time I've felt love from a parental figure.  

However, during that time I was actually having a mental breakdown. I was reliving my trauma everyday and it impacted my work greatly. My boss was not understanding and my physichiatrist eventually recommended a extensive therapy group with a ""great therapist.""

This therapist was not at all what I expected. She was incredibly into the ""tough love"" approach. She made everyone go in a circle and talk about their most traumatic moments. I have social anxiety and these were strangers so I did not really participate in that. But I did talk about my therapy experience and my coping mechanisms and such. She eventually found out that my therapist cried once in a session. She told me that was ""beyond unprofessional"" and that I should ""drop her immediately."" 

I actually did end up dropping her only to get a horrible experience with another therapist. One recommended by the therapist that told me to drop my initial therapist. 

I was so sad and eventually went back to my initial therapist. I haven't seen anything wrong but I can't get help but feel insecure about my own decision. Am I making the right choice? Is it okay to go to someone cause they feel like a friend you can open up to? Are emotions bad and unprofessional for a therapist to express?

*LIL' UPDATE*

Wow! Thank you all so much for the comments and awards. It was so nice to read all of your experiences, I'm so overwhelmed with happiness rn to not feel so alone!   

I have seen 8 therapists in my life and I have never felt this comfortable with one. It honestly was the first time I haven't regretted telling a professional my personal trauma. Although not everyone agrees with this approach, her emotion ultimately showed me that I have people that care about me and it really helped me in a time when I really just needed compassion.

With that being said, I am continuing to see my empathetic therapist as that is what works best for me. 

Thank you again for all of your reassurance and encouragement in helping me choose what's best for me. I struggle a lot with decision making so I was really in my head about this. Anywho, just wanted to say you are part of a wonderful community here and I hope you all find happiness/peace.

My dad told me stop being depressed because it's embarrassing him.,"Last year On November 21 I attempted to kill myself and winded up in hospital the next day , I was still drowsy from the pills I overdosed on and could barely see let alone hear a thing .
 I was so weak I couldn't even walk , I had to use a wheelchair, I went to the hospital bathroom (still in the drowsy state ) and came back to find both my parents sitting by my hospital bed .

Keep in mind my mom is a single mom and has been raising me for years now , I only saw my day once and at most 5 times a year so I was not expecting him . I got to the bed , sat down and my mom gave me a very worried and concerned look but befire she could say anything my dad open his mouth ...

His exact words were , ""Stop being depressed,  it's embarrassing me and I don't want to deal with your nonsense ."" 
That broke my heart , I knew he didn't care but I didn't think it was that bad , I was still in my drowsy state but the moment he said that I think I might be woken up a little . The rest of the conversation with them was a blur but I just remember being so fixated on what he said to me .

That was the last time we spoke , he didn't even wish me a happy birthday this year . I'm only 14 , he broke what little hope I had of us finally reuniting as daughter and dad , I didn't have alot of hope to begin with but damn.


Edit : Thanks for all the positive comments .I didn't the the post would get as much attention as it did with that being said  I'm thankful , you guys were so nice and supportive in the comments .  

To those who have gone/ are doing through something similar or even worse  ,  I sincerely hope you get better , you are loved and appreciated and from the bottom of my heart I'd like to say that you are cared for and  I'm so sorry if anything makes you feel weak or not good enough . 
You are worth it and you are strong and if you feel you are being invalidated and ignored please talk to someone , there will always be someone who cares about you're mental health .",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g2ojjp/my_dad_told_me_stop_being_depressed_because_its/,depression

I never understood why the suicide rates went up during Christmas time... now I do.,"I've always had depression, for as long as I can remember. But this year it's getting a bit worse I might say. I'm kinda in a haze, it's all foggy, my brain feels like cotton, I'm numb and in pain. I'm here but at the same time I'm not, I'm not myself anymore. The depression is choking me, the anxiety is killing me. I don't want Christmas to come this year.   
I  have this feeling that I don't want to be here to celebrate Christmas this year. People are nagging me about what I want for Christmas... I have no answer, because I don't need or want anything and I don't want to be here to open them anyway. Whenever I get a present from someone, I just feel guilty. Because trashy people like me doesn't deserve it, I just feel like a burden for everyone around me. I'm a waste of space, waste of oxygen. The guilt of taking up space is getting worse by the minute.   
I've told most people in my family I don't want any presents this year. They don't know it's because of the guilt. I'm tired of all the guilt! Guilt for breathing, existing, for being stupid and just for being me.  
People around me has been decorating for Christmas these past few days, I haven't. I don't care and I don't see the point.  I don't want to celebrate Christmas this year. I see no point. No joy, no happiness, no... nothing.   
Now I understand why people kill themselves around Christmas. 

My lack of will to live is kinda scary. It's never been so deep and strong before. The fact that January is gonna be financially hell doesn't exactly make it better. I don't want to live to experience January. I can't, I can't afford it. I can't handle it! Oh here we fucking go again, my brain is getting on overdrive and running around again. Push it away, just push the thoughts away. Cut, bleed and shut off my brain.

I hate it when people say “well occupy yourself” when you’re depressed.,"People often say to take your mind off depression, go do something. Play music, focus on school, etc. But the issue is that these are all just blank substitutes that comes crashing down. Just as alcohol is a temporary fix (although it is destructive), using music, exercise, etc is JUST as pointless. I work out and then I feel great and then afterwards, I remember my situation and my life and I feel depressed again. If it’s not resolved, NO amount of “substitutes” can help. All these activities are are just temporary bandages on a wound that can’t close.

I am the singer of a pretty well known band and I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day,"Hi everyone. Like I said in the title, I am the singer of a pretty well known (european) band. Before this year we had shows almost every other week. It's fun, rewarding, great in almost every aspect. When I am on stage I am unbeatable, unkillable. But as soon I get off, I rarley talk to my bandmates, try and avoid fans and get as drunk as I possibly can. I wouldn't say that I have a problem with alchohol since I rarely drink unless it's after a show or a special occasion. I currently live with my gf of 1(soon to be 2) years. I love her but I can't talk to her about my feelings. Whenever I try to be open with her I get cold feet and chicken out.

I suffer, like many of you, in silence. My life might seem pretty alright from the outside, but from the inside I just want to fucking die. My music is embodiment of my feelings, hatred, sadness. Sure that helps me vent but I cannot for the life of me escape myself.

I also have an evil circle hanging over my head. I need to feel this hatred and sadness and shit and bile in my soul to be able to write. If I feel happy, on the rare occasion, I can't write. And if I can't write, I can't perfom.. See my problem? I want to be the embodiment of my art. I want to experience this pain to be able to write and perform it. This comes at the price of wanting to die every single day. How can I escape or deal with my emotions, when I use them to make a living?

Edit: I am moved by everyones effort to help. I can't do much to thank you but here is a poem that I wrote a while back. It won't rhyme in english but I hope that doesn't bother you.

You hold the suns warmth in your hand

when you touch me I become your man

to be thawn is not easy

the cold bites and doesn't feel right

if you've been frozen for all these years

a layer of ice to cover the wounds

you melt my heart you melt my soul

unlocks life and a whole new world

I love you with all my power

even though I never told you

&#x200B;

with the sun's rays dawns a new day

but there was something you didn't want to say

for cold winds can troubble a flame

you wanted to tell but not to hurt

when the warmth had gotten so weak

you said that it was I who had ended the day

that the frost and ice had put out your flame

you left no please stay

for a sun needs fuel and a spark

a chill needs only a coffin",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ive8e5/i_am_the_singer_of_a_pretty_well_known_band_and_i/,depression

I finally went to see a psychiatrist and he straight up told me I don’t have a mental illness.,"I’m sorry if I sound mad and this is a rant, I’m fucking furious. 

So after 3 months of waiting, many years of putting all of this off, I finally get to see a psychiatrist. I drove 2 hours to get here, spent 20 bucks on parking, and I was told to fuck off. 

This guy could barely speak English, but all he talked about was how cannabis is bad and all my problems are from cannabis.  

I’ve been smoking daily for 2 years now, and Ill admit, it is a problem. But I’ve literally been dealing with mental health issues my whole life. 

He wouldn’t even let me speak and when I did he was just drawing on his notepad. He would just tell me that it’s cannabis and I need to go to rehab and once I stop smoking I’ll be fine. 

Bitch, I’m not fucking fine. 

There were so many things I needed to talk about, I literally think I have autism, and when I brought it up he didn’t even acknowledge it. I wanted to talk about anxiety issues and ADHD and ptsd, but apparently I have none of those and it’s just cannabis.  

My favourite part of the whole meeting was when he told me I just need a mom. I literally responded with, “well no shit, but my mom literally just died a few months ago so that’s not really an option.”

I’m so fucking pissed. My life is literally going to go no where and I’m never going to get help, so this is fucking fun.

I passed out and woke up in the ambulance strapped to a gurney, confused, sobbing, and hysterical. My housemate got home early and found me. I was admitted into the ICU, spent my birthday, Christmas, New Years, etc in the psych ward for three months going through ECT.

I don't feel like I have any genuine friendships or relationships with anyone anymore.,"I don't know if these are just symptoms of depression, but I feel so distant from people that I used to consider friends. They never come in contact with me and I can't bring myself to contact them either, and when I do, it's often just short lived conversations or I end up being left on read. My main circle of friends kind of broke off, and now they never seem to plan anything with me. I feel so alone, but at the same time, it feels so hard to talk to people or even get out and try to meet others. As for finding new friendships and relationships, I feel like I've met someone but I find it so hard to trust them and I feel so scared all the time that it's never going to work out or if they're even interested. I honestly feel like I'm not even a priority for them but I feel so guilty and self-absorbed for feeling this way. I don't know if I should tell them because it might make me feel clingy.

The most depressing part about turning 30 is when you start thinking “this really is my life after all”,"When you’re 18, you can make mistakes. You have the time to fix them. They don’t define the rest of your life. You have a decade + to build a life for yourself. There is always that hope that one day, things might turn out well for you. There is excitement. Life is full of colour, but off in the distance you see a storm and road in greyscale.

Then you turn 30 and suddenly the road ahead that looked dark and stormy ahead of you IS the road you’re now walking down. And all you can see is darkness for the next 50 years of your life.  Nobody is coming to save you or bail you out. 

I would give anything to go back and do things over. But there is no reset button, you can’t start a new save file. All you can do is turn off the game.

For people in their late teens/early twenties - don’t waste a moment. Appreciate the time you are living in and the fact that you have several important years to work with.

My therapist thinks I'm too depressed for therapy,"So my therapist that I've only seen two times thinks I'm not a good candidate for therapy. She thinks that I'm too depressed for it despite being on heavy medications that I'm going to see a doctor about and re-evaluate in a few weeks.

She didn't think that a combination of psychotherapy and medications combined would work for me. Instead She suggested ECT treatment after only talking for 80 minutes total.

After doing extensive research this is only offered AFTER you have tried a combination of both therapy and meds and have psychotic symptoms and have a high risk for suicide, all of which I don't have. 

I am severely depressed but my life is incredibly stable for the first time in my life. I know how to handle my depression and my anxiety and do so very well (which she agreed on, mind you) but she still thinks I'm too depressed and she's afraid therapy might make it worse. 

I've done CBT before (only for my anxiety) so I am well aware it might get much worse before it gets better. Yet the CBT was very successful and no matter how hard it got and how badly I wanted to quit, I still showed up for every single appointment and did every homework I got. 

I am not a quitter nor will I ever be. 

All I want is some help to get better without frying my brain. Is that too much to ask for? Am I unreasonable for thinking that psychotherapy and trauma therapy might be a good place to start?

my mom doesn't take my mental health seriously and ignores what I've tried to tell her. And the reason why I want to commit suicide? Because of my life, my family, school. My mom says everyday that I'm useless, dumb, why can't I be like my brother. She says I'm a disappointment, why didn't see listen to the dreams from Jesus about me being a horrible daughter, how she wished she could abort me when she got the chance. My dad doesn't even do anything to stop my mom. My mom earlier this year pushed me on the floor, and choked me because she was really angry. I feel worthless, and pathetic. I have no friends at school, everyone ignores me, and I have zero social skills, how fun. My extended family doesnt even like me, my mom tells them heavily exaggerated stories about me that makes me look like a bad person. I'm failing math because I dont get any of the material, I tried seeking help, but my dad gets fed up with me not keeping up at his learning pace. I'm ugly, and skinny. My cousins make fun of my body, saying how I look like a flat stick. And on top of that, I can't even think straight anymore, suicidal thoughts and urges have basically took over my life. I feel like the odd person always, I feel disgusted with myself. Like I can't even look at myself without all these negative thoughts flooding in. I'm lonely, 0 social life. I've been dealing with this for 5 years, I cant take it anymore. Im burned out. I have no motivation to keep going. And before you say ""Your family will be sad"" I do not care. I am done. Maybe when I die I can finally seek the revenge I deserve. I just want to die, I'm still surprised that I lived to my 14th birthday. My mom says to ""Pray that I get better"" Or that I'm not reading enough of the bible. I'm SICK of it. She says a demon has probably took over me because I feel the way I feel.

"I've been left out of everything, and someone actually cared.","So, basically, my school is crap.

Teachers don't care about me being left out or bullied half of my time here. I didn't think the students did, until today.

There was an odd number of girls today since one was off, and we had to go into pairs. Of course, none wanted to go with me and neither did any one of the boys. So, I sat at the side and said I was fine not doing it.

However, one of the boys asked why I couldn't go in a three with one of the girls' pairs (if you couldn't tell I'm female, and in my school girls and boys don't like to go together much), but all of them said ""no this is a paired activity""

So he actually got really mad and called them all assholes and said how he noticed how they all treat me like shit and asked if I wanted to go in his pair.

He got a detention (just at lunch break) for swearing in front of the teacher and multiple small children passing by, but it honestly warmed my heart so much and it showed me that maybe there is some good left in humanity, and that someone actually cares.

My girlfriend of 4 years died 2 days ago and I feel alone,"Growing up I had never really been depressed and always tried to look at the positives, but 2 days ago I watched my girlfriend die.  She was my soul mate, we connected instantly when we met at work. I had currently been in a toxic relationship when we met so we didn't date until a year later. But we instantly became friends and after a little bit of drama we started dating.. but I knew by then that she was the one.  She understood me like nobody else and I understood her.  She was good at everything I struggled with and I was good at everything she struggled with. We never really fought we only slightly bickered from time to time but it was never anything serious.We were planning on finishing college and then we were gonna get married.  But we decided to go visit my family's cabin in the mountains with some friends, and on the way home my truck broke down. We called a tow and as he arrived we all stood in the ditch waiting for him to tow it.   Then a speeding car came rushing in and slid on the ice and hit me and my beautiful girlfriend.  Once I  woke up I immediately rushed to her but she was covered in blood and she wasn't breathing.  I tried to give her cpr but she was already gone and I can't stop seeing her cold lifeless face.

I can't see a future without her in it, the thought never even once occurred to me.Because I know she was truly my soul mate, and I will never find anyone like her. I miss her smile and her goofy songs she would sing, I miss the way she would put her feet in between my legs before bed. I miss how she would force me to brush my teeth at night because I was being lazy. I just miss her so much and don't know what to do.

Do you ever feel like depression set you back a few years?,"I'm a sophomore in college right now and I am constantly surrounded by wise people... People who did things with their lives in high school and didn't waste it away crying, starving themselves, neglecting their work... They were able to partake in extracurriculars in spite of nervousness or not being nervous at all. They were able to accomplish things efficiently without attention or memory issues. They were able to make friends without poor social cues.

I had friends who manipulated me and threatened to commit suicide everyday, and even then I never had positive influences to help me. My parents were so busy with work that since my youth I was always alone at home. I have trouble having fun... I can't emotionally feel like a happy person, it's always forced. It doesn't come naturally to me so people didn't like people like me.

I'm too lazy to write this but basically I feel so bitter. I wish I did more so I could show off my potential but nope, I wasn't certain of myself ever. I'm trying to improve but my past latches onto me. ): Sigh.

Edit: I have something to add. First, I am very happy to see that some people can relate to at least the topic sentence of this post. We all feel like we were taken back by years because of some shitty stuff in my past. I also didn't get to finish writing this (because I hadn't the energy to finish) but there were moments where I stopped eating, showering, and brushing my teeth for very long periods of time. I also hid my feelings all the time. When people used to say, ""You don't understand!"" it would hurt so much because I really did in some way, or so I thought. I had speech therapy in middle school and general therapy in high school but I was never very honest because I was always afraid of the consequences. I feel a little bit of pride I guess saying this but I feel like I'm an example of someone who hid all their feelings and just wants it all, like all vomited and shat and sweated and cried out of me until I can remove it completely.

Casually Suicidal,"Do you ever look at yourself in the mirror and think about death? You think about the consequences of it and what people's views are on it. Maybe you have even considered suicide. You brush it off, most likely. That is what most people do. People are scared. I am scared. Who would actually want to die though, right? This is what casually being suicidal is. Can you have suicidal thoughts and want to die at the same time? I have a fear of death. I always have, always will. How is it that some days I want everything to end, but I don’t at the same time? It's my biggest fear but also my biggest relief, my biggest wish. In reality, I just want the pain to stop. Why is everything so difficult? Sure, you would tell me to go get therapy, go get tested by a psychologist or something. As if that advice means anything. You want to label us, as if everyone feels the same thing, people like this are the same. In some ways, sure, they are. But most people don’t want to die, they want it to stop. What, exactly, do they want to stop? People. People are predictable. What other reasons are there for someone to want to go as far as think these awful thoughts? Even good people turn bad. Everyone is bad. Even me. People tell you to talk to others about these feelings, that it will help. But only people who experience these kinds of thoughts would understand, and even then it would give them this negative thing to relate to. Is that really a good thing? To relate, in wanting to die? Back to my point, what can people do? I can’t call myself depressed, because I’m not sad all the time. I can’t say I have anxiety, because I’m not anxious all the time. It goes on. The point of this paragraph is to say, don’t tell people to ask for advice, or say that you understand what they are going through. I always tell people what I’m going through, they brush it off. Talking about it can help. But only for the right people. For people like me, I don’t exactly know if I have specific mental health to blame everything on. I’m just feeling like this, that’s all.

I'm homeless now,"Because I ran away from abusive parents. Never thought I'd actually do it but here I am. I don't want to return. There it's pure hell. It's agonizing to live there. Now I am outside and I will live on the streets. My number one fear became alive. It's incredible how fears and the thing you don't want most to happen actually happen. Life is hell. Life is torture. I don't know what the fuck i will do from now on. Guess I'll be what I feared to be the most. That's it.

EDIT: I took the decision on impulse and I realized that it's impossible to do this on this time of the year. I'm too weak so I gave up. I'll try to calculate my possibilities and think through how I can leave this cursed house. I already regret giving up but what can I do. If I can't find any shelter to get away from here I will try to apply for uni dorm in the next semester. Unfortunately, the country I live in is shit and has little to no possibilities for those in disadvantaged situations. Abuse is considered normal here.

"Bought a gun with my stimulus for suicide, posting some ramblings here because I feel alone. It's long and I apologise for the length","Don't know where to start. But currently I'm in airbnbs using what little savings I have, trying not to think about commiting suicide. I used my stimulus check to purchase a firearm just for the peace of mind of knowing I could do it whenever I was ready, and when I realized how calm that made me, I decided to post here to see if anyone could give me some advice

I live in the desert in Arizona but I grew up in California. I've always felt alone and suicidal since a child. I was raised by my grandparents as far back as I can remember after my mother left to AZ after my half brother was born, years later my half sister was born there. After my grandparents passed when I was 16 I had to move to AZ. I've learned growing up, I was around dangerous settings, and car accidents in infancy and I'm worried that also might be a factor in why my brain is wired this way, on top of the regular stuff.

My grandparents were absolutely loving and seemed to try their best to put me in a better environment. I never told them these feelings because I wanted to be a ""perfect"" ""son"" for them in exchange for what they did for me. My grandpa was an old school cowboy type, traditional conservative..but never once told me I had to be any certain way.

As you can probably tell, polar opposite here in AZ.I have no relationship with my birth father or an idea of what he even looks like (yes no photos) anyways I was told by my parents that my father went to jail for murdering his girlfriend in CA (but he's been out for a few years already? Somehow?) and my mother and step father are convinced I'm a murderous sociopath that's going to kill them all one day randomly.

My step father choked me, and my mother and him pretty much told me to go because I make them feel uneasy. (stepfather kept a loaded gun on him in case he had to shoot me, leading to my airbnb situation) Most days at home I kept to myself in my room, but in October I went back to California for 2 weeks when my depression was hitting it's peak to see if I had hope or needed closure or something. I went back to my hometown and didn't feel any pain, I was happy for once, I was with my girlfriend who I wanted to take to prom back in CA before I had to move, and it feels like ever since I left, my life was in limbo. 

I want to go back to live with her but I need to find a job there as well as a cheap apartment, and it's extremely difficult. However she told me she's been wanting to leave home and get someplace for herself as well, it's honestly the only reason I haven't done it yet but deep down I feel like this won't work out. I have this sense of abandonment so I default to isolating myself and suffer because since childhood I've told myself over and over ""no one really cares about you"" and it still carries with me and still ruins so many of my relationships

But what's really making me finally want to go through with it, is that I did gig work, so I've been getting stimulus and the PUA, so basically money to just sit around doing nothing. I was living at home with my mother so I saved all the money. I have the title to my car (2012 nothing crazy) no debt, no student loans, and a 700 credit score. I was always the chubby kid but since covid I've lost weight (like 60 pounds) smoking weed and drinking water, I can get girls, I lost my virginity, and I'm still absolutely depressed and suicidal. I even put off losing weight for so long because I was so scared if I got in shape and hooked up with  women, & wasn't immediately happy. No Im actually feeling worse because now what? I know self care love is important and a good way to fight depression, but I lost that weight, paid off my car, reduced my debts, etc. The next goal would be to have my own home but that's just adding time to the clock like I did with my weight problem

All of this makes me terrified that what my mother and step father say is true and I should just isolate myself or die. I have NO family, when I was living with my grandparents until 16 no one ever came to visit or help, and at their funeral there was mostly friends from the neighborhood. I don't know aunties cousins uncles or any of that. That abandonment feeling was heightened because of this, because my grandparents, to me, my real parents, were abandoned by everyone when they were sick and dying. It reinforced the idea that this will happen to me too with any relationship/friendship I have. ""No one really cares"" 

I feel like no matter what life will not get better and I won't be happy, just on autopilot bouncing between feelings of absolute torment and apathy. I don't want to live for decades this way and I'd much rather die at peace. Not to mention how in my lifetime I'd be contributing so much pollution and waste to the world for an existence that isn't even appreciative of being alive. One other thing is holding me back is that I'm perfectly healthy and wish I could give all my organs away, I know they have to be on ice but I was planning on shooting myself deep in the mountains at sunset to let my body be given back to nature, but my kidneys could help save a child's life so it feels like a waste and insult 

I'm also very scared of dying and there being a hell and eternal punishment, I was never really religious but my grandma tried to raise me catholic and that fear is still always there. With age my thoughts of suicide went from ""I hate myself and want to die"" to ""I feel nothing and things would be easier for me and them if I was never born"". I don't keep ammo with me because now, I feel like that peaceful mountain death is the only thing keeping me going and as soon I get some ammo Im going on that drive",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/kz4j2r/bought_a_gun_with_my_stimulus_for_suicide_posting/,depression

I drew a comic about my experience with depression.,"Hey all. A couple of years back I had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely.

I isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period.

I still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. I transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. I still feel like garbage a lot of the time but I have to stop thinking that I'm *actually* garbage. I'm trying.

Seeing yourself getting worse and worse and not caring enough to do anything is the worst part of depression.,"For normal people with healthy brains (honestly do those even exist anymore?), whenever things in their life are going wrong, they do what they can to fix it and get better. For those of us who are depressed and do not have that luxury, we've lost interest in caring for ourselves.

There's no clear path on how to fix our lives and the chances of actually succeeding are minimal at best. The amount of effort required is too great and we find life and especially our own lives to be meaningless so why bother trying?

I've grown more apathetic towards life and I really can be bothered to care much about myself. I see my mental state getting worse and life passing me by, bit really I just don't care. I find myself unable to relate to others when they talk about their futures because I genuinely don't see one for myself and I'm not interested in trying to build one. Especially when I have no building materials and no way of obtaining them.

This has to be the worst part about being depressed. It's an illness that makes you not care enough to get help and better yourself leading to a slow decline with endless sadness and misery while your physical health worsens. If that isn't the scariest illness then I don't know what else is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/onc1x2/seeing_yourself_getting_worse_and_worse_and_not/,depression

Called the suicide prevention hotline for the first time ever,"I actually felt suicidal today. Really and truly.

I haven’t told anyone I know and don’t think I will.

I’ve found that being vulnerable with some of the people who I’m supposed to be closest with only gives them more ammunition to hurt me.

And the ones I do trust, well I don’t want to feel like a burden on them.

But, it helped so much. Honestly.

Maybe it’s kind of fake cuz it’s their job and they’re trained to be empathetic and understanding, but it felt SO GOOD to have someone to listen and care.

To give a fucking shit that I am dying inside and so goddamn overwhelmed with almost all the aspects of my life.

I cried so so much. I hid in the closet of my bedroom for some privacy and just poured my all my pain and worries out to the kind lady on the phone.

She comforted me and showed me kindness and concern and that felt so fucking good to just have someone listen.

She said she’ll call in again to check in on me and that feels nice.

Please use the suicide prevention hotline. I was teetering on the edge.

Knowing that suicide is always an option gives me a lot of comfort. Am I weird? How far down that depression rabbit hole am I?,"I don't have a lot to add. I'm depressed, I guess? This has been going on for decades. I don't know anymore. Am I really depressed anymore, or has it turned into something else? I hate being awake. I wake up every day in a state of shock, overcome with dread. I sleep as much as possible, but I have always had insomnia, so I only get a good night's sleep every 2-3 weeks. I snap awake as soon as I start falling asleep. I've tried medication, therapy, and jesus, but nothing has helped. I recently realized that living with my father is a huge source of stress and anxiety for me. He's emotionally and mentally abusive to me every day. I am moving out soon, which is great (I hope), but I am not expecting all my problems to magically disappear. Despite it all, I am working hard to get a good education and build a better life for myself. Why? I honestly don't know. Because it's expected of me, I guess? What do I want out of life? To be happy, of course! But we all know that ""happy"" isn't realistically achievable. Life is never perfect, so I guess I am aiming for something more modest, like contentment. To me, contentment would be a quiet simple life with very little stress. Not a lazy life, per se, but one where there is little or no pressure on me to do things I simply don't want, and don't need, to do.

I will never understand how people can live and be happy,"Life is just objectively bad. Everything seems to be literally designed to bring you down. Even our own bodies are designed to keep us from being content. Think about drugs that make you feel good, eventually your body will reach a point where it needs more and more to reach the same effect. Until you overdose and die. You try to set up goals, you complete them and keep seeking more. You get money, you want more. People say practice graditude, for what? Why should I live a life where I constantly need to remind myself of trivial good things when everything is basically objectively bad? Your loved ones eventually die. You die. People kill each other on a daily basis. Do horrible things to each other. You work until you die. When you are young you have energy and time but no money. When you are an adult you have money and energy but no time. When you are old if you are lucky you have money and time but no energy and most likely riddled with sickness and lost most of your loved ones. Life is always out of balance to kick you down. The only way you can possibly live a nice life is if you are so rich you can just do whatever you want without working and help the ones you love to do the same. What are the odds of that? Almost zero. I'm just tired of it all. I wish I never existed, because life is simply not worth living and I don't think anyone will ever change my mind. No one has been able to help me.

“JuSt Go tO ThErApY”,"I see this here and other subs a lot. People vent about how shitty their lives are going or how they’re feeling (honestly; is anyone having a good time right now?). And the answers are usually: go to therapy. On the one hand, yea therapy is good for mental health shit. But it’s not that easy to actually get in. Especially in my country.

It took me a *year* to find a therapist that wasn’t booked and was open before 9 and after 5. Which was a non starter because lo and behold offices and jobs tend to want you working for them between 9am-5pm so you can’t go gallivanting off to talk to your therapist for an hour. Finally found one and come to find out my insurance won’t cover them. Going to this therapist costs me $99 a week. That’s more than I spend on groceries. I make a decent amount and haven’t yet been sacked because of covid but not many are as lucky as I.

"Not suicidal, just don’t want to live","Anyone else feel like this? You don’t want to end your own life, you don’t have the urge to do it. You just hate life. You wish you didn’t have it.

I feel beyond suicidal,"Anybody else have this? Suicide just feels completely pointless. Infact, everything does. People try to cheer you up and all they do is tell you to ""be practical"" and to ""stop being dramatic"" when you're not even showing any emotion the first place and all you're doing is lying there like a dead fish. Killing yourself is just another desperate solution to something that can't be fixed and even then suicide doesn't do anything except cause more pain to people. Not even dying seems appealing anymore. At this point I just want to lie in bed and sleep. And keep sleeping. And keep sleeping. But I can't even be afforded the option of giving up. If I do, people tell me I'm selfish and stick pitchforks in me. I ask why and the best answer I get for ""keeping going"" is just ""because you have to."" and then people get angry when you press them further because they can't really think of a reason either. It's just a blind desperation to survive we all have, like we're just that important. That need to survive other people have seems to have disappeared from me, and so has the need to die. I'm stuck here in this place and all I want to do is block it all out. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed to piss. We keep going because we have to. But nobody ever tells me why.

I’m always amazed at how much energy healthy people have.,"When I wake up after 8 hours of decent sleep I’m still exhausted. All day, everyday. Not just “tired”. Exhausted.

“Drink water and eat healthy!” again, I can’t even get out of bed. 

I’m guessing the next thing would be “you just have to use self discipline and force yourself to do it!” but...how? It feels as though I physically can’t.

I am currently experiencing the worst my depression has ever been. It’s really difficult to say the least.

Now I'm not looking for any praise because this is something that every adult should do, but I've literally been stuck as too lazy to even take the trash out to the curb except for like once a month. By no means was it a neckbeard den, but it was pretty gross.

I swept, mopped, folded all of my and the wife's laundry, and finally took down the Christmas tree (I know it's May...) amongst other stuff. I'm going to go do some yard work now!

I'm sorry, I really didn't know where else to share because my family thinks I have it together as they never visit, and it would sound ridiculous if I told them how proud I was of something that should be a weekly routine.

well i guess this is techinally correct. no one lives forever

""theres so much to live for""

well maybe for you thats true, but for me who has  lost almost all motivation and ability to feel happiness its not relatable 

""what about your loved ones!""

okay thats just guilt trippy, and either way not everyone has loved ones/support systems just because you do janet 

""just exercise and drink water""

omg...thanks 🤩 /s

""what if something amazing and life changing happens that wouldn't if you died?""

yeah ive been carrying on that hope for years and here i am 

""just put yourself out there""

ive tried, so many times. part of the issue in the first place is that it usually never goes anywhere, and because of my mental health and abandonment issues people are usually driven away. also i completely lack the ability to maintain long term relationships, and have no idea what a healthy one is like in the first place. of course thats all assuming i cant get myself out of bed in the first place, find the social skills i dont have, and stop being an anxious little bitch. 

""god-""

shut up. i respect your religion but please shut the fuck up. 

""choose to be happy""

my ability to choose seems to be locked. should i put it in rice, turn it off and on?

""go to therapy""

"You ever get asked the ""where do you see yourself in five years?"" question in a job interview or something and have to stutter because ""probably not alive"" is the knee-jerk response?","First off, what a stupid fucking question to ask anyway.

That I'm indifferent and stagnant enough to stay with your company that long assuming you hire me or that I'm ambitiously arrogant enough to in five years plan on being well passed this shit?  Fuckin' hell, man.

Undoubtedly there are varying degrees of suicidality just as there are reasons for doing it, all depends on the person.  I suppose I'm the sloth suicidal.  I've tip-toed through and around depression for the better part of my conscious life and I can't help but feel miserable an overwhelming percentage of the time.  Yet, when the obvious solution to this conundrum of despising being alive is ""well, don't be alive anymore"", the meddling safeguards of thinking about the wake of my actions swelling over everything and everyone I leave behind effectively whiteout any sort of blueprint I have for seeing myself out of my life.  Sounds rather counter-intuitive, but I'd rather my last thoughts be more ""you gave it a go, you're not doing anything wrong, you do you, kiddo"" and less ""hey, you're a tremendous asshole for this, I hope you know that.""

I can comfortably say I'm not doing it tonight, or tomorrow, or this year or even the next, but I genuinely feel like that's how I'm going out pending the absence of a freak car crash or lightning strike or some shit.

Don't even really know what I'm trying to say here, but do you ever feel like this?  Like life is essentially an existential clusterfuck that you want no part of, but for whatever fucking reason just can't make any sort of move?

I think my life is destined to end in suicide,"My depression never goes away even though I've cycled through different therapists and medication for 7+ years now. Everything is much worse than before. The slightest inconvience makes me think of ending it all. I've tried 3 times and obs failed :D. I'm only 20 and I feel like an old man who has seen it all. I have had insomnia since I was a child. I can't sleep for days sometimes. It is fucked. And when I do sleep I sleep like 18 hours and still feel tired. It is very hard to keep up with my studies with this. Oh and I'm not in college but still trying to finish high school. It's not going well. I have no job and right now have about 50 bucks to live until january, after I payed my bills. I have no friends, strained relationship with family (basically just my mom, only child, father left when I was a baby) no one to talk to. No one cares about me. It's been like this all my life. Never had a single good relationship with anyone.

This all sucks but is not the why I think I will kill myself . I KNOW all of the things I could make my life go better but I just don't see it ever happening since my mental state never gets better. I've already experienced one psychotic episode. I feel constantly on the edge of sanity. I simply can't live like this much longer. There is no help for me i've tried the ""help"" so many times already. I think I will not make it to my next birthday. But that's alright, it will be a good thing for the world. I already have violent fantasies of just going to a mall and shooting people. It's best to end it before I harm somebody else. I'm not a good person and I wont be missed.

I know it’s an irrational way of thinking, but I’m getting to a point where I’m running out of options.

Warning: Watch out for PMs pushing religion.,"**Update:  We are aware this person has been PM-ing everyone who's participated in this thread with claims that we are lying about their actions.  I hope it goes without saying that we're not.  One of the people who let us know what they're up to used the phrase ""persecution complex"" and the behaviour unfortunately does seem to be consistent with that.**

After warnings and explanations, they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules. After we resorted to banning the account, something we very rarely do here, they announced that they were going to escalate their rule-breaking behaviour.  The sort of person who claims to want to help, but ignores a community's rules while claiming to want to follow them is, in our regretful opinion, exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable OPs need to be protected from.  

If you received any PMs as follow-up to a comment you made on this post, please click ""report"" on all of them as this brings this person's behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.  Thanks. 

***************************************************************************

We've had reports of PM-ing behaviour from a serial religious proselytiser whom we've had to take action against for persistently trying to ""save"" people in this sub.  Their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because it's a way to find a ""community"" - this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic.  Don't fall for it.

**Edit:  I should have worded that last sentence better.  We're not saying that all religion is ""notorious"" or anything.  We're saying that *this particular person* is being deceptive and manipulative, and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way that's representative of the worst types of cultish ""religion"".

"Makes friends -> get close, really get to know them -> alienate them slowly with your issues -> get abandoned yet again several years into another good friendship that you hoped would last a lifetime -> repeat","This pattern has been repeating for over a decade for me. I don't still have any friends from then now. Hell, I barely have any friends left from 5 years ago.

I'm just so sick of it. I thought I'd broken this cycle, but it's rearing it's head again. I'm being told to just make new friends, but what happens a couple of years from now when they get sick of me too and I'm right back here, wallowing in my own feelings of abandonment, isolation, not belonging, etc. all over again?

It just reinforces for me that I don't belong on this planet, that as soon as somebody knows the real me, our relationship (whatever it's nature) is on borrowed time. That I'm just going to be flitting like a pariah between groups I never quite seem to fit into, spending the rest of my life pursuing validation wherever the search takes me next, until finally, almost mercifully, it ends. Just...why bother? If nobody can love me for the real me, and I can't for the life of me mould myself into a shape they can accept, what's the point?

When you reach that point where “what’s wrong?” no longer has an answer,"When there’s no longer any specific thing that you can pinpoint as the reason you’re feeling the way you do.

When you don’t even fully understand it yourself. Why can’t you just be happy if nothing specific happened to ruin your mood?

When you’re so used to feeling depressed that you don’t even know how to feel happy during the moments that are supposed to make you happy.

When the few things you had in life that you used to enjoy either become dull to you or impossible to motivate yourself to do.

When it starts to seem pointless to even try accomplishing anything because you know that no matter where you are in life you will probably still be depressed.

When you can no longer stand speaking to the people you love because it’s either pretend to be happy or ruin their whole mood/day and make them worried about you.

When even the most simple conversations are very hard to get through without being triggered by something and wanting to break down.

When it gets to the point where you have heavily considered abruptly cutting the people you love out of your life because interacting with them is becoming exhausting and you would rather them think you’re an asshole for isolating from them than to give them the even more painful truth about where your mind is going and what you think is inevitable.

When the overall feeling of not having anything in your life that makes you happy anymore starts to be far more painful in your mind than actually having negative things happen to you.

How do you even answer “what’s wrong?” when it’s both not anything and every single aspect of your life at the same time

11yr old son came to me and said he had planned to shoot himself.,"Driving to soccer practice my son told me he had planned to sneak into my room and (somehow) unlock my safe and shoot himself. Then went on to say he no longer wanted to do it.  He cited rejection from kids at school as the main source of his sadness, but as his father I have a hard time not assigning blame to everything I can think of that I might have done differently. I have personally had suicidal ideation issues since about 12 but never gone as far as a plan to actualize those thoughts. Feeling as though I passed a torch but also telling myself that it is most likely other factors ( my therapist agrees with the latter). Any advice for helping a pubescent 11yr old, and not blaming myself for everything ?

Edit: update and more info. 
You guys this chat has been amazing! Thank you to everyone involved and that took time to post! Thought I would give more background to the situation that people have asked or talked about.

We learned he was having suicidal thoughts from his school. My wife is a fifth grade teacher and received a call from my sons school that he had texted another student and mentioned he was going to kill himself. The student told their parent the parent contacted the school.  My wife immediately left with her school counselor to pick him up and take him to her school. He wasn’t saying much and didn’t give any specifics to my wife about plans, just that what she was being told was true.
      That night is when he told me of his plan but that he didn’t want to do it anymore. My therapist said it would be a good idea to get the whole family involved for support, so we also had a family meeting with his two sisters letting them know what was happening. It went amazing and everybody had a good cry and let him know how much he meant to them and how much we would miss him. I also moved my gun safe out of the house to a family members.
   The next day my wife took him to school my with her and went to see the school counselor/licensed therapist. They talked about what was going on made a safety plan and talked about coping mechanisms for him.  He will be having sessions with her regularly. 
   We now have open communication with him about his anxiety/depression levels. His thoughts of suicide he says have been minimal. He did tell me during one talk “I don’t want to die, but my brain keeps telling me I do”. He’s an very emotionally sensitive and has always been. He takes things personally and rejection is amplified because of this. 
   I feel we have moved into a better space around the situation, and he is doing well. 
   Thanks again for all the responses, they have been validating and uplifting. You all are amazing and thank you for the support !",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/rmiync/11yr_old_son_came_to_me_and_said_he_had_planned/,depression

"I don't want to kill myself, I just don't want to exist","My life feels to be falling apart. I don't know how to explain it other than my limbs all being stretched and physically unraveling and dislodging. 

My brain is rot and my insides are rot. Rotted goop. 

I don't have a purpose in life, I have no dreams in life, I'm wasting away the prime of my life. I dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and self-harm. 

Therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain. My psychiatrist is cool but I've tried 15+ meds and nothing really works. 

I can't figure out this big issue in my life and I repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as I sit paralyzed in fear. 

I think I just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways I didn't recognize as I've gone up on this new medication. Talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be. It gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me. I don't care to talk about anything I'm interested in anymore. I used to at least have some interest in certain topics, but now I just don't care and I don't want to talk to anyone. Every word said to me or that I say is a fork on a chalkboard. I have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak. 

I don't care about doing things I used to do with friends. Well, I care less, anyway. Or more like I'm just indifferent. Numbed out... I still care. But it doesn't feel as...there? It feels like I'm wearing emotion-canceling headphones. It's all still there, but it's so muted. 

I can't stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets...

I've lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just don't care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I don't care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I've already failed, I still fail. So what... 

My motivation was already shit but now it's more like I don't care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone, angry about it, in a sense? And now I kind of just don't give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it's still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I don't feel the anger at myself as much. 

Occasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion, like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming, slamming things around and knocking things over and self-harming viciously in a frenzy. 

Some days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. 

Every day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. It's Monday, then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I don't care about any of it. Monday, Wednesday, Sunday...whatever. All the same. 

The best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 2-3 hours. That's literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. 

Everything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode, but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. 

My life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I don't want to commit suicide, I just want to not exist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/og9ont/i_dont_want_to_kill_myself_i_just_dont_want_to/,depression
"I hate how ""Go to therapy"", and ""Start exercising"" are thrown around like they are a magic pill.","Don't get me wrong many have benefited from this, but how many haven't?

It seems that for everyone these don't work they are followed with find a better therapist or working out will just release endorphins to make you feel better or some shit.

If only I had kept all the wasted money on therapy to pay 10 escorts instead, I'd be much better. Going to therapy just made me feel worse, no matter how many different I went to, and I tried group therapy once I felt better(which surprise surprise I got better when I wasn't going regularly to therapy) but that was a big mistake, group therapy fucked me up more, it just made me realize I'm actually even more alone in what I'm going through.

To sum up what was heard in therapy, ex promiscuous people who want love but regularly have sex complaining how they hate who they married and cheat on them acting like they understand the sturggle of a late virgin( I was 23 back then).

Oh and the workout part?

Instead of punching my head and hurting, I now punch myself and see stars and get fucking dizzy, working out just made me stronger not happier, endorphins don't hit me, I rest between sets punching my head.

All this stupid advice thrown everywhere made me even more miserable.

Boyfriend finally succeeded in taking his life Sunday,"My boyfriend of 6 years suffered from extreme depression, anxiety, and OCD. I constantly would lurk on this subreddit looking for insight, hope, understanding...

He begged for death. He finally did it the day before his birthday. He left two teenage girls behind. They're devastated but their dad had pushed them out as far from him as possible months ago during this last episode of depression and anxiety. He was so afraid of them, he couldn't even speak to them on the phone. 

He sought out all types of help-- therapy, behavioral therapy, ketamine infusions, he got sober, exercised daily... We did it all together. For a while it worked. We had about 2 years of what could be called happiness. He still had depressive episodes in the wintertime but they dissolved by the late spring and early summer. This past winter he was so afraid of how bad it was getting... it didn't lift in the early spring and then COVID hit. He had dental issues come up. All OCD triggers. 

He would say to me ""if only it one just ONE thing... JUST my teeth or JUST COVID... maybe I could get through. I don't want to die""

I had to leave for the past few months to help my sister who has two young children while her husband is away in the military. She was leaving the kids home alone (oldest just turned 12) to go food shopping due to COVID. I was also offered an internship until October that I had spent the past year trying to get. I told him I would be back.

He wanted me to leave and stay at the same time. He had tried suicide several times before I left and my soul hurt so bad. Every time I looked at him it felt like I was looking at a ghost. We had him committed to a 10 day treatment facility but it didn't work. I knew there was a chance when I left that I would not see him again. He often told me he knew he was breaking my heart and soul and hated me around sometimes because he wasn't the person he used to be. We talked every single night while I was gone.  I told him since I was away it was okay to talk to me about anything because I could still get a break and had the energy to listen. I did not talk to him the past couple nights leading up to his death. I was with friends and family. I told him I would call him Sunday. He never answered

He was suffering so much. I hope that he is in a better place. Anywhere would be better than here. I just wish I picked up the phone the last night he called. I wish I picked up the phone for the very last time and I could have said I love you. This has been the worst year of my life.

What's the point in asking for help if no one actually cares?,"I did everything right today. I gathered my thoughts. I talked to my best friend. And then I finally went to my husband and told him everything. The suicidal thoughts that have gotten worse over the past two weeks, that I think I'm experiencing delusions and paranoia, that I'm genuinely scared for my safety.

And all I really got was a ""we'll get through this"" and that was it. I mentioned possibly needing to go to the ER or look for an in-patient facility to get help because of how rapidly this was progressing and he told me ""but what if it financially ruins us? What then?"" And I just stopped. It's cheaper to bury me than it is to give a single fuck about me and help me get treatment. 

I did everything right. I fucking begged for help. But it's not that serious until you actually kill yourself and by then it's too fucking late.

My mom died yesterday,"My mom died yesterday night at around 12 am. She killed herself. I can only assume she has schizophrenia. The previous 2 weeks of her death, she was acting totally different, nothing of herself. She was going on about God (she was never religious) and how if we don’t believe in him we are going to hell. It all began from when she was dating this guy Joseph, and when she came home that night she was totally different. 

I now live with just my dad and sister, and all to remind I am just 16. It really hurts she is dead. All I can think about it her death. I cry off and on and some moments I feel fine then others times I feel numb. 

My family is being supportive- but none of them understand this pain. They remind me “it wasn’t her” I know it wasn’t her. My mom would have never done this to us. It doesn’t change the fact my mom is selfish for killing herself. 

I can still hear the gun shot in the bathroom. It hurts to even go into the bathroom to even touch any of her stuff. I mourn with happy pictures of her- still painful to think she would change so fast.

I looked through notebooks of hers, she used to write like it was her life. She wrote lists and lists of things to do, chore lists, grocery lists, activity lists…etc. it was never ending. 

My mom was always full of life, always ready to take on what life gave her. She never considered suicide. 

The night of when she killed herself she was preparing us all night. It hurt to hear her talk like that. She had cuts all over her body and bruises on her thighs from the 48 hours she disappeared. That morning she came home naked and wrapped up in blanket- apparently walking around the city. 

I want to let every one know that no matter what, cherish the people around you and take the sad things seriously. Never forget that that may be the last time you’ll see them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/nvl9fg/my_mom_died_yesterday/,depression

"Right now, killing myself sounds like an ideal idea","My life is stuck. I've been unemployed since April. I'm 25. Since the outbreak, my family with whom I still live, mainly my father, is putting so much  emotional stress on me, yet, without that stress, I don't think I would've gotten to where I am now. You can say the pain has pushed me to do stuff ( I started working on myself, meditating reading more, trying to excercize, damn I've started painting watercolor. I don't how we do it, but we always find away to misinterpret one another in my family, assuming the worst in the other, we lack communication (but isn't that something to blame on the parent for not initating it in childhood?) I don't know where I am right now, but the idea of not existing anymore is tempting me so bad. I'm tired of thinking. I know I won't do it, but man these thoughts, they stick around once they hold onto you, don't they? It's different when you want to end your life because your life sucks and when you want to end it because there are things you don't want to deal with anymore. I don't know, it lacks the self-pity. Feels almost like an act of self-love.

I'm old now. I look back and I don't remember ever growing up. I have 2 DWIs, an entry level job still, no college degree and I live at my mom's house with her fiance who I can't stand.

Any money I make I either spend it on video games or shopping and I racked up over $30k in debt.

I don't have a point or goal in my life and I feel like I'm already dying. 

I could have been something good in my life but here I am alone again. Every single woman I've been with has left me. 

I can't fucking sustain or follow through with anything. I didn't get a degree, I don't finish the projects I start, every idea I've had has never completeled, I've never fit in socially and at the time of writing this post, I don't see any real will to live.

I'd never kill myself because the people that do care about me would be hurt and I care about them way too much to hurt them, so instead I'm just floating through life, barely surviving, with no retirement, I'll probably die while still working as an old man.

I'm a pitiful 35 year old man and I just wanted to let everyone know. I don't have any reason to move forward and even if I did, I'd never follow through with it anyway.

Nonetheless, I am grateful to each and every one of you, and each and every one of your words. For the first time in months, I do not feel so alone. Thank you.

&#x200B;

Despite all the years of meds and therapy and crisis counseling and being told ""things will get better, you're a beautiful strong woman and everything will turn out wonderfully if you just have patience""-I can say that, with less than six months until I turn 40, I feel no less depressed than the day I was hospitalized, at age 12, for trying to kill myself via starvation. I can say honestly that at that point, I had absolutely no trauma in my life. My parents did nothing but love and care for me. I just so happen to have a ""depressed"" brain...and the beginning of puberty allowed its awakening.

I was able to make it through high school because I went to a charter school specifically for kids with ""emotional disturbances"", but I only made it halfway through college before I had another full-fledged episode of depression and had to drop out (I was walking out of classes because I needed to cry for no reason).  I still lived at home, and about a year later my parents told me I need to work. The only job I could do, one that allowed me to come and go as I please, and take time off when I needed it, and still be able to support myself, was stripping. In the meantime I was violently raped by a ""friend"" of mine. I couldnt't deal with it, so I just went to work the next day like nothing happened, with a tampon up my ass so I wouldnt bleed everywhere. Supressed it as long as I could, until again I woke up and decided I wanted to die. Began therapy a few years later...last I saw he was happily married with children. My fucking rapist got the life I wanted and never had.....

While I was able to move out on my own thanks to dancing, after 7 years I was vomiting before shifts, And my boyfriend at the time had told me that he would never marry me as long as I was dancing. So, I decided I was mentally well enough to try school again, and graduated one year later with my certification in personal training. I spent a few years making minimum wage to build my experience, and finally I got a full-time gig with benefits. All the while noticing that my boyfriend still didnt seem into marrying me, it had been 6 years-he finally told me ""we are not financially stable yet"". Even tho he made over $100,000 a year...but alright.

Turns out, he was cheating on me with a goddamn stripclub bartender! I googled his email because I had forgotten his Amazon name, and ended up finding a whole bunch of shit that devastated me. His reaction was to first say "" I didnt think you'd ever find that"" (well, use a different handle than the one you always use next time), then to tell me that I needed to move out. Told him I didnt have the money to move out. He said he would pay for the deposit, but when I found a place-he couldnt produce it. Finally told me he didnt want me to leave after all,, we can work on this, blah. Until six months later, when he finally admitted-after 8 years-that he didnt want to marry me, ever. I just wasnt a good enough ""homemaker"". I finally asked for help from my one rich aunt, got the deposit, finally moved out..

While in the meantime, I had been promoted to head PT and trainer for new staff; despite the heartbreak at home, I actually had a job with a prestigous title (for me) and an actual, successful career. I was making enough to pay rent, and was on track for another raise...

Until 2 weeks later. When I was fired over the phone, because one front desk worker said she ""heard"" me jerking off a client on an recumbent bike. Seriously. Never in one million years would I have ever even thought of doing such a thing, but you know...she was 18 and her boyfriend enjoyed his workouts with me. That was enough for her to make sure I never worked there again...I was never accused once of jerking someone off when I was a goddam STRIPPER............

Of course with no job and no income, I was given one month's notice to move out. I found a cheap room, and was able to get some work at an old colleague's new gym. I didnt have a lot of hope for the future, but I still had a little.......

And then, I got Covid and almost died from it.

It's been six months and I'm still too weak to walk let alone train, too much brain fog to really do any sort of work, and only have two weeks of unemployment (that I had to fight for) left. I have no money and no job. No man has ever decided I was worthy enough of marriage or having a family with. My own body has become a shell of itself, and the hypoxia from Covid as well as the inflammation in my brain from it, has made my depression 1000x worse. I tell people I need help, physically and mentally, but all I have to do is say Trump could have handled this better-and they basically tell me I should kill myself because saying mean things about Trump hurts their feelings. Or, they're just so ""tired"" of the minimal restrictions that they freely admit, they just don't care about me or my health anymore. Because you know, people need indoor dining but they don't need me....

These are people who claim to love me, saying these things. This is my support system saying these things to me........

Can anyone here honestly say, if they were me, they would still have hope that ""things will get better""? I'm not doing another 40 years of this. And since Covid didn't kill me (though it came so close I was on oxygen for 6 days)-I'm nearing the point where I just have to do it myself.

I don’t even have the energy to pull out my laptop and watch Netflix now. My housemates don’t even notice when I don’t leave my room for a week.

I think acting depressed around people was a mistake,"No one gives a shit lmao. Unless you have a very special person who's very close to you, whoever notices you're acting off will not want to help, because you're not fun to be around, and in the end you'll just lose connections.

Truth is, you're way better off if you force a smile on your face. If I had known this before, I feel like I might have had more and better relations with people that I would have liked.

Don't get me wrong, I think its important for people to talk about their depression and be true to themselves. But it's just simply futile to mope around depressed around your peers since that's just gonna insure that no one's ever gonna talk to you, its a terrible alternative. So ""give in"" if you want to help yourself.

EDIT: okay, I was wrong. I really should not have gotten this many upvotes. I know no one is gonna see this since I'm editing after like a month, but I was wrong. 

Talking to people helps so, so much. Its just, you gotta find the right people, or you gotta build a friendship with someone to eventually be able to talk about your depression. Its true that forcing a smile on your face will probably help you to build these kind of friendships, and its true its not a good idea express your depression to randoms just like that.

 But I just want to say, don't bottle up your feelings forever. Do what you must to create friendships with people that enable you to do this. Often forcing a smile helps for this.

Six Years Ago Today I Tried to Kill Myself,"January 9, 2015 I tried to kill myself.  Today, I am in an even worse position than I was.  I'm now separated from my husband, caring for my son alone, a quarter of a million dollars in debt from school, living alone in a townhouse I can't afford, and having chronic health issues.  I don't want to die now, but God, I can't help but think how much better things would have been if I was successful 6 years ago.  My son wouldn't have to grow up in a broken home.  I wouldn't be crying every single day.  I wouldn't be trying to finish school when I can barely function.  My body wouldn't feel like it was shutting down.  There would be none of this suffering.  I guess what I'm saying is this living thing was only worth it because I got a child out of it.  I got to know the real love for my baby, and now I'll never ever kill myself because I have him and he will need me forever.  Which coincidentally means I have to suffer forever until I die naturally.  :( Sorry, just in my feelings today.  I want to celebrate my 6 more years of life, but I just can't.  There's nothing to celebrate about living a life like mine.  Maybe I don't think positively enough.

I feel like I’m getting “dumber” ?,"So I’ve been depressed for years. I’d consider myself a relatively smart guy, but recently I’ve noticed pretty heavy  brain fog, frequent headaches, and just my overall ability to think and process information impaired. I’m still able to memorize notes, and stay focused in class for the most part but I do notice a difference and my only guess is that years of depression and anxiety has finally caught up to me (cognitively)? I honestly had no idea that depression effected your critical thinking skills until recently. I don’t drink or do drugs, I’m pretty active, and I eat relatively clean. I don’t take any medication, although I have a bottle of SSRIS still sitting in my cabinet prescribed to me months ago. I’ve always tried fighting through this mentally, but should I take them? Would it alleviate my current cognitive disfunction?

2 years of trying to avoid accepting that I have depression and today I can’t stop crying because of one of the stupidest reasons. I am so tired.,"2 years of going through 2 breakups and multiple diagnoses of different diseases at a very early age and never did I feel any sadness or cried. I knew I was depressed and avoiding it. And today suddenly while getting out of car I dropped my key and it fell into a pothole and I can’t stop crying since then. 

Life has been shit and I’m so tired. I haven’t even read a book in months. I can’t study, can’t read, can’t even play video games with concentration anymore. I’m so tired and yet I have so many responsibilities.


Edit - Thank you to everyone who’s replying. I’m better now since the evening. I don’t know why but it was a sudden trigger. My car has been a way to just avoid any shitty situation. And losing the key was a very sudden trigger even though I knew I had another key. I get it’s a very weird thing to cry over but I just couldn’t stop. Thank you to all of you. The comments helped a lot.

High functioning depression is so hard for people to understand,"People are only just starting to understand depression but it's usually depression that's making you stay in bed all the time or not eat... 


I always feel like people think I'm lazy or I even question whether I have depression, I exercise regularly, go to uni, eat well, cook a lot of fresh meals for myself, socialise and work... But I had to cut my hours because I had a breakdown. I find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. I'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house. I have days where I'm like a zombie, everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day, I feel heavy and I kind of feel like I'm trying to run through deep water.

But nobody really expects this from a depressed person, it seems like I get through life just fine because I do get through life but it's actually much harder than it seems.

Edit: didn't expect this to get the amount of attention it has. I'm reading every comment and I'm trying to reply to all of them. Thank you for responding, feels good to know this isn't as uncommon as I thought, hope other people find comfort in that too.

Gaming won’t distract me forever,"Lately I’m gaming 6-10 hours out of the day just to distract myself from feeling empty. I guess it’s better than wallowing in my depression, but the minute I stop I’m back to suicide ideation.

I hate that nobody can understand what trauma does to you,"And this compounds the depression.

Not only is childhood trauma (one in which your parents - who *should* have represented all that was good - were in fact, evil) one of the worst possible causes of depression - but the fact that nobody gives two shits other than telling you ""get over it,"" or ""seek help."" 

As if trauma is expected, but not ignoring it is not expected. You're supposed to conform to this place; to accept trauma as normal, if not something you *do*, normally.

Why? I have no privacy in this house. When my brother was angry at me that same vacation, he kicked down my door and threw a pail of kitchen garbage all over my room. The ""lock"" on my door is easy to unlock, apparently my parents are able to open it easily and have been snooping into my room when I'm not there.

The day before yesterday, I had eaten more portions than normal and my dad yelled at me me; knocking over dishes and screaming that I ate so much. I locked myself in my room and didn't eat anything the whole day after that.

Today I wake up to my parents yelling my name and telling me to respond back. I see them somehow unlocking the door in their usual way; but the two deadbolts were there. That probably was a surprise to them.

I didn't want to get the police involved or buy myself a new door, so I opened the door and yelled at them for 10 seconds before closing the door. There were so many things left unsaid, I wanted to yell at them for more reasons.

I feel like I have to at least try to kill myself before anyone takes me seriously. (17f),"This is long and I feel like I’m attention seeking for even writing this, but it’s how I feel. I could never actually do anything, but I’m tired and don’t know what else to do.

Everyone in my life seems to think that just because they don’t see me crying 24/7, I’m not depressed. But when I do end up opening up and crying, they take it personally and blame themselves or me and make me feel so ungrateful that I feel horrible for even trying to express anything. In result, I usually try and suppress my emotions to keep from bothering anyone and especially prevent making my mom feel bad as she tries her best. 

Thankfully, somedays I’m numb and can’t feel anything at all. 

My mom who I love dearly, feels that because I don’t pay any bills and don’t go to work, there’s absolutely no reason why I should be depressed. Which makes sense I guess, but my brain apparently doesn’t agree lol. 

I zone out as an escape sometimes and end up in deeper trouble. I’m weeks behind on my schoolwork and have teachers calling me everyday, being patronizing and snippy about the missing work and I hate myself for it. I’m occupying valuable space in their class, and for what? I feel like I’ll never get caught up. I just want to be dead or at least in the hospital or something so that they’ll leave me alone, a thought that I’ll most likely never act on. Every time I look at my work, I get incredibly nervous and can’t think of anything else but failing and how angry they probably are with me. 

My mom is disappointed in me and no matter what I do or say, she doesn’t believe me and I end up giving up in the end because I feel like nothing. I look like a terrible student which is so different from my previous school years. I feel like I try so hard, but there’s no evidence to support it. I really wish I could do more, but I can’t, I try to force myself, but I can’t get much done and I don’t know why. I’m a terrible student, dumb, useless, and can’t complete work on time. I’ve had no motivation for my work or anything else (like washing my hair or getting out of bed) completely disgusting, I know. 

I also have no friends. Normally, people exaggerate and say they have “no friends,” but at least have one or two. I have none. No one to talk to or confide in. I’ve never fit in anywhere and have social anxiety. No one cares. No one’s ever cared.

I struggle completely alone and have for seven years. I’ve lost interest in everything I used to love, and it hurts so much. I think about killing myself almost everyday, but I’m a coward and would never do it. 

I’ve asked in the past about seeing a therapist (covid makes the process even harder), but felt so horrible even asking because my mom said ‘fine, but she’d have to pick up extra shifts to afford it’ and that she didn’t understand why I couldn’t just talk to her because we’re close instead of being ungrateful and wanting to rely on a stranger and meds to make me stable like someone with real issues. 

I know she was just frustrated, but it’s statements like those that make me wish depression was more common and visible like the flu or something, so that I wouldn’t have to explain or feel weird or bad about getting treatment. 

It won’t be until I finally do something actually harmful, physical, and visible (my current “self harm” which I don’t do often, isn’t) that I might get help. If I can even be helped. But I won’t and probably never will. 

I feel like nothing and a huge burden at the same time. A complete failure. And although I try to be as selfless as I can, I appear and feel like a selfish, ungrateful brat. I don’t have a bad life and my parents are great so why do I feel this way? There have been days where it felt like it could possibly get better, but I kid myself every time. Each year it somehow gets worst. I don’t really want to die, but hate my entire existence and want to get away. 

Also, I know this probably seems trivial and somewhat whiny. I’m sorry for bothering you all. I didn’t know where else to put this and it felt somewhat soothing to vent. Thank you if you decided to read this.


Edit: I’m typically a very private person so it took a lot to share this. Thank you all for being kind and giving me advice, I’m eternally grateful. I feel less alone now.

Anyone else's depression going into overdrive with the recent seasonal changes?,"I was doing great all summer. Wouldn't even say I was depressed just a few weeks ago. But with the clouds, coldness, late sunrises, and early sunsets, I can feel things starting to spiral. Particularly, I seem to have lost the ability to fall asleep at the right time or sleep through the night. My schedule is all shifted, and I'm basically just getting sleep in chunks at random times. My mood is reflecting my poor sleep.

I don't know if it's SAD or if the light changes are screwing with my circadian rhythm, but I don't like it.

I think depression for me tends to be a very physical affair. Body pain, muscle tension, sleep disturbances. It always seems like this stuff comes first. My mood issues are more insidious. I'm generally pretty rational and emotionally reserved, and don't tend to feel emotions super strongly in one way or another. So it sneaks up on me..a slow, creeping apathy and anhedonia. I tend to get pretty deep into it before I realize how bad things have gotten.

I just want to be passionate about something again,"It's been so fucking long. I try to find a hobby, a goal, a fucking anything, but I just can't. Best case scenario I put a lot of effort into it for a week or two before I finally give up faking it. I mean I literally force myself to do things hoping I'll grow passionate about them, or at least enjoy them enough to look forward to doing them.


But I can't, and I don't know how to make it better. 40 years old, my youngest kids are starting to get to the point where they don't need me as much anymore which is good for them. I fear the day tho when I don't even have them to give me some purpose. Living out the rest of my days as a functional vegetable. Pretty sure that's where I'm headed.

My dad is gone... forever,"This is so hard for me to talk about so I’m just gonna start. Sorry for the run on sentence and the mistakes. 


My dad died last week, on Friday actually. I have been trying to be so strong but it is so hard and I know he would be upset I’m needing this help but honestly I just need any supportive words. He was with his best friend and they got a call for a big contract (my dad and his roomate are electricians, my dad is 63 and retired but still helps his roomate our) my dad left the shop to go to the bank to pull out some money. He was 10 steps from the cross walk but he thought he could make it jay walking accross a 4 lane highway. The light was red and there was a big semi truck blocking the 2 lanes after the meridian. He tried to walk in between the semi and it’s trailer and the light turned green. I know all of you can imagine what happened next. I feel so fucked and so sad my dad has a good 15-20 years in him, he was healthy and happy. A little skinny from beer and coffee but he wasn’t no lazy old man. I have 3 brothers (27 year old,24 year old, 19 year old (me), and my little brother is 16.)
I just had a kid and I’m already so stressed about that cuz it was a little unexpected. And last my dad knew was it was going shitty and we were getting ready to go to court. I have been seeing him everyday since my son was born. I never even got a picture with my dad and my newly born son. Im also so worried about my mom because she gets like this over if she looses a pack of smokes. I don’t know how she is ever gonna be okay again. I don’t know if I’ll ever be okay. I just want to walk into my dads house hug him one more time laugh about anything. He always dropped whatever he was doing to help out family, no matter what. My mom and him were divorced for 20 years and when mental health kicked my moms butt and she couldn’t take care of my little brother and was about to go homeless my dad was there for her offering her his bed even after 20 years. I just keep rambling on because I really don’t even know how to end this I just don’t even know. I love you so much dad and I miss you. His favourite beer was Budweiser and I don’t drink beer so if anyone could pop a bud for my dad. Thank you. He also loved to fish. He was most happiest sitting on the lake with his boys fishing all day. I love my dad so much he was an asshole sometimes but that’s cuz he wanted what’s best for us and what dad isn’t an asshole sometimes. He never beat me or made me feel embarrassed he was always there. My youngest brother was even only my half brother but my dad called him his son, and my brother called him dad. I know my dad wasn’t a dumbass I fucking know that to the absolute top of anything. He just made a dumb idea. Must have been feeling 19 again. I love you so much dad. I’m gonna try everyday to be okay for you and to make sure mom will be okay. I’m gonna be the best dad just like you were to me. ❤️❤️❤️❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/ibn6rc/my_dad_is_gone_forever/,depression

I told him “no” and he got pissed.,"My uncle asked me to take him a couple places today and I told him no, I can’t take you right now. 

He knocked on my door at around 6 in the morning to ask me to take him out. 6 in the morning. Im fucking half naked inching the door open while this man asks me at 6 in the morning if I can take him out to a couple places today.

I said no. I’m in the middle of finals. I know a couple places means “5 places that I’ll spend an hour each in”. 

I said no and he said alright. I thought that was the end of it. I get back in bed. An hour later he’s slamming shit in the kitchen, slamming doors closed downstairs, till finally, he comes up to me again, pounding on the door, asking me to take him somewhere. I said no and he started fucking screaming. 

Over the word no.

He eventually said nevermind and a second later he’s walking out the door slamming the door on his way out.

Over the word no.

But when I tell my parents this, *im* the wrong one for getting *him* upset and not succumbing to what *he* wants. 

My dad asked me the other day if I still had my “depression”

What the fuck does he think?

Edit: thank you for all the solidarity. I oftentimes feel like I’m an asshole and run myself into circles wondering what I did wrong in each and every moment, how I could have prevented a negative confrontation from my family by simply being agreeable with them. I struggle with this and the friends I have don’t always fully understand where I’m coming from all of the time so it’s nice seeing that I’m not insane over denying someone else. I managed to get a go ahead from a friend to stay at his place for the weekend to cool off because I’m starting to spiral and am quickly heading to a place I don’t want to be.

I have rejected many good jobs because it gives me social anxiety. I am highly sensitive and many of my previous jobs gave me depression as I was often “too quiet” or just did not fit in with the rest.

I have lost my empathy.,"Before my depression, there was warmth and curiosity in my personality. When people I cared about told me their stories I listened and felt happy for them. When I saw a family member struggling I would feel compassion for them and I would do what I could to help them. 


I seem to have lost this. When someone tells me about themselves or their experiences, I don't care unless it affects me. Their stories are boring to listen to, even the closest life events. Engagements, marriages, accidents, ilness, none of it interests me. I feel extremely guilty over this and it's a big part of my illness. When I speak to someone, I feel intense anxiety and a bit of fear. It feels like the person speaking to me will get upset because I'm not enthustiastic or engaged in the conversation - as if they'll think I don't enjoy spending time with them and thus stop spending time with me. I'm afraid of losing them and being alone.


It's true, though - I don't enjoy spending time with them, which is part of why I feel so horrible in the first place. 
  

I know that the problem is me, not them. My friends and family are fantastic people and we've been very close in the past but when I think about my memories with them I feel nothing.

A burden.,"No one wants to spend time with a negative person, no one makes time for someone who is having a hard time. No one wants to hear bad things, complains, issues that others are struggling with. None of this is fun, so no one truly cares, no one puts the effort into a relationship whether is a friendship or more.
Most people are selfish and that's ok. People don't own people. Everyone deals with things and that's ok.

So I'm giving up asking for help, I don't want to bother anyone anymore. I don't want to upset others, waste their time...
I'm just a nobody, a burden who doesn't deserve anything!

Night is the worst. It's dark, silent, empty and I normally cry to sleep. It's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard.

I almost killed myself tonight,"I know nobody will read this...

I was staring at a glass of water mixed with a drug that in that dose has a near 100% chance of killing me. Stared at it for about an hour and even raised the glass up to my lips. But I never drank it. Something stopped me and I'm not sure what. 

But nothing's changed. I still want to die and everything is still shitty.

The only person I ever loved and cared about stopped being my friend when I opened up about my mental health. Just completely abandoned me. Everything else in my life has been shitty but that has really been a kick in the guts. I keep reaching out, hoping she'll reply to me and be friendly one day. But on the rare occasion she replies it's ""I don't want to deal with you"", ""find someone else"", etc. I fucking have nobody else. Everything I've tried has failed. Getting nowhere I'm therapy.

life is a chore,"Having to wake up and immediately being struck with this shock of *I have to do this all over again.* Have to go to school, college, university or even work, we're stuck in our imaginative sociable, unsociable life.

Just imagine yourself not fitting into those sets of species. We all supposedly ""have a purpose"" to fill, but what if you don't fit that category? Where do we go from there?

In my situation, I personally think I am not fit for this world. I suffer with a major physical health issue and that constantly affects my mental health.

"Slowly, I didn't realize I was already killing myself","First I killed the athlete. There wasn't much of him to begin with so it was easy. At the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.

Next I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.

Next I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.

Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. 

I'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left.

I'm actually surprised to realize that I've been hurting myself without physically doing so. I've lost more of myself in the past few months than I ever had in years. And I'm not making any more of me than what I already have.


PS. I wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. And putting what I've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain ""myself"" throughout the past year. I still get spans of time where I feel like nothing, where I feel afraid of being nothing that I'd rather just lose my life.

Depression steals your youth away,I remember when I was 15 and my depression started that was 1995 I hated school with a passion that was the first year I ever was on a antidepressant aka Prozac which didn't help at all. By the year 2000 I was finishing High School I was going on 6 years of depression at that point and I already had a overdose suicide attempt a year prior. Now I'm 40 years old and it has been 26 years of depression I never accomplished anything in my life never even had a gf a complete absolute loser and now on top of that I have permanent neurological health problems that makes my life even worst it's not from my suicide attempt but something not related. I guess my point is depression made me lazy and a miserable bastard that never connected with the outside world it stoled my youth away something I can never have back. Living with regrets is just as bad as depression don't be me there is no recovering from lost time and permanent health issues plus clinical depression it's a living hell. All I can say is if you're still young and at least have your physical health you need to go and try your hardest to at least try to find happiness while you can.

Do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from?

"Turned my life around, depression didn't go away. What's the fucking point then?","After 10 years of feeling miserable, and struggling to overcome and move on from all the failure in my life, I eventually got to the point where, objectively speaking, my life was in a good spot.

At 29 I finally graduated from the degree I'd started at 18, I somehow got lucky enough to land a really good job. I'd started exercising more and going to the gym. I'd always struggled with feelings of extreme loneliness, but now I was dating a girl who obviously loved me.

Throughout my 20s I thought if I pushed hard enough and persevered, I could eventually be happy.

But good old me, I'm still miserable. The success I've finally found doesn't make me feel anything. I still feel like an empty shell. My brain just doesn't register any positive emotions, only negative ones. I have zero motivation to live when there is no emotional reward for good experiences.

 I broke up with the girl I was dating, because even though I cared about her, and on some level I knew it was good to have someone in my life who cared about me, I seemed unable to experience feelings of being in love. It was eating me up inside knowing that I couldn't reciprocate the love she felt for me. 

I feel cheated for having spent so much time trying to turn my life around, only for it to have made no difference. I'm so tired. I'm tired of therapy and trying to get help.

I graduated high school in 2012 and since then i have isolated myself rarely leaving my house. I'm posting this hoping someone will listen and maybe give advice.

I was raised by my grandparents and growing up they were controlling and overprotective. I did not get to do things most other kids were doing. I just stayed home all the time and played video games or watched tv. When i was in school i had no friends and rarely talked. I was not bullied but most of my classmates would not talk to me.  My teachers said i had a learning disability so thought out school i had extra help with my classes.. My grandfather died in 2007, After high school i isolated myself.  I have had opportunities to get jobs but i was scared to talk to strangers. The time has passed by so fast and i  cant believe i let this happened.

I Feel like there is no hope for things to change. Who would hire someone like me. I made bad grades in school and too poor to go to a community college.  I also would like a girlfriend but I'm short and too shy.  I'm very depressed and thinking about ending my life.

Mom said I’m free to commit suic*de if I finished my study.,"I’ve been suffering from depression for more than 15 years and recently for many reasons it gets worse. In the year of 2017 my parents asked me to get a masters degree since my previous education was too bad, I successfully got enrolled but due to my mental health condition and my social phobia I feel it’s really hard for me to keep going, especially when I compare myself to other rich and happy schoolmates, I feel no motivation and no willing to focus on my study, I like it but it’s all because of my family wanted it, not me. I then realized that I haven’t done anything for my own good, I just fulfill other people’s wish all the time, this realization makes me frustrated and feeling hopeless and meaningless. So I’m being suicidal for some months. I talked to my mom last month, I said if I could quit, because I want to restart my own life and try to enjoy. I know I mess up my 31 year long life already since I don’t have a goal I am just being alive as my parents’ best obedient kid, I see no future, no meaning in my life so I want to give up, I feel so excited when thinking about death, a relief and a method to solve all the pains. 
I talked about these feelings with my mom and dad I hope they can be understanding and supportive but they said no, I can’t quit before I finish my school, also they said if I want to die, it’s better to finish my school first then I can die with a certificate, that at least makes them feel good that I did a thing.  

I really want to die as a revenge to them, they don’t care about me and my problem, they said if I die it’ll be a huge loss and shame for them, because their peers would really look down to them.

Just thought it was unnecessary escalation. They offered to take me to hospital. My depressive episodes are sporadic enough that I can be lucid about them after but while I'm in them my mind is v numb and all I can think of is 'why am I here', and I can't answer.

My brother plans to kill himself on 7/2,"Hi everyone,

I'm 24 y/o female, my brother is a 19 y/o. Mid May, my brother was taken to the hospital for attempting suicide. His online friends called his college to request a wellness check and got the cops involved. They found him unconscious in his dorm room. 

We have a very toxic mom. To give you some context, my mom told him ""Do it right the next time so we don't have to drive 8 hours to pick you up."" She loves us but she's very immature, toxic, physically abusive, mentally abusive, etc. She's sort of a horrible human being but in her mind, she has done all she can for us. She had me when she was 19, single mom, we don't talk to our dad. 

He's set on doing it again because my brother and I have an extremely close relationship and he doesn't want to be a burden on me. He has been failing school, hates my mom, and feels like if he kills himself, my life will become better because my mom will realize she is the problem. But my mom will never know that. He thinks I'll be sad for a couple of years but I'll get through it because I'm a strong person. He has told my boyfriend that he has bought 100 pills this time for his second attempt. 

My brother is the best. But my mom has fucked him up so much. He feels like he doesn't deserve my love and feels extremely guilty that I'll have to take care of him when I went through so much to get where I am. I just graduated with a masters degree and looking for a job on the west coast.

I also want to note there is a genetic component. On my mom's side, my grandpa, my uncle have killed themselves. My mom has attempted suicide when I was in high school by jumping off our apartment but survived. I have been depressed since age 7 but became healthy two years ago. My brother has felt this way since he was 10. I told him once I get a job I can take him away forever and help him get his life back on track but he doesn't want to burden me. 

What do I do? Has anyone been in a situation like this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/h88bej/my_brother_plans_to_kill_himself_on_72/,depression

I simply want to die,"No biggie. I’m not depressed, I like my life, I love my family, I have everything going well. Just starting my professional career, I make more money than most people my age, I’m in a relationship, I’m an attractive young woman and that’s it. But I still want to die.
I’m not depressed, I know a lot of people would miss me and I would destroy my parents if I actually tried to do anything. But none of this truly matters sometimes. I feel empty in a way I can’t put into words and I’m just looking for someone who can relate to this - lack of - feeling. I don’t want to actually pursue a career, I don’t feel motivated to do anything, I don’t see myself working as a teacher and actually being happy, but I also don’t see myself working with anything and being happy.
I just want it to stop. I don’t want to exist, to have to follow social rules, to be human. Sometimes I just feel like every action I make is forged and I’m just waking up everyday, putting on a mask or something and pretending I care about the world. I don’t. I think humans are as insignificant as ants, and that’s actually a beautiful thing. We’re bound to fulfill our duties, keep the engine working and then die.
I wish I could just unplug without hurting anyone, just vanish as if I’d never existed.
No one knows about how I feel, ‘cause I’m the only person who truly knows myself. I get everything done, but everything makes me exhausted. It’s like other people have it all figured out and I’m the only one who can’t bare having to do the simplest of tasks.

I regret not committing suicide when I was younger,"As a teenager I thought about it a lot.
Came close once or twice.
But I chickened out.

Now I regret it so much. If I had done it then, only my family would have been affected. And it’s partially their fault so maybe it would have served as a teachable moment for them.

Now, I have friends and a partner that would be absolutely destroyed if I did it. They don’t deserve it.

I wish I had done it when I still had so few attachments, when there was so little harm to be done.

Now I am condemned to exist to avoid hurting those I love.
Fuck.

my pain (25F) is overwhelming: i've been quarantining in an abusive household for the last year and am in need of some kind words,"i've been struggling a lot this week. my mental health has always been shit but lately, it's just gotten worse. i recently fired my therapist because my insurance changed and she wasn't accepting the new provider (she wasn't a good fit for me either, but something is better than nothing). so aside from my boyfriend and a few friends, i don't have anyone i can rely on. i feel bad venting to the people around me because they're all going through tough times too and it just doesn't feel fair for me to unload on them. so i hope that opening up to this sub is the right idea, even though i still feel guilty expressing my pain.

the heart of it all is that i have C-PTSD (along with other psych disorders) and these past few weeks I've been drifting in and out of disassociation, flashbacks, and episodes of crying fits. i can't stop reliving my trauma and am having a tough time with positive self-talk. right now i'd say my self-worth and self-esteem are at a 0. it doesn't help that i live in an abusive household but unfortunately i don't have anywhere else to go, and this is something I've dealt with my whole life. my mother is neglectful and my father is emotionally, verbally, and sometimes physically abusive. he picked a fight with me this morning for no reason and it set me over the edge. so between the flashbacks, disassociation, and deeply painful depression, i just feel so unsafe in my house. if my parents see me crying, they'll either gaslight or bully me. i just wish things were different. i don't really know where i'm going with this post other than it would be nice to be reminded that not everyone is mean and nasty. that i am a good person and i deserve a good life. i just want to stop crying.

There is no way they will feel as terrible as I do everyday, at least have the ability to get over it whereas I am condemned to this suffering until I die some other way. I think about how my girlfriend will feel if she finds out I've killed myself and I just do not care, I love more than anything, even more than myself, but I want death so badly that there is nothing that convince not to do it now. My mum, dad, brother, grandad, grandma and literally everybody in my family will be devastated beyond words, and I am fine with that. Because I will have victory for once, I will fixed it at the greatest possible cost and I'm glad. Their sadness is of no concern of mine when im fucking dead. 

I do not enjoy living, as I have stated in other posts. I dont care about the little things in life. The smell of freshly cut grass isnt a valid reason to fucking live, you jackass. I may laugh at things that are funny, and may enjoy making others laugh, and enjoy the company and love of my girlfriend, but it just isnt enough. I need some other way of relief of my problems if not suicide, I am not fucking willing to put in any hard work, because I could just kill myself lol. I need a giant stroke of luck, or a huge incredibly forgiving second chance that will just make everything go away. I wish all my problems could just be fixed by some miracle solution, and they all say it's just hard work that will fix it. 

But no pal, it's suicide and it's a legitimate solution. It ends my problems and that's all I want. I'm quite frankly sur people arent just okay with people suicide, and that it doesnt happen even more than it does. It's just such an absolute and perfect solution for everything, the only reason people stop is because they feel obligated to others, but I just dont have that filter. I feel oddly free in the solace that suicide gives me, whenever a new problem arises it doesnt affect me anymore because I know that one day I wont have to deal with this shit because I'll be dead and buried.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/lazmim/i_need_at_least_one_person_to_see_this_i_have_0/,depression

Goodbye.,"I just finished writing my final goodbye letters to my mom, dad, and brother. Goodbye. I want to talk to someone but I don’t know who. I’m planning on overdosing on lean or some other drug. I know that my parents will just say that depression and suicidal thoughts are just common and focus on my grade and GPA. I feel hopeless. I want to know where to take my  life from. No comfort or support will help me much. I feel like I’m better off gone than having to work more and study and prepare for school and the SAT. To me that is all there is to life. I’m sorry mom and dad. Even though I spent time with you I simply can’t get over it. Goodbye and I love you because this is not your fault. Thank you for all the memories and support you have me for the past seventeen years of my life. The times when you scolded me that if I didn’t get a good SAT score, then I would be sent to academies and my dog would be sent back to its previous home.

How do people just accept working 40+ hours a week for the rest of their lives?,"I know this is just how society works--we have to work in order to benefit from the work of others...the exchange of labor. It seems like most people have just accepted this as reality. They get their work done and then enjoy the rest of their time and the things they get to do with the money they've earned working. But I can't seem to do that.

The idea of spending more than half my waking hours 5 days a week doing something I don't want to do and find stressful for someone else makes me feel so incredibly hopeless. It's only Saturday, and I'm already dreading entering a whole new workweek. This feeling gets much worse on Sundays. And then during the week, I come home from work and know I have to go back in a matter of hours, and the thought makes me miserable and basically ruins the time I don't have to be working. 

I feel like I spend 5 of my 7 days a week just wishing they were over. That's depressing to me.

How the fuck do people find things they actually like and stick with it??,"One of the big pieces of advice I see for depressed people online is to ""find a hobby"" or find something fulfilling. I can see how this would be a great piece of advice, if it actually worked for me. 

Any time I pick something new up, I kind of enjoy it, keep doing it for a few weeks (maybe even a month if I'm lucky), get bored and then stop. Rinse and repeat, every goddamn time. I've tried the gym, running, tennis, football, photography, hell even playing video games I get bored of eventually. 

Maybe it's because of my depression, but I really struggle to find something I actually enjoy to the point of wanting to do it as much as possible over a long period of time. Most things that I find which I genuinely enjoy, my enjoyment/determination fizzles out after a few weeks to the point where my effort put in outweighs my enjoyment so I just stop. How do people find things they enjoy and actually want to stick with it for a long period of time??

"Went for 2 AM walk in the rain, finally felt alive and free.","After 3/4 of a bottle of pinot grigio I decided to take my one woman pity party outside. I let the rain fall on my face. I let it soak my sweater. I walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me. I stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face. I held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body. I waked through the park. I got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as I could, like when I was a kid. I spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks. I fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around.

And I know I will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. But I really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys.

43 and completely lost,"I've never posted anything online before so I'll try to be succinct.  I'm 43 male, never married, no kids, on medical leave from my job for depression.  I'm so disappointed in the person I've become.  No matter how much I read or do, it's like I have not gained any wisdom on managing life's challenges.  I grew up in a loving home with lots of encouragement and high expectations.  I was an A student through college but my social skills have always been lacking.  I managed to work for the past 20 years, but I couldn't keep up in my current job, hence the medical leave.   

I've been in therapy for much of the past 10 years.  My psychologist believes I have traits of avoidant personality disorder.  I take several antidepressants and I'm currently two weeks into TMS therapy.  Nothing seems to help.  I'm unbelievably critical of myself.  Even now, as I write this message, I am certain that this will be the worst written message ever on Reddit.   I've been reading hundreds of other posts and they seem so well written.  I'm even more amazed by the responses.  How are you all able to find the words to share your wisdom and advice?  I read everything I can find on overcoming depression and avoiding suicide but it goes right through me and outv the other end with nothing retained.  I can't imagine giving advice to someone.  There is so little I can think of to say to people in distress.  

I'm a mess right now.  I have lost hope of getting better.  I don't exercise, I sleep 14 hours a day.  I have a house but I spend most nights at my parents.  Nothing traumatic has ever really happened to me.  The worst thing is that my ex-girlfriend cheated on me three years ago and I haven't dated since.  I have some solid friends that I've known since high school.  They are all very well adjusted and have careers and families of their own. 
I can't seem to learn anything these days.  I used to be smart but I am not longer able to learn new things.   I can't imagine surviving another 40 years.  I think about volunteering but I even tell myself that I have nothing valuable to offer.  I've no real skills to rely on.  I have saved about $300K in my 20 years of work. I had saved that money so that I could support having a family some day.  I no longer think I'm capable of having a family.  Too overwhelming.  I would be an awful spouse and father.
I don't plan to go back to work.  I plan to just live on my savings as long as I can and then end my life.  By then my parents will be gone and I won't hurt them.  My siblings and friends will be hurt in the near-term but they will be ok in the long run.  

I've read so much on coping with this disease.  But so little spurs me to action.  Until last year, I'm was microdosing with weed every morning to get myself going, keeping up with job and social occasions.  The weed stopped working for me though.  Now if I smoke, it gives me some paranoia that makes things worse.

I’m kinda disgusted with myself,"I have a depression nest. My bedroom is disgusting. I have a path from my door to my bed and that’s just about it. Everywhere else I have piles of clothes and old food containers and boxes and crap I don’t need. I have a hoarding problem on top of being too depressed to clean; my dad is a pack rat too so I’ve always spent my life in clutter. I don’t think it’s at TV show level but it’s still bad. Does anyone have tips/advice for finally cleaning up? I’ve been trying but honestly some days I pick up like 2 pieces of trash and toss a couple things in a laundry basket and I automatically feel drained.


I remember when my old roommate barged in to my room mistaking “I’m coming!” For “come in” I was always so careful about keeping roommates out of my room, always locking the door, because I was never more embarrassed. I saw the shock on her face as I rambled off reasons for the mess “I just dumped everything in here when I moved in, I’ve just been super busy with school and work has me exhausted” I know she didn’t buy it she must have thought I was the nastiest person alive, she asked if I wanted help but I declined and said I’d handle it. I never really did.


I can handle living in clutter. It’s all I’ve ever really known. I do wish I had a super cute and organized room but on the rare occasion I do try to organize everything it never lasts. But I feel so guilty. Guilty because I have a dog. He’s been my best bud for the last 15 years or so and he doesn’t deserve this life. Like I said we’ve always lived in a cluttered house but my room is the absolute worse. He gets fresh food and water and I try to take him outside often so there’s no accidents in here and he gets fresh air but he still does not deserve this. I know he walks around my piles of crap just fine and still runs full speed to see me when I walk through the door, his tail wagging so fast that his whole little body wiggles. I know he loves me and I love him with my entire heart. He’s one of the only things that keep me going because I’m afraid of what would happen to him if I were gone. I don’t think my family would be the best caretakers and I saw how the poor guy grieved when my mom died. I saw how he was confused and still went to her bedroom looking for her every single day for the longest time. When we’d pull up in the car he’d race to the passenger door and wait for her to come out. My family showed me how he kept finding his way into my room when I first left for college. I wouldn’t want to leave him hurt and confused like that so I keep pushing on. But I can’t let him keep living like this. 


I’m disgusted and deeply disappointed in myself but I’ll do my best to clean my room and throw some stuff away. It definitely will not be anywhere close to easy but I still want to try.

The cancer has spread to my liver,"Well it's most likely the cancer, anyways. The doctors like to make me feel better by saying there's a chance it'll be benign, but so far it never has been. Every test has come back as bad news, which just leads to more tests and more uncertainty. The pain in my hips has come back, and knowing I have a fresh mass in my liver that's already 5cm across....it freaks me out. It wasn't there when I had surgery in the beginning of may, which means it's spreading, and fast. I was feeling ok for a couple weeks, but the pain is coming back and I'm scared for the abdominal pain to come back...that was the worst. The hurt in my hip is like a constant dull ache that's always bothering me, but the pain in my abdomen was like always feeling like puking but never actually puking, along with stabbing pain if I moved wrong. I don't want that again. I even talked to my doctor about going back to work and she said go for it if I feel okay, but what if I don't actually feel okay? What if it just keeps getting worse? Will I ever be back to normal? Will I be able to go back to school in the fall? Will I be able to finish my degree or will the cancer completely derail the one goal I had finally started to crawl towards? I have a biopsy scheduled in 2 weeks and I'm scared for that; my first biopsy didn't give conclusive results that lead to 4 months of waiting for surgery bc no one thought it was serious. Im terrified of that happening again.

Im just so full of uncertainty and I'm scared and I feel like im not valid for feeling any of it. People have it worse than I do, so my brain tells me I don't get to be upset. But I am. But I don't want to be. I'm conflicted. I'm upset. I want to sleep so I don't have to feel.

Forgive the rant, but thank you if you read through my woes anyways.

Edit: I posted this without much thought last night in the middle of a break down and went right to sleep afterwards. I can't believe the amount of support people have shown me...im in shock.

Aging is fucked,"I genuinely don’t want to be an older age. The idea of saying 26 or 27 when someone asks how old I am sounds fucking horrible to me. I’m just about coping with the fact that I’m 25 now.

Not because going into your late 20s is an objectively bad experience. Its more so because of  how society (especially the college age and below) vilify and basically makes fun of being around those ages.

It’s the “your pushing 30 and you’re still doing this or that” that I constantly see. It’s the whole age gap conversation that I feel like I see every other day on social media. The idea that I’ll soon be seen as a “creep” for being attracted to a 20 y/o is so deeply depressing to me. Especially cause I feel like I was just 19/20/21 myself and I blew that whole period of my life living like a hermit, just letting the weeks, months and birthdays just come and go.

I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway!

I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free!

I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!

I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)

Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)

The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)

This is more progress I’ve done in a friday-Sunday trip then I’ve done in 3 years sitting on my room and only operating in my small city.

I’m so proud of myself!

Feels lonely tho so I kinda wanna cry, I’m imaging how awesome this trip would’ve been (even more awesome) if I had a friend or ultimately a boyfriend with me! (I’m gay)

I’m so proud of myself. I wanna cry right now cause I’m going home tomorrow,I thought I would never say this, but I can’t wait to travel again! Preferably with someone this time!

I know this sounds cringe and I can’t believe Ive done this. I’m so confused why I don’t have panic attacks and stuff! But if I can do it, you can do it too. It really isn’t that scary, when u have small “missions” all the time to think about. I gotta go to x to eat and I gotta go see y and I gotta go check what train I’m taking for tomorrow, etc. these small missions keeping me  busy.

I know that when I get home tomorrow, it’s back to normal and misery waiting for me. But this was, I gonna say it SUPER FUN! I haven’t had this much fun in sooo many years!

I feel alive.

So I bought myself flowers today.,"No special occasion. I just had a tough day at work so I picked up a big bunch of tulips on the way home. Not the cheap ones either, but the lovely fresh perfectly blooming crisp and colorful kind. ""What's the big deal?"" you're probably thinking. The big deal is that there was a time in the not so distant past that the thought of ""treating myself"" to anything ""just because"" filled me with guilt, shame and self loathing. You don't deserve it. It's too good for you. You're not worth the time/effort/money. You are nothing and you have nothing to offer so you deserve nothing in return. 


So now I really appreciate any small act of kindness I afford myself. Yes, there are still days that I force myself to have a cold shower in the morning just because I hate it. I love cooking delicious food for other people, but I still sometimes eat instant noodles when I'm alone and having a bad day because it's a waste of time to cook just for me. But today I showed myself a little kindness. I acknowledged the fact that I work damn hard and I am great at my job. I have value and I am valued. Tulips are beautiful and so am I. I deserve to have beautiful things in my life because I am a badass bitch.


EDIT: Wow :) Thank you everybody. Honestly I didn't expect much of a response to this, I was just giving myself a little pat on the back for not being a dick to myself for once lol. I'm so happy it put a little smile on a few faces and even happier if it reminded even one of you wonderful people to be a little kinder to yourself. You're all awesome!!! And to the lovely stranger who gave me gold, thank you from the bottom of my heart for that. It was a nice surprise to wake up to this morning and put a little pep in my step today :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/bxktkp/so_i_bought_myself_flowers_today/,depression
"Life in this society is such a catch 22. People are always saying ""reach out, if you ever need me"" but actually don't want to be near anyone depressed.

Many pandemic-depressives didn't have empathy for mental health sufferers until it affected them.,"Once the pandemic is over, they'll recover and resume their lives forgetting their empathy for others. 

I've been depressed from childhood  and no one cared. Imagine going through racism, bullying, social exclusion and loneliness from 5 years old to adulthood.

I've put in tremendous efforts in improving myself and meeting people through various ways, yet, I get turned down because of my appearance (race and being not conventionally attractive etc.) or my quiet/ introverted personality and therefore, written off as ""weird"". How wonderful it would be to have friends that genuinely care.

Some of these people posting on social media about caring for others and reaching out are doing it just for the likes and popularity. So many of these phonies are the same assholes that would not give me/ people like me the time of day despite  ""reaching out"" to them. 

They're nothing but insincere and hypocrites that have in the past, contributed to the loneliness and mental health issues of others.

i honestly can't tell if i'm depressed or lazy as shit,"hi everyone, using a throwaway to avoid identification.

as i (19F) write this, i'm on the verge of tears and have a lump in my throat for no discernible reason. before this, i spent the whole day lying in the same spot watching tv, save for the one time i got up to make myself instant noodles. at dinner, i started tearing up because i was disappointed with the food (this is kinda embarrassing). my mum keeps asking me why i'm always lying down (not in a malicious way or anything) and i can't really pinpoint the reason but i'm always unexplainably exhausted. the good days are fine and sometimes really good, but the bad days (like today) just really suck. i feel like i am suspended in time and everything is in slow motion. i have wasted yet another day.

for some context, i'm in a transitional period in my life (graduated from high school, waiting to start college in october). i've had some moments of euphoria here and there that made me feel at the top of the world (got accepted to some really good schools etc.). however, for the most part, nothing really excites me. this is a real low compared to my last 2 years of high school (consistent high achiever, top student for a bunch of subjects, you get the gist) during which i felt some degree of fulfilment because i kept getting told i was good at things. i notice that, when i'm not occupied by the hustle and bustle of school, i always get like this more intensely than otherwise (like during summer vacations).

another thing- every single friend of mine has been motivated enough to get a job and do stuff that excites them. i've barely done anything. the only 2 things i managed to bring myself to do in the last 3 months were the result of me being talked into them by various people. i am a major pushover so obviously i ended up doing them. i just cannot bring myself to apply for a part time job because everyday i just go ""i am tired and i'll do it another day"". i feel like shit because i don't know if i have a problem or if my problem is just that i'm lazy.

my head is really heavy as i write this, so i apologize for my stream-of-consciousness writing style. the reason why i'm so confused is that, when i am in social settings, i'm really lively and fun. i'm also a very typical ""gifted"" kid / overachiever  with much less to worry about that my friends who are on the edges of their seats trying to figure out what to do in the future and shit. i have a loving family and supportive friends. i am grateful for everything i have, but i just get extremely blue and temperamental for no reason sometimes. i don't dare to discuss this with anyone i know because nobody would expect this from me. 

i don't know if this information helps but i typically feel like this during long holidays. basically, if people arent giving me responsibilities, i can't bring myself to do anything.

i'm so sorry i don't have the ability to organise this coherently right now, but could anyone share what depression can feel like? or at least give me a reality check if i really am just lazy and melodramatic? some clarity would be amazing. please be as candid as possible because if it really just is an attitude problem, at least i can stop being self-pitying and start doing something about it. 

just a disclaimer: i have never seriously considered suicide but from time to time i wonder what it would be like to just disappear. don't worry about me being a danger to myself because i would never do it.

that was a really long post. if you read to the end, thank you :)

Annus Horribilus,"Today is the anniversary of my daughter's death. She died in my arms, and I am grateful I could be with her. She was 25, and we were very close; cut from the same cloth.
She had long suffered depression and social anxiety which manifested in anorexia and alcoholism, creating 'the perfect storm' that resulted in her death. She made no secret of her desire to die, but her death wasn't suicide, per se.
In the year prior to her passing I was diagnosed with esophegal cancer, and spent a lot of time in hospital getting treatment. Nobody expected me to live, and I think this hit my daughter especially hard as she was very emotionally dependent on me.
During my time in hospital my ex wife, my daughter's mother, came to stay with my daughter to care for her. I've since discovered, from reading my daughter's reddit, emails and texts, that her mother was drink and abusive the whole time.
I demanded to be released from hospital early, as my daughter's health had deteriorated, and they made arrangements to get me home. I was unable to speak in more than a whisper, had no esophegas and was fed through a tube in my stomach but I was happy to be home with my daughter. We spent quality time together.
When she died a few weeks later I arranged the funeral and the wake. I couldn't deliver a eulogy, or even toast her life.
My daughter had very few friends, partly because of her treatment resistant depression, and partly because she just didn't suffer fools lightly. But the friends she did have she treated like gold. One was hospitalised after a failed suicide attempt, and my daughter drove 400 kms to visit him, and she went back every day for days on end, just as example. None of them could manage to get to her funeral.
I have recovered, mostly, now. But I don't know why. I don't want to live. Especially after this past year.
I am posting this not out of self pity but as a belated eulogy to my very, very special daughter. Without her the world is black and white and devoid of happiness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/g41t6v/annus_horribilus/,depression

my genitalia are destroyed after being raped and being prescribed lexapro. i don’t want to live anymore,"being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia, and it’s ruining my state of mind. please help

hey yall. not sure how to start this so i think i’ll just get into it. at 12/13 years old, i (f19) started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school. i started therapy, and then lexapro at 17. my anxiety decreased, but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness. i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression, so i took the pill regularly and properly. 

when i was 18, i was unfortunately raped several times by my long-term boyfriend, who i considered to be the love of my life. what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed, now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly, incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life. 

not long after that, i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls, or an extreme form of vaginismus. ive always been incredibly ‘tight’ for a lack of better words, not able to fit a tampon, usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried. i’m not able to have proper sex because of it. the only time i’ve been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me, and that was the worst pain of my life, physically and emotionally. 


i’m now 19, and i’m in a happy committed relationship. i love him deeply, and he’s a great partner. however, i find myself so depressed that i can’t provide for him sexually. not only for his sake, but for mine. my entire genital region is broken, and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it. i understand that a working vagina (or any vagina for that matter) is not what makes a woman, but it’s the only way i can describe it since there’s no proper term for female emasculation. 


ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago, and im very anxious to not see any improvement. i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms. 


i understand that it can take up to three months, but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat.


i can’t keep doing this anymore. i hate myself and body, and suicide is constantly on my mind. if anyone has dealt with this or something similar, i’d love to hear your advice. thank you :)

Therapy just made me more aware of how isolated I feel because most people suck at empathy,"I’ve been in therapy for years. In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.

Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me

Quiet quitting life,"I am quiet quitting life and nobody realizes that’s what it is. My friends think I’m just being a bad friend. My family just thinks I’m being a bad family member.

I don’t want to hang out and be made to feel obligated to stay until 11 pm before I can go home.  Nobody realizes that this is my way letting go of life, of escaping from the world.  I’m alone, I’m 30 years old and haven’t had an intimate partner for a decade. I love those in my life tremendously. But I just want to let go. When I’m home, I’m free to be who I want.

Being passively s**cidal is exhausting.,"I have gone through the same stages so many times I am beyond exhausted. I feel passively suicidal and wish that someone would shoot me or I'd die in an accident or something. Being beset by these thoughts exhausts me to the point I feel numb and I dissociate from myself and whatever is happening around me. I fall into a state of being unproductive and become listless. At this point everything is a chore including basic things like brushing my teeth, doing my laundry, or going to the grocery. I have to then put all of these tasks on my habit tracker to create an incentive to do all of these things, and manufacture motivation by seeing the ""streak"" that I have maintained. I somehow then muster the energy over the span of weeks to reach a functional state where I am fairly productive. Then automatically, or by virtue of some trigger, my passively suicidal thought become intense, I become exhausted and the cycle repeats. I have been living through this hell for 2 years now and I don't know how many more of these cycles I have left in my. The sheer mechanical nature of this makes me dejected and I induces a feeling of helplessness.

I visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. 
While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to......
Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er.
The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. 
So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.
BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. 
Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State.

Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable.

All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad.

I'm 36 and stuck in years of misery. Depression is my self identity now and I don't know how to change it. Planet earth literally seems pointless and I dont' know how billions of people can just live these meaningless lives.,"I've had depression such a long time and I too feel like its too late to achieve anything meaningful with my life, or even become the most basic description of what most people would consider a moderately successful adult.   I'm 39 working this grocery store job that literally cannot advance anywhere and it barely covers the bills - but it does enough for me to live on my own which I'm grateful for - that is a success I guess.  But I'll be honest as well - the job is fucking miserable all day customer service orientated for snobby rich health-obsessed and trendy people. Being stuck at this job (its the best money I can find now) literally makes me want to kill myself when I leave a shift there.  I've got a manager right now who hates me and if you know what ""constructive discharge"" means that is what seems to be happening at work.

So anyway I recently got hurt at work and typing at and using a computer at home like this is about the only thing I've been able to do for about two weeks now to interact with anyone.  I can't drive very much while hurt like this so it really sucks like I can barely manage to make a trip to the store for some basic shit I need.  I have to get completely whacked on medication (which can be fun if you like it - but I don't like it when it is involuntary) to try to do anything physical around the house (like I HAD TO do this one thing or I'd get a fine) and even then it is just so painful and hard to move.  It will probably be this way another couple weeks but maybe I can heal faster, I don't know.  It seems like doctors where I am just will not prescribe pain medication anymore because there are too many people abusing it - so now I can't get some pain meds when I legit need them which just reminds me of another stupid aspect of our society failing.

I really don't see much point in my living at all when I am just going through the motions of life but I'm miserable.  I can get by financially (so far) but I don't want to just get by while I feel shitty and useless and unable to advance myself.  I hate it and there is no point to living this way - and theres several billion people living out this same lifestyle right now.  I don't know how so many people are ok with these pointless lives - I guess they are happy enough with that?  I am not ok with it at all.  Hurting my family is the only reason I am waiting or haven't already gone through with it.  We don't get along so great right now but I would still never want to hurt them in that way.

I gotta add, just to be honest and inclusive, that I have anxiety as bad as I have depression.  It's almost agoraphobic - like it is actually becoming a fear of leaving my house for the million things that could go wrong.  Being stuck here I am not happy but I guess I am safe.  I shouldn't have to live like this, no one should.

This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak."" It just seems like a dishonest existence...and then I tell myself I'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion. 

I don't really know why I'm writing this here. I guess I'm just sick of talking to myself. This somehow seems a little better. That might be another delusion... ",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1gdxry/depression_feels_more_real_optimism_feels_like_a/,depression

I feel too sensitive to exist,"Being insecure sucks. Not only does it wreck my feelings toward myself, I’ve become fragile to everything around me. To the people around me. I can’t take insults or arguing. I think everyone is mean or doesn’t like me. It feels so silly, but I can’t shake off the sadness.
My first thought when things make me upset is I don’t want to live. I don’t like being this way anymore. I just want to be perfect or at least less insecure. I don’t like sharing these feelings to people, but I want someone to understand.
How do I stop being fragile. I feel like I’m too broken to be around people and I’m happier alone.

Edit: this post is open to anyone wanting to express their feelings. Unite fellow fragile people :)

I can't kill myself until my cat dies,"For as long as I can remember, I've dealt with constant suicidal ideation and intrusive thoughts of self-harm. It's gotten to the point where I feel like suicide is my destiny, because it's the only future outcome for myself I've ever envisioned.

I feel like the only thing that has prolonged my life is my cat. We are very close, especially since I've been housebound with the pandemic. She's always following me around. When I'm upset or crying, she gets in my lap to comfort me for hours. She sleeps on my chest every. night.

Every time I think about committing the act, I start to imagine what her life would be like after my passing. There's no way anyone in my family would keep or take care of her, so she'd probably end up in a shelter, where she'd be confused and depressed and constantly waiting for me to show up. Taking care of her is the only purpose I have in life, and I'm so grateful to her for giving me a reason to stick around year after year.  


EDIT: Thank you for the overwhelming response of kindness and support from this community. I wasn't expecting it, and it made my day. It seems like the general consensus is that I should get another cat, and I agree. It's something I'm looking into, and I'll be sure to update when I get a second furry friend.

"suicide isnt the answer, but people shouldn't call it the coward's way out","I mean someone faced such an awful life filled with hardship, and people are going to call them cowardly? In my opinion, that's seriously low. They don't know what they've been through. How are you going to call someone cowardly if you don't know their story, or have never felt the exact feelings they felt? Everyone processes pain differently. Even though it could be ""no big deal"" for you, it could be pain and anguish for someone else. There is no such thing as a coward, everyone is brave in one way or another.

Sorry for the vent/rant but I seriously hate life... but I'm too stubborn to give up. And I don't want to be called a coward because of the few times I've thought about ending things because they got too hard or stressful. I don't necessarily mean killing myself, but I've thought about giving up getting life together, getting in shape. Because depression is so hard to break out of. But I will always keep trying.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/c6phmz/suicide_isnt_the_answer_but_people_shouldnt_call/,depression

No one showed. I should have expected that.,"I've only ever had one friend in my life. I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.

Earlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook.

She decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. 

We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". 

My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/73o2tr/no_one_showed_i_should_have_expected_that/,depression

Everything hurts,"My heart hurts, my head hurts, my bones hurt, my arms and my legs hurt, my eyes hurt.

Had a massive panic attack last night with my S.O next to me, not knowing that the fuck to do. I cried, said 'help me' multiple times. I can’t do this to him. He doesn’t deserve it.

Now I feel numb. I don’t care about anything. I don’t even mind going to work this afternoon, I don’t give a fuck about my coworkers, my friends. 

If it wasn’t for my parents and my S.O I would have ended it last night. 

The worst part? I thought I was done being miserable. My last months were happy and bright. I felt good. 

But after last night, I feel like nothing has changed and I‘m in the exact same spot again.

I sold my guns.,"They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.

I disappointed everyone that expected great things from me,"When I was attending high school, i was top of my class with a dream of attending an ivy league university, particularly MIT. All my teachers were extremely proud of me. My parents were excited for my future in education. My peers thought highly of me. However, once the middle of my junior year came, i was faced with an overwhelming mental breakdown and fell into a depression.

I would spend sleepless nights doing schoolwork with already unstable mental health or i would do completely nothing and think. I eventually started to think about why i am doing this and realized that i dont like this traditional route im going on, nor will the results of it make me happy as i am already depressed doing the things i should like doing.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes. 

my teachers, parents, and peers as a result started looking down at me, wondering why i became such a ""disappointment"" according to my principal when i wanted to lighten my workload. this put me in the deepest depression of my life as i felt i failed everyone and destined to be nothing. 

i would resort to cutting myself, drinking, taking old prescription pills, and withhold from eating as a way to ""punish"" myself. 

to make this short, i decided to make my main way of attaining happiness is music. that is my dream. everyone is still disappointed in me and it weighs heavy on me. i wish it could go away. 

this was more of a medium to vent instead of ask for help as i am not feeling well at the moment. thank you if u actually do read this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/blpehw/i_disappointed_everyone_that_expected_great/,depression

They expect me to just forget about what happened just get on with life.

I can't sleep, I can barely eat, past rape trauma flooding my mind like a storm. How can I forget, how can I forget that easily when everyday I feel scared and disgusted about myself.

My Dad doesn't really care about me, He doesn't gave me allowance or support me in school. Can't even buy me clothes or other things I need all are hand me downs.

My phone recently broke it's a hand me down from my aunt 4 yrs ago, I tried to get it fixed but I was told by the technician that it's better the I buy a new one.

Asked my Dad if he could buy me one he scolded telling me how clumsy I am, ungrateful and doesn't settle on what was given to me, he even goes on to hit me.

I suffered a black eye but other than bruises I'm good. 

I'm doing my best to get to college and get a scholarship but with recent events it's getting harder and harder I can barely catch up with my online studies, because I need to ration the remaining allowance I have from being a part time Make up artist.

I haven’t gotten out of bed in a month,"I (34f) literally have not left my bed in a month other than to go to the bathroom or get food from the kitchen. I order groceries from Instacart and shop on amazon if I need something. I haven’t showered (I hate the idea of water touching my body) but I have done basic hygiene daily.
I don’t sleep all day, in fact I’m usually up by 8, but I’ll spend my days reading(multiple books a day) , or watching tv on my iPad. 
I avoid calls and texts as much as I can, I just have no desire to interact, but I do respond occasionally.
I’m unemployed and live alone so I have no need to go anywhere or talk to someone during the day.
I have ADHD, depression, anxiety, OCD, excoriation (skin picking) and I take meds daily.

I’m not sure if I’m looking for help and advice or if I just needed to share with someone what I’m going through. But if anyone has advice, tips to help motivate me or even gone through something similar themselves, I would love to know.

24 F I’m killing myself tonight and no one knows,"I can’t even believe that this is it. My heart is pumping through my ears, it’s almost like I’m nervous but I’m ready. Me and my long term relationship broke up because I’m a toxic piece of shit and he would genuinely rather be dead than listen to what I have to say anymore. All my hobbies are dead, I have no friends, I hate school, and I don’t think I was supposed to be alive this long anyway.

I almost feel guilty, like I’m doing this for attention or something. Nobody is going to know, at least not for a couple days. I’m home alone, so it’s the perfect opportunity to do so without thinking about the consequences. My plan is to lay on the couch and hopefully OD while I’m sleeping so that whoever walks in (probably my older sister) doesn’t have to deal with the trauma of gore. I’m pretty sure I have a brain bleed or something going on in my skull from a nasty fall I took, so if that OD doesn’t work hopefully I just succumb to my injuries. I stole my mom’s opioids from her back injury a while ago and have been hiding them in the back of my closet.

I’m leaving my dog a lot of food and water just incase and a note saying that my mom can have him. He’d be happier with her anyway.

I just can’t believe this is my last day. I wish I would have done things differently. I wish I would have went to the mall one last time, or maybe the movies or something. I wish I would have gone to see my sister, and my mom, and tell my highschool bestfriend how much I miss her. I want my second oldest sister to know how much she ruined me as a person, and that this is 100000% her fault. I wish I got to eat my favorite food and watch my favorite TV show one last time. God, I wish I could convey to my dog how much I love him. I wish he could know that if I wanted my last breaths on earth to be with anyone, I would want it to be with him by my side. That I’m sorry I’m so selfish that I won’t be there by his side when it’s time to experience his.

No more fuck ups, no more being miserable and pathetic and a joke. No more never shutting up and making people hate the sound of my voice. No more not being pretty enough, or skinny enough, or sexy enough, or smart enough. Just eternal peace. I’m nervous but it’s time and it’s been time for a while.

One of the saddest feelings is really trying to heal and realizing your depression became a part of you.,"I used to self sabotage and act rather callously. I still do somewhat, although I’ve become more mindful. When I used to feel depressed I felt like I had a reason. Like my anxiety. Or the fact that I drank too much last night. Or that I was self deprecating all day. Or because I spoke/acted on impulse and suffered the consequences. While I still have very bad anxiety, my medication has started effectively dampening it. I’ve also started having fewer ideations in general, and I’ve been trying my hardest for the first time in my life to help myself get better. I stopped drinking almost completely (I sometimes have one/month), when my friends do illicit activities I opt out, I’ve taken away specific triggers, I’ve found a way to hold myself to a flexible eating schedule. But I’m noticing that by doing all of these “good” things I am starting to feel worse, because despite everything I am still depressed. I cannot stand in a single place doing nothing without feeling it. I can’t go to work without feeling it. I can’t have a day off without feeling it. And it’s causing some of the worst thoughts to start coming back, except this time I don’t have a crutch, and I still don’t have any motivation or hope for the future.

I’m sick of being told “That’s Life”,"I’ve been depressed for a majority of my life now. I’ve figured out how to manage and function despite wanting to just quit. 
On rare occasions I end up going to bed and just forgetting about it all to get away from responsibilities despite the consequences. 
I’m still alive. 
Whenever I vent my frustrations I’m told “that’s life” which to me sounds like “I don’t care.” 
Or that I’m too negative and that this is just a stage and things will get better. Or to change my perspective.
None of these have worked cause at the end of the day I’m still facing the same bullshit that is my life and struggling to catch a break. I work from the moment the sun comes up all the way into the night. School hasn’t done anything for me or propelled me forward in life. 

That’s life but I’m supposed to pretend it’s ok when I’m clearly not ok?? I’m stuck in this stupid cycle hoping something will come around just to be denied something good because “that’s life and the time will come eventually.” Eventually as in probably not within my life time. I feel so hopeless and it’s ridiculous to subject myself to these thoughts. I haven’t had a moment where I can just be without the day having the be in preparations for work and school. 

Recently I’ve gotten a haircut which completely destroyed my self image. I’m such an idiot because I did it out of impulse and imagined that it would look good on me. 
I feel like people are lying when they say it looks good because I end up having to explain the whole reasoning behind cutting my hair with some made up bullshit like “it was damaged and extremely unhealthy” then they give me unsolicited advice on what I should’ve done with my hair. That just confirms they were lying because if it was truly fine then there shouldn’t be a “what I should’ve done instead.” 
I don’t want to go out any more or show my face to anyone that may know me because I already had this same stupid conversation about my new hair so many times as work already and a few acquaintances who clearly don’t look at me the same way anymore cause I look ugly now. 
I just wanted to look good for once but did something stupid. 
I don’t like looking at my reflection and I wake up disappointed because I look different and happier in my dreams. 

God. This sucks so much. I feel so alone and trapped. Don’t even want to go outside and my self esteem is in the basement under bedrock. So fucking stupid ",https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1fj6pfe/im_sick_of_being_told_thats_life/,depression

When you’re truly depressed..,Nothing or anyone excites you anymore. Not one single person can turn you on. Music doesn’t mean anything at all.

I've been depressed my entire life. They lied. Getting older doesn't make it better.,"I've never been completely happy . From the time of consciousness, I've never been happy. As a matter of fact I've always been sad. Internally lonely. Delusioned. No mental peace. 

Each year as I got older, my depression would reach certain heights. Get more extreme. 

Around 19 years old, one morning, I woke up and decided I wanted to die. I chugged bunches of sleeping pills and some liquor I found in the kitchen cabinet. I then went back to sleep. I would've succeeded, honestly. My grandma and mom came back from the grocery store . My grandma had somehow made it into my room and accosted me into the bathroom tub . Threw me into some cold water. 

I threw up a bunch. That was the second time I had committed suicide. 

I'm 25 and it's not better. I have moments where I burst in tears. I also realized I'm truly alone. When you're a teenager, you attend school by force. You get to still have some interaction amongst people. Though when you get older, its not like that at all. You can go days and months without speaking to anyone and anyone speaking to you. People can ignore you. Not read your text. People can reject you. As you get older. So reaching out for help can absolutely be useless. 

I don't know what to think anymore. I don't know what to do. I'm kinda tired of it. Trying to find something to pull me out of my mental issues. They never last long. How can someone spend their entire life trying to convince themselves that they should keep living ? How do you convince someone of such a thing and continue to do it over and over and over again. Isn't it a tiresome thought. Who in all sanity should have to make themselves feel like life is worth it?

I was born solely as my parents needed a 'boy',"I am a 32yr old Korean dude, simply born due to my parents' selfishness to satisfy my dad's parents and to not to look as fallen behind within Korean society.

Lol but guess what? That first girl, my older sis killed herself after severe depression throughout her life. And I am the only child now. The boy who was made due to necessity not because of love.

I don't even miss my sister that much to be honest. My family is just made as they needed one not they wanted it. Honestly I don't think there is 'love' in our family and look at the results - first girl died and the later boy is thinking about dying everyday.

My Uber driver had a panic attack mid-ride. Here's what happened.,"It was early afternoon and I had summoned an Uber driver from my home to take me to a friends house to watch some basketball about 25-30 minutes away.

He arrives, greetings were fine, asked me how my day was, standard stuff. Not much talking between us, and honestly I don't mind. Car was clean as well!

&#x200B;

About 20 minutes into our drive I notice he's sort of glancing in the rearview at me like he wants to say something, he starts kind of breathing deep breaths and says: ""Sorry I have to pull over."" I reply: ""Ok is everything alright?."" He says ""Sorry having a panic attack.""

I remained calm and told him, ""Ok that's fine man, I have panic attacks too, I'm not going anywhere important, take your time.""

Luckily he was able to pullover, we were in a residential area with a hill next to us and side walk.

He wasn't really speaking much at this point and I told him: ""I know when I have these attacks I like to be alone, don't worry I'm not in a hurry, I'll be over here on the curb playing games on my phone take your time, let me know if you want to call anyone.""

&#x200B;

About 20-30 minutes later, I told him I could drive him the rest of the way so he could finish his trip and make money, he said to give him a few more minutes. He was able to calm down enough to drive us. We arrived fine, I tipped him told him this is my number if he needs to talk with someone with anxiety as well and went on our ways. I think fresh air and giving him space helped him instead of worrying about finishing his trip with me. Anyways just a small story I had today.

At the end of my first ever session my therapist said something I’ll never forget,"EDIT: WOW! Thank you so much guys for your kind words! I’m in the UK and have just woke up to all of this positivity. I knew reddit was an awesome place but this has just confirmed it even more. We all deserve contentment, thank you so much 💕

So after years of childhood trauma, anxiety and depression I finally got to a stage where I could afford decent therapy and had my first session today. My therapist seems really nice and her little room was the perfect environment for me to feel comfortable talking.

At the end she asked me what I wanted from therapy. As I was telling her all about me and my life, I was constantly worried about her thinking I was overreacting, judging my stories or thinking them not serious enough to require therapy and that I was just a weak person. She looked at my blankly and said ‘is it a big deal for you?’ I said, ‘yes, massively’ and she just simply replied ‘well then it’s a big deal...’, and just shrugged her shoulders and started talking about our next session.

Honestly it was like an epiphany. I realised that if something is a big deal in MY universe, then it is a big deal because it’s me that matters and someone else not thinking it’s serious does NOT invalidate that. I’m always so anxious that my problems will seem silly to someone else, but actually if they really care about helping you get through it, they won’t judge the nature of the problem but try and help you through it anyway because they know it’s a serious problem to you. Your problems are all valid and they’re all worth fixing guys, don’t ever forget that xx",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/hqlsf8/at_the_end_of_my_first_ever_session_my_therapist/,anxiety

"Anxiety Pro Tip: Anxiety thrives on your avoidance. If you have an anxiety-provoking task to do, make it your first task of the day. Otherwise, it'll only start to feel scarier and harder to complete in your mind.","Avoiding the anxiety-provoking task feels good in the short term because your brain feels like it has avoided some kind of threat. This is one of the reasons why procrastination feels so good! However, avoiding the task just reinforces your belief that the task *is* a threatening one, so the anxiety gets more intense the next time you come to it. 

Making it your first task will eliminate this vicious cycle altogether. You'll likely feel better as you'll get a sense of achievement from ""beating"" the anxiety-provoking thing. There is also the added bonus that it won't be nagging the back of your mind for the rest of the day!

Does anyone else constantly feel like they’ve done something wrong after social interactions?,"Basically the title. I constantly feel like I’ve done or said something wrong or offensive and somebody is mad at me after social interactions. Especially with my family and friends. Even if the interactions ended positively and with hugs goodbye and such. I don’t have a bad relationship with any of them. I don’t consider myself anti social. I’ve mentioned this to my husband and some friends and have been told it’s all in my head basically(in the nicest way possible). My husband will reassure me that I’ve done nothing wrong and no one is mad at me, but I usually have a really hard time shaking the feeling and sometimes it even lasts into the next day. It happens all the time. He and others will say even if someone is mad at me that they’ll get over it, probably before I even see them again and I shouldn’t worry about it, but for some reason I can’t shake the guilty feeling. Is this just me?

It can be hard for people to understand how much of a disadvantage this puts you in. It's harder to make friends and socialise, date, work, and even things like phoning the doctor, driving, and shopping can feel like too much to handle.

If you’re starting quarantine or are obligated to stay home just like we are, I promise you’ll get used to it. And not used to it in a negative way! There are so many things you can do at home: I baked so many cakes, I’m trying to do the splits, I’m reading all the books I never got a chance to read. Isolation is reaaally not that bad.

So don’t tell me it’s something I can control, I had a panic attack while thinking about literally nothing.

Edit: Thank you to all the healthy people that replied to this post saying: “We mean well”. I get that. But it’s not helpful at all, when we’re venting and your first reaction is defensiveness.

I took a blanket and a hot water bottle out to a homeless man sleeping under the stairs on my apartment building. I'm shaking and feel faint but am proud I did it.,"It's about 2 degrees Celsius at night where I live right now, for context. As I arrived home late this evening I saw a homeless man sleeping under some building insulation fabric in the outdoor stairwell of my apartment building. 

As soon as I got inside my nice toasty apartment I couldn't stop thinking about how the poor guy must be freezing. I couldn't help but feel such an aching sadness that so many people just would walk past, not doing anything because of their discomfort, just like the discomfort I was feeling. I decided fuck it, show this guy the care and common decency you would want if you were in a similar situation. I found a spare blanket I had, nice and fuzzy and warm, and a hot water bottle I don't use and filled it up with hot boiled water. I was shaking so hard at this point and almost chickened out. 

Barely getting my key in the door to unlock my deadbolt as I was shaking so much, I forced myself to walk outside to him with the blanket and hot water bottle. I apologised for disturbing him, and simply said he must be freezing and to keep both items. He told me I was a gem, and thanked me.

Im back inside my apartment now, feeling like I'm about to faint from the adrenalin and starting to cry from the stress of the situation, but I am so proud of myself. I conquered the anxiety today in favour of my gut feeling and desire to act on my belief of kindness to all.

Does anybody else have anxiety on your days off because you are “wasting” it doing nothing?,"I have been like this for years but I feel it’s been worse lately because of COVID and the fact that I’ve been working from home. I always felt anxious/guilty when I would relax, hangout inside and play video games on my days off by myself. I felt like I was supposed to be doing something productive, exercising the dog, etc. But I was working a more labor intensive job before. I now have a desk call center job and have been stuck working from home since March. So on my days off, if I don’t have plans, I’m still home and feel like I should be out doing something. But some weekends I just want to do nothing, even if it’s beautiful out (I usually pray for rainy days when I’m off so I feel less guilty.) I also hate the heat so when it’s too hot, I don’t want to be outside. AND I usually get house chores done on my first day off so I can relax later but I still am anxious all day because I’m relaxing and playing video games. I feel like I waste my all my days off thinking of things I SHOULD have done and then when I go back to work, I feel like I wasted all my days off thinking of things I should be doing instead of mentally relaxing.

I lost my companion of 18 years. People don’t understand how important a pet can be for people with anxiety/mental illness.,"I adopted my cat as a kitten when I was in grad school. I would not be where I am in my life without his love. Pets hold a special place for people with anxiety.  He was there providing comfort when I had bad days. He gave me purpose when I felt I had none. He gave me unconditional love. I didn’t have to worry about my insecurities around him. He loved me as I was. He was with me when I hit my rock bottom. He was with me during my years long recovery cheering me on and providing support during the low times. He gave me companionship when I would isolate because the world was too much to take.  He was my spirit animal. He had anxiety too and took Prozac. He was excited when I got home and would cry when I left, sometimes when I even just left the room. He loved me and I loved him and I will forever miss him and cherish the blessing he was in my life.

Edit: thank you everyone for your kind words. They do provide comfort. And thank you for the golds.

You are safe,"Hey you. Hi. You are safe in this moment. I know you are scared. It makes sense that you would be scared. You’re not crazy and there is nothing wrong with you. 

Even though you are scared, you are safe. Even though you are scared, you are loved. I love you. I don’t know you, but if people can hate indiscriminately, I can love indiscriminately. I love you. There is love all around you in little, gentle ways. 

When someone smiles at you, they are sharing a small bit of love. When someone lets you pass in traffic or lets you merge, they are offering you a tiny bit of love.

Every “please” and “thank you” is love. Even when something is someone’s job - such as a store clerk wishing you a good day, or the coffee shop person chatting you up per corporate policy. They are still extending love.

Accept the little moments of love.

Accept the little moments of safety, too.

Right now, in this moment in time, you are safe.

It is okay to be afraid. I still love you. Do you love you? You must.

Hold yourself, please. Do it for me. Put your arms around yourself. Pet your face gently. Tell yourself, “I love you. You are safe. It is okay to be afraid. There is nothing wrong with you. You are human and you are feeling afraid and I am here with you.”

Do not treat yourself with contempt and do not abandon yourself for being afraid. You deserve unconditional love. Stay with yourself and be kind to yourself even though you are struggling.

Tell yourself, “I will not abandon you. I will not judge you. I will not reject you just because you are afraid.”

Keep your promise to yourself.

Tell yourself “I love you, sweetheart.”

When you are ready, share a small bit of love with others. Smile to them. Say please and thank you. Wish them well. Be kind. Let them merge in traffic. Do it without expectation for something in return.

Pick up a piece of trash because you love the park. Say, “I love you park. Let me help you feel nice. It’s okay. I got this.” (Even if you just say it in your head).

Radiate love and safety. Receive love and safety.

I love you.

"Does anyone else get avoidance anxiety from text messages, emails, Reddit mail, any electronic correspondence?","Like I enjoy chatting with people in person, over the phone I don’t mind, either. With new people I get slight anxiety but it’s not crippling in any way. 

However, for some reason e-correspondence really gets me. Especially talking to people who are very pushy and demanding for quick replies. I don’t always feel like answering at the moment so I’ll put it off, but then I get very anxious knowing the reply is waiting for me, and I ignore it, and it makes me more anxious thinking the person is getting angry at me, and it’s a very vicious cycle. 

The only time I don’t feel this way is when I’m either very busy working (and then I use the messages as a welcome distraction) or when I take Adderall for ADHD, because then I feel very assertive and have no fear. 

I think the lock down has made things worse because now I don’t go to the gym (usual fear release) and there’s no social time to replenish my mind in preparation for online messages, since they take a lot of mental effort. 

I’m curious to see if anyone else experiences this, and hopefully I won’t avoid your replies 😆

=========

Edit: Lmao this post blew up, and now I have 40+ replies to read. The irony is astounding! But I am to hear everyone else’s experiences too. 

I was thinking more and part of it may be due to the fact that each online message represents another demand on our time and another decision we must make. At least that’s part of the issue. And diverts from our energy when already in an inert place.

People don't want to admit this but Anxietys root cause is because of the people you were raised with,"Yes we can say ""oh stop blaming your parents"" but the truth is, the reason why most are struggling with anxiety is because you had guardians who didn't do a good job of making you confident about yourself.

You are raised with these people your whole life, the people that surround you growing up effect you whether you like to admit it or not. Maybe your anxious all the time because your parents would throw temper tantrums every time you made mistakes and that manifested later on in to your adulthood, maybe your anxious because you had Authoritarian parents that didn't allow you to grow socially, maybe you are genetically prone to being more anxious and the people you were raised with only enhanced that feeling etc.

All I'm saying is, it's so underrated how much parents can affect there children growing up. It can make life alot more difficult than it should be if your not raised with the right people. 

To adults who are going through anxiety, yes its tougher for us but take it one step at a time. Don't compare yourself to others because they didn't live your life. They didn't face the troubles that you did, every small step you take is progress. I have a toxic family who doesn't see any of my small achievements but to me it's big. The past affects your present but it's about how you deal with it that matters.

https://chicagocitywire.com/stories/530092711-roseland-hospital-phlebotomist-30-of-those-tested-have-coronavirus-antibody

Magnifying this percentage to the entire USA population, that would mean the death rate for the virus is 0.015 percent, about on par with the seasonal flu.

some really good news regarding asymptomatic spread! 

Per Wuhan Health Commission, the 300 asymptomatic carrier identified by large scale PCR testing between 15/05/2020 and 01/06/2020 have had their saliva and throat swab sample taken, and these samples have undergone isolation and incubation experiment at Chinese Academy of Science Wuhan. All samples have failed to result in incubation of live virus.

Experts believe the negative result of incubation experiments with the saliva and throat swab sample point at either minuscule viral load, or non-viable viral fragments unable to cause infection. Furthermore, samples from toothbrush, drinking cups, masks, towels and other personal effects have been taken from the 300 asymptomatic carriers, all have tested negative. On top of this, 1174 close contacts of the 300 asymptomatic carriers identified have all tested negative on PCR tests. All of these point at the conclusion that the asymptomatic carriers discovered in Wuhan are not infectious.

I absolutely hate being a high-functioning person with generalized & social anxiety disorder.,"I go through my day and no one knows how much effort it takes me to fake socializing, to fake talking to people, most people just assume I'm a bitch at first until they get to know me because I don't speak up very much but when I do, I sound confident.. but only because I FORCE myself to. 

I get most things done on my checklist. I workout, I eat healthy, I have a degree, I'm in a relationship, I pay my bills, I seem like I have my shit together. But I don't. I spend most of my time over-analzying things I've said, walking around faking everything all day, worried I can't trust anyone around me and over-analzying my relationship, calling myself a loser, telling myself I'm not good enough, having PTSD flashbacks from an abusive childhood. And it's wild that no one has any idea. And I'll never let them know. Because I'm embarrassed.

So if you see someone who seems like they have their shit together or you're jealous, or you think they just don't talk to you a lot because they don't like you.. maybe consider that they are high-functioning. I think we tend to forget that depression & anxiety don't only present as not being able to get out of bed or do anything.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/jgczkl/i_absolutely_hate_being_a_highfunctioning_person/,anxiety

"I had a panic attack while driving, pulled over off the road to stay safe, and someone hit me at full speed while texting and driving. My car was totaled.","I've been diagnosed with GAD and have had a few pretty bad panic attacks in my life. Last night I was driving from my old apartment to my first house I just bought with the last load of my house plants (I had about 35 in the car, it's a hobby of mine).

For some reason I'm still unsure of, I started having a panic attack. My heart rate went up, the pit of my stomach dropped, I felt woozy, broke out in cold sweat, and felt extremely anxious. Right before going onto the highway, I pulled to the side off the road with my hazards on to give myself time to come down off of this panic attack. I called my partner, who was at the house, and told him I was having a panic attack and he  worked with me to help me get grounded and calm. 

I ended the call after about 8 minutes and told him I would call him back when I felt good to drive again. The intensity of the attack was coming in waves at this point, but it was gradually lessening. Less than 2 minutes after the call ended, someone rammed full speed into the back of my car. My car was lurched forward with an awful crunch, plant dirt and debris flew every where, I was thrown forward but my seat belt caught me. I was OFF the road to the side with my hazards on, this guy had to have somehow swerved and not seen my car to have hit me. 

I had no immediate injuries, but I was terrified. I've never heard myself scream like that. The panic attack I had almost gotten under control was now replaced with absolute mayhem of fear and pure adrenaline. The guy came out of his car and approached mine, I was already on the phone with police. He kept trying to give me his license and saying he was going to give me his insurance info. I was sobbing and telling him to wait I'm on the phone with the police. He handed me his license, so I took a picture of it while trying to describe to the location to the 911 operator. He took his license and drove off without getting his insurance. He spoke not great English and I think he was terrified and didn't know what to do. 

The police came with an ambulance. They took my vitals. I had no pain in my neck, back, stomach, or any where. I told the police what happened and showed them the pic of this guy's license. They were like ""WTF this guy gave you his license but not his insurance and drove off?"" That is a hit and run felony. I think the guy was trying to do the right thing but got scared and fled. The police caught him in about 30 mins. Turns out a car with a lot of front damage can't get very far.

My car was totaled, the back wheel was completely torn off and the back axel was twisted beyond repair. Many of my house plant's pots had shattered immediately. I had to leave half of them in the car as it got taken to an impound lot because there wasn't enough room in my friend's car who came and picked me up. I loved this car so much, it saved my fucking life. I was beside myself seeing it being towed away, broken beyond repair, with some of my beautiful house plants still in it. 

I am fully covered for by insurance so they will be paying me out for the value of my car. I will be able to go to the impound lot to get the remainder of my plants and belongings. 

What just strikes me as so fucking cruel was that I had a panic attack and chose to safely move off the road to not put myself or other drivers in danger, and I still got hit and my car was totaled. 

I'm so grateful to still be alive and not in tjr hospital. But I'm scared about what this means for me and my anxiety moving forward. Will I have PTSD from this? Will I be scared of driving/cars moving forward?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/n1smxe/i_had_a_panic_attack_while_driving_pulled_over/,anxiety
Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,"I have really bad IBS with panic-/anxiety disorder and those two combined make it extremely difficult to travel. I don't have a car so I have to use the public transport.

90% of the time when I leave the house I get the runs. Like really bad. Almost always I have to turn back, take a shit and try again. Sometimes it doesn't work and I can't go. Not even to the grocery store for example.

I've used meds (benzos) for it for a while which usually work, but whenever I try to seek help the nr1 concern is "" well you gotta get rid of those pills "". I don't care a flying fuck if I'm injecting heroine if I manage to go to work, leave the house, do normal stuff.

Not even 1% of people can fathom the struggle some people have to just go buy groceries.

I've tried to seek help with this but every single time **only** thing I hear is "" stop using meds "". I've used benzos 3 times in past 3 weeks. I'm improving, no one cares. I'm working on my diet and excercise, no one cares. All I hear is "" stop using meds, stop using meds "". From medical professionals, family and friends.

True, meds might make it so that without them normal things become more difficult. But my goal for now is to travel to work. Any means necessary. Okay I stop meds then what ? No one gives me the step 2.

I've been unemployed for 6 months and my nr1 goal is to get a job, manage to get there and do well.

Thanks for the rant. Peace.

Edit/update:

Had a dr's appointment today.  I told her several times that my only goal is to travel to work. I said very clearly that I still need help, but I didn't care if it was in a form of benzo's, other meds or therapy.

As a result she prescribed more benzo's. And psyllium seeds. Also according to her, stomach problems and panic disorder are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with eachother... sigh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/gwfrjt/today_i_had_a_job_interview_and_i_managed_to_go/,anxiety

How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself,"So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:

At this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down, lay on your back. If you’re sitting, sit up straight.

Once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long, so I don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you’re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. 

**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.

There really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.

Then finally…

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

The best gift I could have gotten on Christmas,"My teenage son has OCD and for the last year+ his brain has been telling him that I am “infected” so he often won’t stay in the same room as me, sometimes won’t talk to me, races away from me and won’t touch things that I’ve touched.

It’s incredibly challenging and hurts my heart.

For Christmas, he said I get a hug. I could see him taking deep breaths (subtly) and preparing himself. I asked how long I could hug him and he said as long as I wanted. When I hugged him, I asked him if I could give him a kiss, too, and he said yes, so I kissed his head.

It filled my heart with so much warmth and peace and happiness and I can still feel it a couple hours later.

I truly understand anxiety and I know just how difficult this was for him. It was the most selfless and loving and special gift I could have gotten.

Also, as a side note, my older son got me an extra gift for my stocking because I’m divorced and this is my first Christmas as a single woman. (I invited their father over last year to help them with the transition, but not this year). My son wanted to be sure I had something in my stocking since my ex always did that for me.

I think I prefer depression over anxiety,"After a very anxious week I feel burnt out. Now I feel just depressed, the kind of depressive state that is tolerable. 

I feel no sadness and anger, I am just tired and indifferent. My brain is so tired that I have no energy to be anxious. That kinda feels good. Without paralyzing terror I can do small things, not overly passionate, but just good enough. 

My baseline is so low, that I feel happy being just depressed.
_____
Edit: I think it needs to be here, ‘Objectively, depression and anxiety both suck, sometimes **the change** from months long depression to anxiety, and vice versa, **feels better**. Then you realize it is not energy or motivation but anxiety, it is not calmness it is numbness from depression. I really hope you will get better and find help, because those changes between those two are sometimes very misleading, and can be a false promise. Do not postpone the therapy or whatever you were meaning to do or start.

I just realised the reason I panic when I make mistakes is because I was punished for mistakes in my childhood.,"One of my earliest memories is from when I was about 4 years old. While I was playing in the garden I fell over and injured my hand. My knuckle was bleeding quite a lot and I still have a scar from the injury to this day. Crying, I ran inside to my mother.

After treating my wound, she spanked me as punishment for my mistake.

If my mother had decided to give me comfort and reassurance in these kinds of situations, maybe in my adulthood, when I made a mistake, my natural response would be to try to soothe myself and calm down.

Instead, when I make a mistake, my natural response is to feel anxiety or panic, and it's really difficult for me to calm down.

I'm hoping that this realisation will be the first step towards me being able to overwrite my childhood conditioning and learn how to treat myself with acceptance and understanding.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/homwjx/i_just_realised_the_reason_i_panic_when_i_make/,anxiety

Dear everyone,  
  
I am writing to let you know I am reading each and every single one of your comments. I made this post because I saw many posts talking about how scared folks are. Truth be told, I am scared too. I'm scared everyday. That's life with anxiety. Sometimes it is really small and it feels like I can just ""ignore"" it and put it in my back pocket, and sometimes it is really huge and like a gigantic elephant stomping around in my brain.  
  
I recognize the tendency in myself to get caught up in negative feedback loops (including obsessively reading about horrible things and obsessing over current events) and decided I would post something somewhat different for us because sometimes, just being honest, coming to /r/anxiety can leave me feeling a bit more anxious, lol.  
  
Whatever the case, I want to thank you all once again for taking the time to share your thoughts and feelings. It is good to know we're not alone. There are so many of us out there who want to see good things come out in the world. I want to share a passage that is comforting to me when things become difficult, and hope maybe it will be of some small comfort to y'all as well.  
  
>""The life of Man is a long march through the night, surrounded by invisible foes, tortured by weariness and pain, towards a goal that few can hope to reach, and where none may tarry long. One by one, as they march, our comrades vanish from our sight, seized by the silent orders of omnipotent Death. Very brief is the time in which we can help them, in which their happiness or misery is decided. Be it ours to shed sunshine on their path, to lighten their sorrows by the balm of sympathy, to give them the pure joy of a never-tiring affection, to strengthen failing courage, to instil faith in hours of despair. Let us not weigh in grudging scales their merits and demerits, but let us think only of their need--of the sorrows, the difficulties, perhaps the blindnesses, that make the misery of their lives; let us remember that they are fellow-sufferers in the same darkness, actors in the same tragedy as ourselves. And so, when their day is over, when their good and their evil have become eternal by the immortality of the past, be it ours to feel that, where they suffered, where they failed, no deed of ours was the cause; but wherever a spark of the divine fire kindled in their hearts, we were ready with encouragement, with sympathy, with brave words in which high courage glowed.""

My therapist gave me some information that was a game changer.,"It was another day at therapy. Going thru the motions and questions, feeling like I was making now progress and pretty much wasting my time down a dead end road. I was telling her how much I hate to pick up phone calls, hate doctors appointments, hate social gatherings, etc. She asked me why I hated them. And for me, it’s just plain uncomfortable. My mind goes to: who’s thinking this about me? why is this person calling me? Why do I have to do more bloodwork? If I don’t put myself in those situations, I don’t have to worry about all those things. 

She says, that’s good! You’re beginning to see the root problem is discomfort. Comfort is something we naturally seek. It’s built in our DNA. BUT! Comfort all the time has a price. Just like too much of anything; coffee, sugar, working out, alcohol. You’ve trained your mind to view discomfort as an enemy. The feeling of discomfort isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In some cases it can be, but in some cases it’s the process of growth. It’s like growing pains. Sure you feel achey but your body is in the process of moving to something better. It’s completely fine to feel discomfort when you start to actually pick up the phone, actually go out and get an oil change, or putting yourself out there to your friends. But the more you do it, the more you’ll realize you can do. And the less it will be in the form of discomfort. Give yourself room to fail sometimes but by all means continue forward. 

It took me a few weeks to think about and process this information until I decided to be brave enough to try. And I have to say, I’m glad I did. Just like she said, I began to see I COULD. And it’s been a game changer. Hope this helps someone else!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/ms6sy6/my_therapist_gave_me_some_information_that_was_a/,anxiety
Please start exercising,"I’ve had absolutely crippling anxiety for the past 2 years. I would end up in the ER, sometimes 2, 3, even 4 times a week because of intense panic attacks. I would have seizure like activity and the doctors thought I was having seizures when I was coming in or I had a brain bleed. It was horrible.

But recently I’ve started working out. I walk for an hour at about 3.5 MPH (brisk pace) and lift weights for about 30/40 mins. Sometimes I’ll skip lifting certain days if I’m too sore or skip walking if my shins hurt too much and use that day to self care and R.I.C.E. to avoid injury. 

When I tell you I’m a different person, I really am. Just after about a week and a half so much has changed. I haven’t had a panic attack or anxiety for about a week. I became a hypochondriac and would worry about every little thing in my body. I have chronic pain so most bodily sensations are extremely exaggerated because my nerve sensitivity. Even when I have bowel movements they can be uncomfortable for painful when most people don’t notice them. I’ve really honestly ignored a lot of them. I can go through my day with my pain pretty much fine now. I’m starting to get some of my natural humor and confidence back. Not much has really changed on the surface, but my mind has healed to what feels like years worth of therapy. 

I’m planning on continuing this, and I would recommend you start if you haven’t been already. Once you start working out you will enjoy it, as long as you ease into it and don’t overwhelm yourself. You’ll start to enjoy it and make goals. And the future will no longer be littered with fears and anxieties, but hope and motivation towards your goals. 

Best of luck to all of you!

Edit: WOAH! I had no idea this was going to explode! Thank you everyone for the awards and your kind words. I wish everyone luck. I’m sorry to anyone who said they’re unable to workout for any reason. I highly suggest trying to contact a specialist (doctor/private trainer/psychologist/therapist etc.) to help you work through any limitations you’re having. Everyone should have at least one thing they can escape to to help their anxiety. 

I do still get some anxiety working out but with time it’s subsiding. What helped the most was easing into it and making sure I was comfortable with my heart rate before trying to push myself.

"I Had a Panic Attack at Work, and My Boss Surprised Me","Hi everyone,

I wanted to share something that happened yesterday. I've been dealing with anxiety for years, but I've always managed to keep it under wraps at work. Yesterday, during a team meeting, I felt it building up the rapid heartbeat, the dizziness, the overwhelming urge to flee.

Before I knew it, I was hyperventilating in front of everyone. I was mortified. I thought, ""Great, now everyone knows I'm a mess.""

But then something unexpected happened. My boss calmly ended the meeting and sat down next to me. She didn't bombard me with questions or make a scene. She just said, ""It's okay. Let's take a walk.""

We went outside, and she shared that her sister also struggles with anxiety. She told me to take the rest of the day off and offered resources our company provides for mental health.

I always thought showing vulnerability at work was a weakness, but her kindness showed me otherwise. If you're struggling, please know that there are people who will understand.

I impulsively asked a girl out yesterday IN PERSON. She told me she had a boyfriend but I'm honestly just proud of myself for even doing it.,"SHe's this girl who works at a local tobacco shop. I kind of knew she probably had a boyfriend and I'd get shut down. She was super polite and it was all good. I imagine it will be ( a little bit ) easier next time I want to do this. I was embarrassed for a few minutes but it passed eventually. Sitting here the next day, I can't believe I did that but I'm proud of myself. Just had to tell someone! Thanks guys.

Edit: Just to add what was going through my mind at the time. My psychologist has really been getting me to expose myself to uncomfortable situations especially when you know they're going to be uncomfortable. I kind of figured she had a boyfriend/didn't date customers or whatever but I considered this an experiment in allowing myself to become uncomfortable, and just sitting with that feeling for a while. It's this kind of stuff that almost literally rewires your brain (albeit small amounts over time). If you keep avoiding things, your brain will get used to it and that's how you end up using avoidance to deal with being uncomfortable. If you expose yourself to those uncomfortable situations and allow them to run their course, those feelings start to become a lot less scary over time which can help build confidence. I'm no Psychologist so that was probably a C+ at best explanation but hopefully it makes some sense.

One of the worst things about anxiety is that a good day with your friends can end with you convinced that they all hate you,"I hate that even if I’m having fun with my friends and meeting new amazing people, I spend the entire night staying up obsessing over all of the little things that I could have possibly done wrong to make people dislike me. I hate that my anxiety convinces me that even though I really did nothing wrong, I must have done something wrong enough for everyone to judge and scrutinize me.

Does anyone else get anxious when they hear any type of yelling?,"Before I start, I want to mention that I have not been diagnosed with anxiety so far, but this is the only community where I feel like I can let this out and ask this question. (Also im new to Reddit and don’t know how exactly this works, so if I do anything wrong please let me know) 

So I’m currently 18 years old and as for my childhood I’d say it was okay. I was a pretty shy and ‘good’ kid so never got into trouble much. That’s also why I can’t recall ever being yelled at or hit. Maybe once, but my parent did apologise and state what they did wasn’t okay so I don’t think that would have affected me.

However, I get so anxious when I hear anybody yell. It doesn’t even have to be directed at me. A few examples: one of my teachers has a pretty strong, loud voice. When he suddenly calls out a student’s name while I’m doing my homework, I pretty much flinch even though his tone isn’t even angry. 

Or a few weeks ago when a classmate wasn’t wearing a mask, a teacher followed them into our classroom and basically yelled at them for at least a minute. While this was going on, I forced myself to just look down at my notebook and focus on anything but the yelling. Though I tried to distract myself, my eyes were teary and I felt a lump in my throat and I was really tense for the rest of that class. I think that was the most anxious I had felt in years. 

My sibling who is 12 can be described as a ‘troublemaker’ I guess. They’re the opposite of me which can be good at times, but it sometimes gets on my parents’ nerves. They don’t listen, aren’t okay with being told “no” and pretty much do what they want when they feel like it. Because of this I often hear my parents being upset at them and I’ve heard my parent yell at them a lot. Sometimes I’d be in the same room, other times I’d be in my room and they’d be downstairs. During these times I’ll also get very tense and just have a horrible feeling. If I’m in the same room I won’t even say a word and just get up and leave because it’s too much. 

I have no idea what to do with this. I have an intake at a therapist next week for some mental health related issues, should I bring this up too? And does this happen to anyone else? I really don’t understand why this happens to me

Does anyone feel like your anxiety has made you less intelligent?,"I want to say those with anxiety are naturally intelligent people , we tend to be vivid thinkers,  over analytical and creative.

I feel like it's hard for me to comprehend what others are saying and I don't have anything important to say. Hell, I don't even know how to ""act"" around people anymore other than my few close friends and fiance.  
My brain is always on , it's exhausting. I obsess about the things that bother me, yet too scared to change them.

On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I’d have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn’t really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn’t. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn’t stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he’s Never been impressed by anyone’s German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do.

"After a lifelong needle phobia, I managed to get my COVID vaccine!","(I'll be discussing needles and medical stuff in this post!) 

I am **SO** proud of myself, and I know only people with anxiety will be able to appreciate the strength this took and how much of a victory it is! 

I have always had a severe needle phobia (avoided HPV vaccine in school, flu shot, refused tetanus and refused all blood tests). It got to a point where I had to get my flu shot up my nose as a spray every year (ridiculous, I know. but the phobia was deeply ingrained into me)

I knew I would finally have to face my phobia again with the COVID vaccine. Because I knew if I freaked out and just avoided it, it wouldn't be just me I was endangering. Since the start of the year, the vaccine is all I've been thinking about. I was *dreading* getting that text message to say it was my turn. And then I was having several panic attacks a day leading up to the appointment. It was pretty rough.

When the nurse called me in and sat me down, it felt like I was going to pass out or puke or burst into tears... but then I just had this... surreal moment of clarity. I just focused on one of the wall tiles and just... almost tuned out of the situation. And then I felt it go in, and it hurt and I was terrified, but also strangely empowered? Like I couldn't believe I actually got to this exact moment without losing it and running out. 

I felt dizzy with relief and happiness when it was over, I think the nurse probably thought I was crazy haha. I'm just so damn proud I've faced one of my fears. My arm is pretty sore a day later, but I'm doing just fine!

This has made me anxious, insecure, and have a low self esteem. I can usually circle back most of my anxiety back to how she has treated me over the years. Some of it came from bullying too of course.

My main point is that: does anyone else with a similar upbringing have any sort of anger toward their parents for some of the mental issues they might have caused? I am now almost 22 and I find myself upset with how my parents raised me. I am trying to pick up all the pieces and push myself in the right direction because in a lot of ways my parents failed. 




**Disclaimer**: let me say that I am not trying to pull a victim card here. I try my best to take responsibility for how I am and am doing my best to correct my issues. My parents have done A LOT for me over the years and I am grateful for that. I just have some internal rage built up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/hd78e8/does_anyone_else_feel_anger_toward_their_parents/,anxiety

UPDATE: Today I had a job interview and I managed to go. No one seems to understand that for some people it's a tremendous struggle.,"As the original post got quite a lot of attraction I'll post an update.

&#x200B;

Yesterday evening I got a call that they wanted me there today. I said sure, started prepping for the journey ( buses/trains are the most difficult part for me ). I ate all the right foods, slept enough, felt good. I took max dose of meds to ""guarantee"" success. 

Even with the meds and proper mindset, I was struggling at the second I left the house. Every step felt heavy, I wanted to turn back instantly. I made it to the first train then to the trainstation which had a bathroom. I had 45minutes to gather my thoughts before taking the next train to the destination.

I got on the train and things just got worse and worse and worse. Every passing stop I just wanted to jump out, crawl into a ball and cry. 2nd to last stop it became unbearable. I jumped off the train and took the next bus home. Mission failed.

I called my employer and was brutally honest about my situation. They seemed very understanding and offered to keep a 0hr contract indefinitely if I get my things together to a stage where I can reliably commute to work. So I made a good first impression and this guy seemed to appreciate honesty instead of me making up some bs lie about "" having some upper respetory symptoms "" or whatever which would've bought me some time. But I like honesty. I don't have to remember any lies and a lot of people appreciate it.

Even tho they were very kind and understandable, I feel like absolute shit right now. For past 7months my **only** goal was get a job, go there, do well. Be normal. Today even with medication I couldn't do that.

I haven't given up all hope yet and I'll start improving my diet even more and hopefully get to therapy asap. Apparently for people like me, sometimes the therapist meets half way if they know that leaving the house is difficult for the patient. Or even comes to your house. So that's great.

This was a major, major setback, but as my dad says "" You do everything you can, and that's all you can do "". I did everything. I prepared for everything. I had everything packed hours before leaving the house. I had a plan for when I get to work. But nope. Anxiety and panic disorder won this battle. Hopefully I'll win the war. 

And what gives a little extra twist to this: Traveling by car is fine. No problem whatsoever. But if I can't get to work, I can't afford a car. And if I can't take the bus, I can't get to work.

- Drinking herbal teas before bed 
- Using a weighted blanket
- Reading  
- Journaling

- Watching / having something on something in the background until you fall asleep
- Alternatively, limiting screen time (phone or television) before bed 
- Diffusing essential oils / spraying pillow before bed
- YouTube videos of distant sounds or ambient sounds
- ASMR videos
- Taking melatonin or Calm (Magnesium Citrate) before bed
- Yoga and meditation in combination or separately 
- Self-care routine before bed 
- Dedicating “worry time” and trying to talk yourself out of the anxious thought spiral early on
- Trying to dedicate your bed for sleep, rather than hanging out there when you aren’t sleepy 
- Taking CBD before bed
- Limiting caffeine and alcohol

I don't understand how people work 40+ hours a week for 45+ years of their lives,"I (23f) am American. I don't know if it is just me, but I am horrified by the thought of working all day every day until I can finally afford to retire (if that ever happens). My current job isn't hard, but it sucks the life out of me. Every weekend is too short, and every work week is too long. I never feel like I am rested enough or that I have enough time to do the fun things I like to do. I don't feel like I have hobbies anymore, and I certainly don't have very many friends. I feel like I have to spend all of my ""free time"" keeping my apartment together or resting to try and prepare for the following week.

I don't know how people do this for the majority of their lives, and I especially don't know how people manage to do this while also raising children. I think of all the things I want out of life, including children, traveling, homeownership, and everything else that comes with that, and I don't see how it is possible for those things to happen working full time. I don't even make enough money to do those things, much less have the vacation time. I'm working on budgeting and building my savings, but the math never seems to work out in a way that feels comfortable. I promised myself I would see Europe before I hit 25 and I don't think that's a realistic goal anymore.

I get stuck in this spiral of ""am I just lazy"" and start to get worried that it is only me. Maybe, somehow, I am the only adult who cannot handle working full time and isn't happy about this being my life for the next 45 years. Sometimes I feel ungrateful. My life is fine - I have a roof over my head and food to eat. I am privileged in terms of the type I work I do. Sure, it is mind numbing and often anxiety-inducing, but it is a job that pays enough for me to stay alive. That's better than a lot of people can say. 

Can someone tell me it isn't just me? Or maybe give me a reality check that it is? I just don't know how I can keep this up for another 45 years. I'm so tired.

Edit: I've taken some time to go through all the comments (though I didn't expect so many) and have really appreciated a lot of the advice i've been given!

hidden ways you’re keeping your body in fight or flight mode,"1. tongue cemented to the roof of your mouth? not only are you tensing your jaw, you’re constricting the muscles in your throat. this can make it feel like it’s closing, and can make you swallow more air which in turn can make your stomach hurt. let your tongue rest.

2. head feel heavy as hell? kinda dizzy and wobbly? like a band wrapped around your head?
tension headaches. your neck doesn’t wanna hold up your head anymore. before freaking yourself out. focus on your neck and shoulder muscles, are they sore as hell? move your neck around. drop your shoulders. massage them. watch how fast your head clears up.

3. feel gassy? like you need to burp or fart or something? you just might. get on your knees, put your ass in the air and relax that butt. drink club soda. do yoga. being too gassy can keep an anxious person in fight or flight. 

4. speaking of butts, are you clenching your butthole really tight for no reason? mhm. your body thinks it’s in danger. relax that thing.

5. let your damn tummy hang out. no one cares. give your guts some room to breathe. then breathe WITH that tummy, not your chest.

6. PLEASE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. BREATHE OUT. DEEP BREATH OUT. HOLD YOUR BREATH. 
THEN BREATHE IN. YOU SHOULD BE BREATHING IN HALF AS LONG AS YOU BREATHE OUT. YOUR LUNGS KNOW WHAT TO DO, BREATHE RIGHR FOR THEM.


you can’t relax your mind if your body is not relaxed. check these off. then calm your mind. i hope they help. ❤️


Edit: regarding #1, i did NOT think i would have to point this out because i believe in the intelligence you guys have but, your tongue naturally sits on the roof of your mouth. by saying “cemented” i tried to relay that putting an unnecessary amount of pressure on the roof of your mouth can keep you in fight or flight or tense. not just lightly holding it there. again, thought my choice of words put that message across. i apologize to Mew zealots everywhere. thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/l5ao32/hidden_ways_youre_keeping_your_body_in_fight_or/,anxiety

My best friend became a mass murderer. I’ve never been the same since that day.,"So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It’s been several years, about 6, and while I’ll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   

First off for context, I’m just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  

[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       

Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn’t help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   

A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I’m pretty sure he either didn’t want to subject me to that or something.   

When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn’t even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. 

When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn’t do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn’t realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  

The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he’d try to change the subject. Don’t get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   

When the murders happened, I didn’t even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn’t feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like “oh let’s smoke a bowl that’ll cheer you up!” And that was when I had my first panic attack. I’m talking full on “I’m gonna die oh my god.” This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn’t sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn’t know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I’ve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it’s caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can’t really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don’t really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he’s never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I’m kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It’s hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can’t focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I’d love to answer, but I’d also love some advice and support. 

Thanks for reading.   

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I’m in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don’t deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that’s stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a “haha I got you” thing that he loved doing.   

Anyways, I’m trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven’t responded yet, I will definitely try. I’ll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously.

Last December I tried to take my life because of my social anxiety and depression. 10 months later I was able to conquer my fears! 

I took advice from a friend as my anxiety was starting to feel uncontrollable. I started to drive to the park every morning, but couldn't get out of the car. I continued driving there every morning to attempt to make myself more comfortable with my surroundings. The morning I got out of the car I was feeling scared stepping out of the car, but as I started walking a sense of pride came over myself. I was so happy I made it this far that I continued to walk and walk and walk and got to experience a joy in myself that was long overdue!

I started to get into a routine, journaling (writing three things I love about myself, + and - things that happened throughout the day, three short term goals I want to accomplish), walking, meditating, etc. I’m just so darn proud of myself! 

One baby step at a time!

However, my anxiety makes it SO hard to do that sometimes, and the guilt of doing ‘relaxing’ things when I should be doing other things, and my lack of ability to concentrate, my angry thoughts, all tend to sweep up that day full of potential and curb stomp it on the ground.

Medication has made me realized how much anxiety I actually had compared to how much I thought I had,"I've had anxiety all my life and this year, especially after all the covid lockdowns, I noticed my anxiety and depression was significantly worse than usual. So I went on medication this time.

Before the medication, if I had a problem at work or with another person, I would dwell on it for hours or sometimes days. I presumed I was just a sensitive person but I've realised it was the anxiety.

I thought my anxiety were just the attacks I had or when it was really bad that I couldn't leave the house, I did not realize I had it every single day. I must have just got so used to having anxiety all my life that it seemed normal to me.

"Anyone else have ""functioning"" panic attacks where you feel awful, but can otherwise appear totally fine to others?","Apologies in advance for the long post. This is something I've been struggling with for a while, so I'm hoping that by sharing my experience, maybe I can finally legitimize what I've been going through. 

I have been having what I now know to be panic attacks since I was very young. Over the past few years, they have been getting worse and more frequent, and most often crop up when I'm out of the house (especially when I'm at work.) For a long time, I actually wasn't sure that they *were* panic attacks, because my doctors/therapists always described something very different from what I experienced.

Contrary to what I was told by my doctors, I often find that I can function (or at least appear to) perfectly well during a panic attack. My heart is racing, my hands are shaking, my chest feels tight, I feel like my knees will give out with every step I take... and yet I can take a phone call at my desk and sound totally calm and professional. I can greet clients and smile and make small talk, and no one around me can tell that something's wrong. (It's almost like I do these things on autopilot, because later, I find that I usually can't remember much of what happened or what was said.) Afterward, when I don't have to put on my ""brave face"" anymore, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted; the shaking and chills take a long time to subside, and I sometimes cry uncontrollably at trivial things. 

I suppose I should add that a lot of my anxiety rests in not wanting people to be mad at me, or not wanting to let people down. Even when I'm feeling really anxious or depressed, I have trouble asking for the time/space I need to take care of myself because I don't want to upset anyone or make them think I'm incompetent. So, I guess it makes sense that even when a panic attack comes on, I still feel compelled to push those feelings down and force myself to appear ""normal.""

I am pretty wary of speaking to doctors/therapists about these types of attacks, because on more than one occasion, I have been told that I'm totally wrong and they absolutely **cannot** be panic attacks, because if they were, I'd be hyperventilating and I wouldn't be able to control them so well. I feel like they think I'm just being overdramatic and looking for attention. Sometimes it really gets to me, and I start to worry that maybe I *am* just being dramatic and I don't ""deserve"" to call them that because there's nothing wrong with me. It's to the point where even if I'm with someone I trust (i.e. my husband or my mom) I usually don't tell them if an attack comes on because I feel like if I did, they wouldn't believe me; from the outside, I'd appear to be perfectly fine. 

Has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? I feel really alone, so I came to you, people of Reddit, hoping that you can help me find some closure.

Stop telling me everyone has anxiety!,"I understand anxiety is a common thing and happens to everyone. But it’s still an incredibly invalidating thing to hear. I’m not sure everyone spends over half an hour picking out an outfit, can’t get on the bus by themselves because they’re irrationally afraid of pulling the stop cord wrong, or overthink everything, down to how long they should toast their bread for.

I don’t think I’m some special case or anything, I know many have it much worse. I often excuse my constant worrying by prefacing to someone that I have anxiety, and hate when they just say “oh well everyone has anxiety”. 

I know that, but sometimes, I wish someone would just say “thank you for telling me.” 

Sorry for the rambling to whoever actually read this.

EDIT: Thank you all so much for responding to my little rant. I’ve been cooped up in my apartment because of COVID feeling very much alone. I’m glad to know I am not alone in how I feel :-)

"This time last year I couldn’t leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure.","I’m a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn’t drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn’t leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it’s just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn’t the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who’s notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can’t touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do. You CAN improve and get your life back. If I did it, any of you can do it. The biggest advice I can give is please, get help. I was terrified but it saved my life. I still go to therapy once a month, and I’m still on my medications, and there is absolutely no shame in that. 

I hope this post maybe inspired even one of you. Dealing with anxiety has been the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I failed at times but didn’t stop trying. No one has to live like this, and no one has to do it alone. I wish everyone here the absolute best of luck conquering your inner demons, and I believe in you.

Does anyone ever feel like they are extremely lonely but are also the one isolating yourself? (Ex: not going outside your house for days but also declining any offers to go out?),"Hi. I’ve struggled with this on and off since I was a young teen. I grew up in the suburbs with immigrant parents and one older sibling who was always out with huge groups of friends or gfs and never home. My parents never ever went out (socializing felt like a burden to them, didnt have too many friends, couldn’t spend too much money) holidays were just another day at home, never anything special. it wasn’t until the last decade now that all kids are grown and they’re retired that they started traveling the world and taking up hobbies and making friends. When I was a kid and I complained about feeling cooped up at home, they couldn’t relate to my anxiety. I always felt like my close friends always had “other groups” of friends or huge families where there was never a weekend or day they’d be home moping. always had groups of friends besides our core friend group, so on random occasions where every person was occupied, it always hit me how extremely lonely I feel.

now, as an adult it still hits me here and there. Everyone knows I’m an extreme introvert and love being home. but lately I’ll be home for 3-4 days straight, can’t bring myself to leave my 1000sq ft apt I live alone in to get the mail, take out trash, or drive to run errands as my simple “socialization for the day.” I have a bunch of things I could be doing outside, errand-wise, or at home (chore-wise, ex: decluttering closets, getting some freelance projects done, job hunting, etc.) but instead I can’t bring myself to do any of them and fixate on my loneliness. 

I let the dishes pile up, eat junk food/instant ramen, just waste hours on YouTube or the internet, sit around crying for no reason, and when people text me to hang out I decline. I don’t understand what’s going on with me, it’s like I’ve reached such a level of being a slob that I can’t bring myself to get ready in 20 min to go outside and hang. My family will even ask to have dinner or something, and the thought of having to coordinate 3 different parties and choose a restaurant and think about 5 hours of productivity I won’t get back (though let’s be real, I won’t be doing anything productive) gives me extreme anxiety.

I’m torn between wanting to bask in solitude and being miserable being so lonely. Can anyone at all relate or is this an issue specific to me since childhood? Am I just a lazy POS and that’s my problem?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/fbq6n2/does_anyone_ever_feel_like_they_are_extremely/,anxiety

I wanted to talk about breathing.  

A very common technique for coping with anxiety is to breathe deeply - you’ve probably heard this or seen it in an infographic.  This is indeed a helpful technique, but unfortunately I don’t think it is explained well and I have often seen users say that it can make their anxiety worse.  This comes as no surprise when in response to anxiety or a panic attack all you hear is “take a breath!”  Great, I’ll do that, thanks.  I’m going to break down the proper technique piece by piece in the hope that it helps someone out.  

When you are anxious many people feel like they are hyperventilating and the answer to that is because you tense up and your breathing becomes shallow and “high up” (your breaths are filling your upper lungs) which makes the anxiety worse.  You are, in fact, hyperventilating, but you can fix this.  You are in control of your breath as much as it may not feel like it in a moment of panic.  

What you want to do is called [diaphragmatic breathing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaphragmatic_breathing) (or belly breaths if you’re a normal person and not in a medical profession).   To demonstrate this, sit up in a comfortable position and place a hand gently beneath your ribs and on your upper belly - concentrate on expanding this area with each inhale.  This is the breathing you are aiming for.  

What we will be doing is commonly called “[box breathing](https://imgur.com/0N53Gah)”.  

Taking belly breaths:

1. Slowly inhale on a count to four (I find through the nose most effective but breathing through the mouth will do you no harm - just keep it slow). 
1. Hold the breath for a count to 4
1. Exhale for a count to 4
1. Hold the empty lungs for a count to 4.  

Repeat until your anxiety eases or your breathing resumes a normal rhythm.  

That’s it!  I hope this explanation helps out someone, I know it certainly helped me.  Practice it when you’re calm and the next time the anxiety ramps up, give it a try.  I’ve also used this technique to steady myself for taking low-light photos and building card towers.  Bonus.

Having a long term anxiety disorder is being happy and confident for more than 2 days and then considering if it’s mania because it’s so unusual.,"Honestly this happened to me, if you read my posts you’ll know I’m mostly recovered from having panic attacks and worrying about everything (6 months without a major panic attack woohoo!) I’ve come a long way with keeping on top of my diet, exercising regularly and forcing myself to be social with family and friends. 

But I’ve been crazy happy the last couple of days due to finally quitting a job that made me miserable. Feeling confident and happy to be social and chat more to friends. I’m not used to feeling anymore than content for a few hours so to feel ecstatic for a few days made me feel like I was going crazy haha. 

It goes to show I’m not used to any emotions in their extremes, including happiness.  I feel like true comfort is being in a ‘meh’ mood. 

After talking to a therapist in the past about this it’s actually very common, chronic anxiety disorders basically put all your energy into coping with one extreme emotion and when you recover it sometimes unveils a tendency to feel very uncomfortable with emotions you did not previously express... like anger, confidence, and happiness. And was actually a trigger for one of my relapses... I was convinced I was an aggressive person that was dangerous because in around 10 years of my youth i did not express anger, not because it was repressed, but because anxiety was my default reaction to everything! I’m not an angry person.. and after a lot of CBT I’ve come to accept all emotions that make us unique and often very confused people! I’m allowed to be happy. I’m allowed to be angry... and anxiety is ok in small doses too. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/amqy1o/having_a_long_term_anxiety_disorder_is_being/,anxiety

Anxiety held me back and lead to me missing things like football games and prom. It got so bad that I had to get home tutors for two years because I couldn’t even manage to leave my house. For awhile I considered dropping out because I literally believed it was impossible to continue. But I couldn’t be more proud right now. I’m IN school for senior year, I WILL be attending my graduation ceremony, and I AM GOING TO COLLEGE!!! Hell yeah!!! So if anyone feels like giving up, trust me if I can get into college with my attendance record looking the way it is, you can do pretty much anything.

Does anyone else unconsciously sigh constantly to calm themselves down and accidentally worry people/piss them off,"I live around Koreans who think sighing is rude, and other people have mentioned that I sigh a lot especially when I am stressed, but it doesn't mean I am upset necessarily or displeased with the person I am with, I just do that to help myself think more clearly and get rid of the anxious feeling/dread in my chest and stomach. It usually works for a bit and then I have to do it again a few minutes later. I was not conscious that I did this until I moved to Korea and got scolded for doing this. Not doing it is almost unbearable physiologically though - I feel like I have to do it to release the sensation in my chest and stomach.

"After bombing at my working interview last week due to panic attacks, I got a second chance with an even better business in a similar role today. I decided to have fun with the interview and it was low-stress and anxiety. I GOT THE JOB.","I am seriously over the moon right now!  This is my DREAM JOB and I can't believe I scored it!  I followed the advice y'all gave me after my last interview and had a ""fake it till you make it"" approach to all interactions with this employer.  I made dog puns in my first e-mail, joked a bit on the phone, and made the whole process fun for myself (which, it turns out, made it fun for everyone else too!).  My anxiety is going to be much, much lower now knowing 1) that I actually have a full time job, 2) that I'll be doing what I love, and 3) It's less than 15 minutes from my new home.

What will I be doing, you ask?  Working with DOGS!  I love, Love, LOVE dogs and have worked professionally with them for a couple of years previously.  I'll mostly be playing with them in small groups, although there will be cleaning and bathing as required (I love giving them baths!).

I feel the complete *opposite* of what I felt going into that second interview at last week.  In every way.  I'm confident, too...  That's rare for me.  Thanks, anxiety.  Seriously, though...

Stop the benzo fearmongering please,"Yes, benzos can be addictive.

Yes, benzos can absolutely ruin your life if you abuse them.

Yes, benzos can have side effects.

But there are millions of people who responsibly use benzos to treat anxiety, panic attacks, etc and significantly benefit from them (myself included) I’ve seen a lot of posts here about people claiming to have taken one benzo and having a massive reaction from them or some equally crazy story about someone taking like 5mg every time. All it does is promote fear and scare people who could benefit from them.

I’m not a proponent of putting anyone on benzos unless they are extremely disciplined about it and don’t have any addictive tendencies and am aware of the dangers but please stop the fear mongering.

Edit: I want to amend this post by saying, if your doctor prescribed you for daily use, I am so sorry. I think doctors who prescribe for daily use are irresponsible. Benzos are a blessing for emergencies but imo should not be taken daily and the doctors who prescribe for daily use should get their licenses taken away.

Remember the 25% rule for social anxiety.,"25% of people will like you and nothing you can do will make them not like you.

25% of people won’t like you and nothing you can do will make them like you.

25% of people will like you but something you do could make them not like you.

25% of people won’t like you but something you do could make them like you.

You can’t really tell who is who in most cases and you have no control over who they are and how they react to you.

So it doesn’t make sense to try and figure it out or try to control it, just let it go. Someone’s reaction or perception of you is not your fault, just do your best and don’t let yourself get caught up using your imagination to guess what people are thinking about you.

Let me repeat the last part.

Don’t waste time and energy worrying about or assuming you know what anyone is thinking about you, using your imagination is most likely not accurate at all and especially if you have anxiety it can’t be trusted anyways.

You don’t need to respond to anything immediately, you don’t need to go out of your way to make sure someone doesn’t think the wrong thing in the majority of situations. It just doesn’t matter and it’s OK for people to be wrong!

So take a load off your mind and don’t let your imagination get the best of you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/fxc59w/remember_the_25_rule_for_social_anxiety/,anxiety
My therapist recently taught me a trick that has been actually changing my life,"It's pretty simple and may seem obvious, but just make up your mind. That's it. Think about a thing, take in all the factors/risks, then *decide* what you're going to do. 

Don't question it after that. You already know you spent the time ruminating over it, you already took in every detail, now stop the cycle of over/repetitive thinking and decide. I know it's easier said than done, but with some practice this can be so helpful. 

Most fear/anxiety comes from the unknown, yeah? I think many people agree about that. We can never be sure what will happen in a future situation, so we tend to spin it *over* and *over* and *over* for no reason. Spinning it again won't make the answer any clearer, just make up your mind and stop. You'll see what happens when you get there, all that you can control is what *you* do leading up to it. 

I really hope this can help some of you. I've struggled with GAD and many phobias/panic attacks for years. This has been the most impactful trick that I've used.

Edit: You guys are the best! I don't have a lot of people to share the news with and you guys have been great! Thank you so much for all the kind words, congratulations, and the awards. This has really made my day.

To those of you who are in the same situation I was in, just practice as much as you can and make yourself do it! You could even do a mock test with the person teaching you to drive. Just go to the place where you plan to take the test and drive exactly like you would during the test. You can have your teacher tell you where to go and end it with parallel parking somewhere. It will make you less nervous during the real test if you feel like you've done it before. Plus, you won't be taken surprise by driving in an unfamiliar area. 

Be sure to know where everything is in the car you are going to be taking, they ask you to turn on emergency flashers, point out the parking break, turn signals, wipers, etc. This is all dependant on where you live, but it couldn't hurt to know of course. 

And my last tip, be sure to pay attention to road signs. Two different times during the test, the lady pointed out signs we had just passed and asked me what they were/what they said. It's easy to forget or miss signs that aren't that important to you, but pay attention during the test at least!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/f2ej20/finally_passed_my_drivers_test_at_25/,anxiety

I used to do this every morning before work when I had a job I didn’t like. I did it all the time for school especially in middle school.

I am so proud of myself and I need to tell someone,"Two years ago I was too scared to leave my house. 

Today I decided to visit my dad an apply for an internship abroad. 

To visit my dad I have to travel by train for eight hours. Two years ago I couldn't get on the bus to go to college.

The internship will be ten weeks long. Two years ago I had panic attacks about going into the garden. 

I feel so extremely proud of myself, even if my family and friends don't understand. I'm starting to be myself again, even though I was never adventurous. 

I finally feel okay doing things on my own.


Edit: First off all I want to thank all of you for the kind words and awards. I woke up this morning and was greated with so many kind and lovely responses. 

I've seen quite a lot of people asking about how I got here. The thing is, I don't have a simple answer (although I guess the answer to anxiety is never simple).

If it wasn't for my lovely SO I wouldn't have gotten this far. At one point he said: I want to go on holiday. We don't have to be gone for long, we don't have to go far away. You can choose the location and if you just want to hang around the hotelroom every day that's fine. But I need a break from daily life. 

I spent most of the holiday in the hotel but I did go for a few walks. Having a panic attack in a different country feels different; the people who see you will never see you again, so it took away some of the shame aspect for me. 

After that summer college started again. I hadn't gone much the year before but I talked to my teachers and they allowed me to repeat the year. I didn't dare to take the bus (my anxiety is centered around being locked up) so I cycled to college every day for a while. 

When the weather got colder I realized I didn't want to cycle 13 kilometres through the snow so I tried going by bus. Not going anywhere, just getting in and seeing how many stops I could survive.

So, I kind of did exposure therapy on myself. I eventually got through the waiting list of a psychologist but by then I could go out by myself. After she went away for pregnancy leave I just pushed myself further and further. 

SO and I moved house in April to a cheap but lovely appartment in a lovely neighbourhood in a small village. I finally feel a bit at peace and I think that caused my sudden progress. 

This probably won't really help anyone as seeing a  professional probably is better than doing it all by yourself. I am just lucky enough to have my SO for support, even if he will never understand how important he was in this process.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/o9ug52/i_am_so_proud_of_myself_and_i_need_to_tell_someone/,anxiety

I just got fired on my first day and I don't know what to do,"I have an anxiety disorder and often get panic attacks. I just got fired from my new job as a cashier in a supermarket. Sitting in the toilet room of a big shopping centre crying as I am typing this. This was my first real job since I finished school in may last year. So today was my first day and it all started really bad. Every bread and vegetable has its own number which I have to type into the cash register. I don't know any of them so I have to look everything up on a piece of paper. That takes a while and I'm not really comfortable with that cash register as I never used something like that before. It took me quite some time to get through each customer and I often had to call another worker to come help me. The line at my register got bigger and bigger. We have 3 cashiers but for some reason all the customers were in my line and my coworkers didn't really care. Then there was that older gentleman, I accidentaly typed in the wrong number for his bread, I apologized and called for a coworker. The man got really annoyed and started to yell at me, I didn't know what to do. The other customers just stared angrily at me and started to express how slow I am. At that point I was close to crying and I got a panic attack. Finally my boss came and explained he doesn't want me here and that I need to pack my stuff and leave. So yea, I don't know what to do, my parents are going to kill me. I'm lost, I can't even have a normal job for a day. 

I hope this is readable as english isn't my first language and I'm still pretty nervous about everything.

"Does anyone else occasionally have ""Time anxiety""?","Time anxiety as in having anxiety that you won't ever have enough time to do something specific. In my case, I always get anxious when my wife has me run to the store or go to an appointment mainly because I fear I won't have enough time to do things that I wanna do even going as far as to get annoyed in my head when I'm told to let the dog out after work...

&#x200B;

I am happy to have plenty of free time once I'm off from work, about 6 hours till I go to sleep so 5-6 hours of me doing what I want but when something simple like letting the dog out, shaving, cleaning a bathroom comes up I get anxiety thinking oh crap I'm, not gonna have enough time to do what I wanna do....how can you get past this? It's obviously silly to me because doing all that takes very little time and when i do have free time I spend it watching tv and hardly doing anything productive...

I was the only student to join the video chat this morning.,"Since we transitioned to online classes, my Spanish professor still wanted to meet with us so we could continue to practice speaking Spanish. When we first started doing this, I wondered what would happen if only one person showed up, and now I know. 

This morning, I was the only student that joined the call for the majority of the session. Another student joined about 10 minutes before the call was supposed to end. It didn't make me panic as much as I thought it would, but I did kinda panic a little bit whenever it took me too long to answer some of the activities.

I did get the chance to have a little bit of a one on one lesson to practice using words in the past tense. We have an Oral Interview coming up soon and I needed the practice because I will have to talk in the past tense. 

It also made me feel a little better about making mistakes (learning a second language is very hard). My professor was very patient when I took a little bit longer to answer some of the questions and was helpful when I couldn't remember some words. It made me feel a little more confident and if I stay focused, I think I'll be able to get a lot of my schoolwork done today.

Paranoia. Constant worry. Incapacity of joy and calmness. All this in a loop. All of this makes me forget about my body. So it accumulates a huge amount of stress.

When my body is relaxed, my mind follows it.

I always forget about this. Always. And if I remember I don't do anything about it because I'm too busy worrying about shit.

Take a deep, really deep deep breath. Hold it. Let it go.

Dance.

Take warm or cool baths.

Comb your hair.

Drink lots of water.

Stretch.

Take sunbathes.

Hydrate your skin.

Put your feet on scented water.

Run.

Ride a bicycle.

Cry.

Walk on the rain.

Get a massage.

Feel the wind on your face.

You are going to make it through this even if you feel like you aren't.  No matter how alone you feel, its just that, a feeling, in reality you have us all with you. This is not a journey you are taking by yourself.

Crying is not weakness, its emotion. Its empathy and you are blessed to have it in the times in which we live. Its a resource even more precious  than platinum.  We aren't broken, its the world around us that is. We just see it for what it is and care enough for those whom are cold.

Stop being so hard on yourself, you are exactly who you need to be. Don't let a day go by without telling those around you that you love them and learn to accept love from others even if you feel like you don't deserve it. You do, we all do.

One race, the human race. One love.

I didn’t think this would get as much response as it did. 

I’ve watched my father suffer from severe panic attacks for the last 15 years. He had to retire early and it took years for him to get disability. 

I watched him every morning with crippling anxiety to where he throws up. He doesn’t even have to leave the house, as soon as he wakes up he’s sick. He’s been on Xanax for 10-12 years probably. It’s the only thing that helps him. 

As a child who witnessed what severe anxiety and panic attacks can do to a family, I never want any of my family to experience it or anyone else out there. There were times my family only made $400 a month when my dad used to make $2,000 every 2 weeks.

I reported the doctor who implied I was lying about Anxiety.,"Today after about 4 weeks of sitting on the idea I finally reported the doctor who implied I was lying about Anxiety in an attempt to get out of work while getting paid. 

What that asshole doesn't know is 1.) I was authorized time off for my anxiety and did not need a doctor's note from him. I was genuinely seeking help and 2.) I got a second opinion from someone who took mental health more serious who gave me a doctor's note to stay out of work for 2 weeks and gave me the suggestion to talk to a therapist. 

I return to my new doctor at the end of next week to see if more time is needed or if medication needs to be prescribed for my anxiety and depression. 

Nothing may come of my complaint but, at least I did it!

It took me years to realize my anxiety was anxiety and not just my personality.,"I only came to this realization recently and it's weird that it took so long when anxiety runs in my family. My mom's been hospitalized for panic attacks. I've had depressive bouts but every time I heard someone mention anxiety, my brain was like ""hmmm. Not me."" 

&#x200B;

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality. I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I don't really know what the point of me typing all this out is, but it just feels good to know maybe there's hope for me. I talked to my doctor and was prescribed zoloft last Friday. I don't know how much it will change me, I know that it's not some kind of magic pill, but just knowing that I'm not alone and that there's a chance to overcome this is so comforting to me.

To anyone else who's having a self sabotage day,"This goes out to everyone who's spent the day laying in your bed, scrolling theough reddit for the past 8 hours because you can't handle today, or don't have the motivation to get up. To everyone who's had a panic attack or indulged in something you shouldn't have.

 I want to send you a message of support in this sea of frustration, panic, and uncertainty. I wish I knew the exact words to help everyone who's in one of these positions today, to be able to make a positive impact in your life, and give you solace. Unfortunately, I can't, but I want you to know that mistakes and slip ups don't define you. Sometimes anxiety is so powerful it feels the only way to drown it out is to mindlessly scroll on your phone, or to have that beer you said you wouldn't have. Being on this subreddit in the first places means you have made a conscious decision to seek support and self improvement. You can get through these days, and if you feel like you can't, please seek out professional help. You are worth it. 

 I had one of those self sabotage days today. My social anxiety has been crippling, I skipped the gym, smoked those cigs I planed to toss out, and spent today watching youtube videos instead of doing my work. I know that on these days seeing a post like this would help me, and that's why I'm writing this, so people in my situation today can see that they aren't alone this Sunday. 

Cheers to making it though these nasty days, and to here's to knowing we'll get through this.

I did it! I asked for a girls number today.,"I'm a junior in college, and I've never dated or even kissed a girl because of my Social Anxiety Disorder holding me back. I was officially diagnosed at the age of 15, and whenever I tried to date, I could never go through with it. I would seldom try to talk to girls about dating seriously, and when I did, I usually canceled or just chickened out.

But today I was feeling good, I think I had done pretty well at an Exam I was studying all week for, and it was almost the weekend.  I was in the class we're in and kept sneaking glances at her. The feeling in my gut surged when I thought about asking for her phone number. I keep thinking of reasons why I shouldn't, even though I know I wanted to. I finally just told my self ""Screw it, I'm doing it"" and threw caution to the wind, ignoring the feeling in my gut.

I asked her after class was over, and she had me give her my number and texted me afterwards. Idk if anything will come of it, but this felt like a huge milestone for me!

PLEASE DONT POST ABOUT YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT!!!,"My mom posted several times on her Facebook talking about my recent hospital (psych ward) stay. (I’m 19, was 18 at the time, like it matters anyway, you shouldn’t post anyone’s personal info on social media whether they are your kid as a minor or not) Luckily she didn’t mention the psych ward part but I asked her to take it down because it’s private and no ones business but my own and my doctors but she didn’t so I had to resort to publicly commenting;

“Mom, please take this down. As I said in person I would really prefer it and strongly ask that you dont talk about my mental health or my issues on your Facebook with people whom I don’t know. I love you, and no offense to anyone who’s read this post, but this information is private about me and I do not like that it has been shared without my consent.

I'm quitting my job due to anxiety. I feel like a failure.,"The day has finally come. After six years of teaching, I know I need to quit. My acid reflux and insomnia have gotten so bad that I feel like dying most days. People keep telling me to hang in there - that teaching gets better with time and experience.

Now I need to figure out how to tell my supervisor. I know it's going to be a huge disappointment to him. He needs me. My school needs me. My students need me. But I need to put my health first now. I can't imagine what everyone is going to think of me. They will probably think I'm crazy or weak or both.

Sometimes I don’t realise Im doing it and other times I’m fully conscious but I just can’t stop. 
If anyone does this and can relate please comment I’m very interested, also if anyone has any tips on how to stop please help me by commenting that too🙏🙏🙏",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/kl63gb/does_anyone_else_bite_the_inside_of_their_mouths/,anxiety

"Things that helped me manage my anxiety, maybe this can help you too","I am taking Lexapro and doing therapy, but I also made a lot of lifestyle changes have made a huge difference, so I wanted to share my list. 

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

I no longer have suicidal thoughts,"Well actually I haven’t had it for maybe weeks now, not since January or early February. In my head, what started off as a thoughts of how to kill myself if I reach my suicidal phase turns into a “I want to die.” But I realize that I can’t kill myself, because I can’t do it, it’s not in me, it’s in my head but it doesn’t tell me to do it. I never attempted it and can’t even cut my arm. So I stop having it because it’s not gonna happen.

For a while, I think the reasoning behind this is because I’m a coward, I couldn’t end the pain of living so I have to live like you’re half alive and half dead at the same time. Recently, I talk about this to a lad I know, and he said that wasn’t cowardice, that was bravery. 

Because despite all the shit that happens to me and around me and in the world, I still choose to live. Despite growing up in a dysfunctional family, despite not studying that much in school and potentially not getting into college, despite the world being a shitty place where the rich gets richer where the rest burns in hell. Despite all of that odds, I’m still here. Not living fully, but still breathing, that’s a plus for me I guess, I am crawling but I am moving slowly. I went to sleep that night and give myself a smile in the dark because why not? It’s a command given by a brain, but a smile.

"Shoulders tense? Jaw clenched? Chest tight? You deserve better.

Repeat this for a minute or as long as you need, and you will feel better. Try to smile if you can because it does help a bit.

But today my dad made me a grilled cheese for dinner and I ATE THE WHOLE THING!

"Does anyone have a ""hangover"" period following a high-anxiety/stressful event?","Such as attending a concert, speaking in front of an audience, or anything that makes you nervous?

I used to be fine going to shows, concerts, anything. I liked it.  
But ever since my first ever panic attack I've been physically ""shaky"", even sometimes when I am not even mentally worried at the time.  
It's like my body turned into a chicken.

Now when I attend an event, I sometimes feel stress symptoms.  
Then after the high excitement/stress event, I sometimes get a ""hangover"" period. I feel so exhausted and sometimes hungry.  


This is when the heart palpitations sometimes kick in. I feel my wrist and it's sometimes about every 5th beat, and sometimes about every 20th beat. These heart palpitations give my chest a weird, uneasy feeling. There's this vague but strong discomfort in chest area, to the point where the thought of going to the ER crosses the mind.

Then I go to bed, get lots of sleep, and wake up still tired when slight anxiety-like tremors the next day. But then as that day progresses, it starts to feel a little better.

Reminder: Anxiety is suffering a simulation,"The suffering is real but you're suffering a simulation. It's not real. 

It's imaginary. 

It's all lies.

A part of your own mind made it up so it can't be an actual danger.

Actual dangers come from outside you.

Fear is meant to protect you from danger. 

But when fear overworks and causes life to become a living hell, it loses its whole point of existence.

Fear isn't meant to make you suffer endlessly, it is only meant to spur you to act in defense for a short while. If you keep looping in a fear cycle, fear has defeated its own purpose and should stop functioning.

There is a reasonable amount of light fear called Eustress that is justified and keeps you on your toes in a hostile environment. Anything more than that fear, anything that paralyses you, that hinders your full functioning, that prevents you from thinking straight, that prevents you from working according to a plan, is excess fear, and by definition has defeated its own purpose. Such fear has no point existing.

The higher number of times you affirm ""I'm actually safe except for XYZ"" the the faster you will feel better.

Remember, unless you're actually in an active war zone or shooting, you;re quite safe. Say it to yourself - ""I'm actually quite safe except for XYZ"".

Finally, remember: Hot flashes, crawling ants, crampy, pain, tingling, needles and other sensations, are _discomfort_, not danger. 

Discomfort is uncomfortable, but safe.

You aren’t dying.,"You aren’t dying. You don’t have a rare disease or cancer. No tumors or some weird flesh eating virus that hasn’t been seen in decades. You aren’t going insane. You don’t have MS, or any other genetic disorder. You have anxiety. May I suggest a list of good vibes for this spooky season?? 

1) love yourself. Actually mean it though. Look in the mirror and instead of analyzing your body over anything that appears to be different tell yourself how amazing you are. 

2) drink water, I mean lots of water, drink some liquid IV also. Comes in many flavors and it’s a lot healthier than other drinks. Try to lay off the sodas (however treat yourself every now and then)

3) sleep. I mean sleep like you never slept before. Go to bed earlier, turn your phone on airplane mode and just let the cold room engulf you as if you are in the Arctic (that’s how cold I love it) 

4) eat healthier. Try not to eat chips, junk food. Baked chicken and veggies are great always. (Again treat yourself every once in awhile) 

5) breathing exercises. This is a great way to relieve stress and anxiety. Did you know breathing can help with a lot of medical problems? I suggest you read a book called “Breath” by James Nestor. It’s an extraordinary piece of work.

Remember to love yourself and remember that I love you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/q2emiu/you_arent_dying/,anxiety
Really missing the pre-COVID world when my severe anxiety was just cuz of regular trauma lmao,"Hi beautiful people ❤️ Just wanted to vent here over the same feelings everyone else probably has. 

I’ve been watching a lot of shows (haven’t we all tbh) lately and seeing people living normally onscreen makes me so sad. I’ve become so used to how we’re living now that it sometimes trips me out to see people without masks on TV. I hate that going to the grocery store gives me intense anxiety now and that Wal-Mart feels like a goddamn battle zone for me lmao. I hate how paranoid and helpless I’ve been feeling. I hate that I’m afraid to leave my house and fear every time my loved ones do too. I hate that my boyfriend and I feel like we’re in a long distance relationship when he’s only 40 minutes away haha. I hate that I can’t hold my baby cousin and see his chubby lil face. I hate that I can barely see my loved ones outside of the house and I worry about them every day. I hate that I have to plan how I can do basic things like going to the post office or going to work just to minimize exposure. I hate that the government where I live is basically useless in keeping us safe and they just keep prioritizing money over our health. I hate that almost no one in Hawai’i (where I live) is taking it seriously anymore, tourists are still coming in, and our numbers are literally tripling by the day. 

My OCD and anxiety has kicked into an intense high gear ever since this happened and it’s so emotionally draining. And it doesn’t help that every extreme precaution I take for my parents sake, they don’t follow. Whenever I get home from work or the store, it’s like a 30 minute process of sanitizing all my belongings that I brought, showering, washing my clothes, and cleaning my hands a million times. But my family doesn’t do the same so I’m worried that it’s all for nothing. We’ve luckily been ok for the most part and I feel privileged to be able to say that. I feel a little silly complaining, but as a house full of essential workers (aside from my dad who got fired from his job at the beginning of COVID after 19 years) I’m just constantly on edge. I just wanna protect all my loved ones and I feel like I can’t. And I know I can’t. I just wish I could.

You will smell things, look at things, listen to things, become genuinely intrigued with what people say, or everyday hobbies. 

I promise this bullshit is not permanent. Just keep finding yourself and growing. You are still growing emotionally, spiritually, etc, even when you don’t think you are. And one day you will all of a sudden realize, “holy shit, I’ve came so far mentally from that pit I used to be in. “

Anyone always have a show playing in the background to help anxiety?,"For me it started a few years ago when I lived by myself and I couldn't take the complete silence. It just gives me too much free brain space to focus on my other senses. With sounds in the background, it's a bit easier to drown out stuff like heart palpitations or thoughts about how scared I am. I mean, it doesn't stop anxiety and I still get anxiety attacks but it does soothe me to an extent. So if I'm by myself, I have something playing almost all the time, usually from when I wake up to when I go to sleep, but especially at night. I wonder if there's any harm in playing sounds all day long. I don't play it loud but maybe the constant stimulation has a negative effect on the brain. Either way, I can't stop now, I just get way too anxious without anything in the background and I prefer a show with people talking to a white noise machine.

So, anyone do that too? What shows do you watch? I usually just rewatch shows old favorites, and I leave new shows for when I actually want to pay attention. I've been playing Friends and Brooklyn 99 a lot recently.

Edit: This got so many replies! I appreciate everyone who took the time to comment. Pretty awesome that all of us here have the same experience, makes me feel less like a weirdo because my ex used to always be amazed how I can just rewatch the same show over and over for weeks.

Does anyone else just hide when people are outside of their house?,"  Just like the teenager memes about hiding in your room when company is over, I'm in the adult version of this situation. I'm one of those teenagers who is now grown with a home of my own. There's a guy working on my roof and I've been in hiding all morning. 

  I can't let my dogs outside yet or they will bark and draw attention to me. I can't go too close to the windows or he will see me. I can't watch TV or play music or he will know I'm here. I have to tiptoe around my house so it seems like no one is home.

Hadn’t Left the house in four years update.,"Hello all, I wanted to give an update on my progress in hopes to maybe inspire just one person to take that first step.  4 1/2 years ago I had a complete mental breakdown due to a number of stressors and my alcohol abuse reaching critical mass.  Prior to this I did suffer from anxiety for years but was still able to hold down a job, have a social life and be a relatively good father to my children.  
    After being house bound for 3 1/2  years I wasn’t able to walk to the mailbox without having a panic attack. I was so depressed and defeated I didn’t see the point in even existing anymore. I felt I had nothing to offer this world so in what literally felt like a life and death decision I reached out for help. I called my local  NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) chapter and tearfully admitted the hell I had been going through.  It felt so liberating just to hear my voice letting some of that pain out. After a half hour or so on the phone, the women kindly suggested I start talking to a therapist via video chat. I did some research and decided on a company called betterhelp. I was assigned a counselor and she helped me to come around to the idea of medication. I then began video chat sessions with a psychiatrist with a company Teladoc. I was prescribed 15 mg (after a gradual increase) of lexapro.  My wife of coarse had to pick up the called in script from the pharmacy. The first two months were not good to say the least, I had a lot of side effects but I pushed through and by the third month i started feeling a little bit of my confidence returning.  I would take little walks a couple hundred feet from the house.  I started to white knuckle drive around the block.  In May of this year at 5 months of medication, on a Saturday morning something in me clicked.  I just said fuck it, jumped in my car and drove a couple miles down the road through multiple stoplights to a Home Depot, went inside and made a purchase. It was TERRIFYING!  I was a nervous wreck but by the time I made it home I was so stinkin proud of myself I was gitty. I came right on here to reddit and announced my crowning achievement. 
     In the time since then I push myself everyday. Little by little expanding my comfort zone.  I now can drive anywhere in the city, I have even taken the freeway to the next city over. I go for walks with my family to the park. I have gone out to dinners and reconnected with some old friends. Most importantly the quality time out of the house with my children has returned me a mindset that I do have value, and I do have something to offer this world.  I still have down days but overall I am happy and proud of the progress I have made.   
    For me the combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy has proven to loosen the chains of anxiety but none of this would have been possible without taking that very first step of many first steps,    Asking for help!   From the bottom of my heart I wish all of you the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/dyfwbm/hadnt_left_the_house_in_four_years_update/,anxiety

"Feels like I am constantly bracing for the next ""bad thing"" to happen to me.","Title pretty much sums it up. I feel like I can never relax, never live fully or happily, because I am simply constantly mentally preparing myself for whatever next bad thing will happen to me. For example, I finally met this pretty great person, we had a great time, and yet somehow, even when I was most happy with them, I was mentally preparing myself for the inevitable fact that it would fall apart (and it did, but, granted, that was because of lockdowns and stuff).

Health worries are also pretty prominent. Whenever I'm pretty healthy, I can never enjoy it, because I frankly am just getting ready and thinking about what next health woe will be thrown my way and how I will be miserable because of it. Even now, I have a problem where I literally can not stop thinking about worst case scenarios, regardless of likelihood. I have done everything I can -- called my specialist, set up an appointment, and will receive the next step in treatment, and I have refilled my current medication to treat it. And yet, here I am, worrying obsessively about infection or something -- despite me having this problem for three years and my worst case scenario not coming true. (\*\*knock on wood\*\*).

I can't relax. I can't stop bracing for the next bad/uncomfortable thing to happen, and even when I am doing everything I possibly can, I don't feel good enough to live my life. I am tired and miserable. I know I need a therapist, but office closures make it tough to do so, especially as I want to see one in person.

Who else has anxiety about not doing enough with their life?,"To give a brief backstory, I graduated college in Spring 2017 and was still working as a barista at Starbucks. About two months after graduation I started to really feel the effects of my anxiety. I was panicking that I didn’t already have a better job and that I was gonna lose my apartment because I couldn’t pay bills. After relentlessly searching until February 2018, I found a job as a sales rep at a cell phone store. Since February, I’ve been doing great! I’ll be making about $40k a year and after five years of struggling with bills, I can comfortably afford my apartment!

Now, since about April, I’ve been having anxiety, again, about me feeling like I’m not doing enough. I’ve been relaxing a lot, going out to places with friends (because now I can afford it,) and playing a lot of video games(it’s always been a hobby.)  But I’m feeling pressure to go back and get a masters in the hopes of finding a better job and really going for something that I actually dreamed of doing. I just can’t find the will to break away from this relaxed mood the change in pay has given me. Every time I try to give up playing video games and going out with people, in hopes of working towards something, I go right back into this comfortable routine.

Nobody will probably read this but if you do....,"Please know that I’m **SO** AMAZINGLY proud of you. 

Every single day.

You might not know me, and I might not know you... we’re literally strangers! *I HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU PEOPLE ARE!*

But to step up to the subreddit, post online about your personal problems, is brave as duck. 

 Please give yourself credit. Do you know what you did by simply posting that post about (x) ?? Someone might relate to it, and need help on (x) , someone might just be interested in (x) and read about it, someone might be going exactly what you’re going through, but remain silent... maybe they’ll speak up because of you!!

With one push of a “POST” , amazing things are sure to come with it... you spoke up about it... and that is SO GOOD! 

You’re more amazing than you know. You matter to me, if that means anything. 

Take care.

Please stay safe.

If anyone needs me, I’m always just a message away!! I don’t mind listening :) love to hear from new people!!

Keep your heads held high, hope you all have an amazing day / night... wherever you may live! 

Love you all!

#Edit 

I’m sorry I ended up falling asleep! It was 3 am or so when I wrote this, and I thought “only a couple of people will see it” ... boy, was I wrong. 

Thanks for the awards, someone mentioned that someone wrote something similar, but its hard to find that post.. — something like that - so I’ll try my best to contribute a lot more here; probably a weekly thing! Like a weekly check up , see how everyone is, and such :) 

I’m just about to read the comments now, and reply!

#Edit V2

We all have that thought of “this looks so dumb” , “why am I doing this?” when about to post online on a subreddit, and in social media in general... 

Know all those TikTok “famous people” ?? They are human, too. They probably were sure as ducky duck scared to post online for others to view , judge , comment , like , etc.,, but now look? They are perfectly okay with posting whatever — even sometimes the silliest, stupidest things... those who comment “I wish I had the ability to do what you do” ... *You can* 

Nothing is stopping you. You are only stopping yourself! 

With one little push of a “post” could change your life.. change someones life, emotions, thinking process.. think its scary , right?! It is!!

Yes , anxiety...other mental illnesses... but THOSE DO NOT DEFINE YOU. You are more than your mental illness. Don’t be afraid to do what you love, and keep doin it! 

I am with you every step of the day.

Corona killed my anxiety,"Basically,  having to work from home and not go out to socialise has given my mind and body a much needed break.  

Working from home means that I don't have a lot of the job related anxiety that makes me dread Sundays and Mondays. I am also able to save on the 2 hours of commute and so I have a lot more free time.  

Not having to wake up early means I get 8 plus hours of sleep every night. I didn't realise how much lack of sleep was affecting my mood.  

Not having to go out means I no longer need to worry about my IBS related stomach problems. I also no longer feel pressured to socialise (im an introvert by nature and love staying at home and playing games / watching tv). 

With all the time I have, I finally feel like I am no longer running behind the ball, and have the time to reset, rest and do the things I love, without judgement. 

It just feels like the wonderful break ive always dreamt of but never thought possible.

Yesterday and last night, I was so worried that I would get depressed that it turned into anxiety. Then I began worrying that I hadn't done enough while he was away that it created even more anxiety. 

I woke up drenched in a cold sweat this morning and called in sick. Now I'm anxious that they'll be pissed off that I wasn't at work yesterday.

"I decided to fight for net neutrality, even with social anxiety. It has been the easiest thing ever.","I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.

So this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes — whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology — it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion — something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.

The main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...

**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: ""Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.""

**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer — often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.

**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom — it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, ""You're doing great!""), and it automatically calls the next representative.

-----

At the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.

Long story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.

P.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.

**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. Turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like I made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. It also means I actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7ern0j/i_decided_to_fight_for_net_neutrality_even_with/,anxiety

Long story short, I liked my ink and decided to share it in the tattoo subreddit. I didn't expect to get so much negative backlash about it facing the wrong way. I didn't mind the comments that had actual criticism on the ink itself, but there were just so many comments just shitting on me and enjoyment over it.

Does anyone else find themselves having anxiety about having to get up early in the morning?,"I'm 27. I've been trying to get to the root of my anxiety and this morning, while driving to work, it dawned on me (no pun intended) that the source of my anxieties might have to do with my disdain of having to get up early for work.

I have a problem where I can't stop thinking about work during weekends, when I'm home at night, on vacation, etc. Work dominates my thinking, but in an unproductive way. I don't go over anything specific, I simply ruminate about the fact that I have to do it. A lot of it has to do with my disdain of not being able to have full control over my time and having to sacrifice so much of my life to a job.

I typically end up having a decent day at work, nothing wild. Every now and again I'll have a hell day. I often fear having those days, weeks in advance, and they typically never come, but they eventually do. 

Going back to my time, a massive hurdle for me is accepting that I need to get to bed early so that I can have enough energy for the following day. There is something about that...and it makes me feel powerless. It feels like the rest of my life is just a waiting room for work but I realize how absurd that sounds. I know it's untrue, but we also live in such a hyper industrial and profit-addicted capitalist society that I know (unfortunately) that what I'm saying has some form of validity to it, and I wish it weren't so.

Anyone else experience this? I'm a grown guy with a career and yet here I am, at the best job I've had to date, miserable about having to go to it because it means I don't have full control over my time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/quvxse/does_anyone_else_find_themselves_having_anxiety/,anxiety

I'm really glad about that. It was tempting just to have someone next to me. Waiting for real love is worth it, even when you feel like you'll never meet your soul mate.

The list I keep on my phone to help me calm down during high stress and anxiety,"Not sure it will help anyone else but here is a list of stuff I keep on my phone to help me calm down during moments of high stress and anxiety.  I have been slowly adding to this list over the past 4 years when I first started experiencing daily panic attacks and now I find myself rarely referring to it. Hope it helps someone else!

&#x200B;

**Note to Self**

* Give it 20 minutes.
* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.
* The more I say “fuck it”, the better I feel.
* It’s just your thoughts.
* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.
* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.
* What’s the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.
* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don’t focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.
* You don’t have to do anything.
* It’s not what I have to do. It’s what I want to do.
* If you feel doomed, that’s because that’s what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn’t going anywhere.
* Don’t be afraid of your anxiety.
* You are the play, and the world is your audience.
* You shouldn’t be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.
* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don’t have to do anything.
* The best thing to do is not think about it.
* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there’s nothing to worry about.

(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)

&#x200B;

**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**

* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.
* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.
* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.
* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.
* Repeat.

&#x200B;

**AWARE Calming Technique**

* Accept the anxiety. Don’t try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.
* Watch the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.
* Act normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don’t try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.
* Repeat the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You’ll see that you’ll calm down soon.
* Expect the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don’t focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.

&#x200B;

**Other**

* As cliched as it sounds, I really recommend trying to live one day at a time. You're overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much/fix too much/make too many decisions at once. Try to breath, enjoy each day as it comes, and give yourself small goals to get back on track.

I’m not doing well.,"I just need to get things off my chest.

The truth is, I’m not doing well. I’m so overwhelmed these days, and I can’t relax. Something is always on my mind, something is always bothering me. I’m constantly irritated, and it’s frustrating. My emotions feel invalid — I have a home, I have food on my table, what do I have to be upset or stressed over? I feel so disconnected from myself and from others. I’m afraid to reach out to others — I’ve definitely pushed a lot of people away this year. I don’t know how or if I can bounce back to whatever my *normal* was.

Edit: WOW, I did not expect to get this much feedback, but I thank each and every one of you for the advice and kind words.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/jtj1t2/im_not_doing_well/,anxiety

I (F17) told my dad about my anxiety and got unexpected reaction,"Posted it on r/relationship but got removed. The mods told me to post here instead.




English is not my first language so please neglect any mistakes. I've always suffered from mild depression and social anxiety. I'm sure my parents know of it because of my mental breakdowns and also because my dad is a doctor himself. I love my parents but they are just too busy with their life and profession. They're hardly even home. They've remained uninvolved in most of life.


So this happened a few weeks back. I was really troubled because of school, couldn't sleep and was having a meltdown. I don't know what came over me but I went ahead and woke my dad. I asked him to come to the living room while sobbing. As soon as we sat on the couch, I poured my heart out to him. He didn't say anything. Except a few ""hmm""s and nods. Lastly he calmly asked me if I would like to meet a friend of his ( he didn't directly say a therapist ). He then went ahead to tell me that my illness is valid and seeking help won't deem me as ""crazy"". I refused and went to sleep.

The next morning as usual my parents were not home but my lil brother (M13) was there. He asked me if I had talked to Dad about something. I acted confused. He then started crying and telling me that I should have told him if I was suffering so much. I calmed him down (which took quite a while) and afterwards he told me that mom and dad were talking about me. Dad told mum to make sure that the environment of our home was a happy place for me and they were planning to make time for me/family by taking some time off. 

I've never ever felt such love from any thing or person. I'm so so blessed. I'm just so thankful for my family. I feel like I can endure anything. I just wish I would have leaned on my family for support earlier. Please everyone if you're suffering, reach out to your loved ones. It can make a world of difference, I promise!



tl;dr - reached out to my dad and got unexpected support and love from family ❤️

I (41M) stood up for myself in a relationship for the first time in my life. It cost the relationship but I feel great about valuing my needs. Use meds if you can people. I wish I started sooner.,"She told me kissing me wasn't worth it. She said she won't be able to give me a family I wanted so what's the point. She could have been discussing the weather. 

She then in the same breath asked me to help her with a presentation. 

She is a doctor. Makes 4 times more then I do. She is accustomed to getting her way. Saying things without consequences. 

Not this time. Not with me. 

 I stood up. Told her she needs to reevaluate her wants in life and I'm going to give her her space. 

I left. She messaged me. She wanted me to go on a trip with her. She said she was willing to pay.

 I asked her ""what's the point?"". 

Before meds I would have been at her beck and call. I would have been in shambles. I would have given her opportunities time and time again. 

I will miss her mother. I will miss her dogs. I won't miss being treated that way. I am saddened that I'm alone again. But I'm effin proud that I drew my line in the sand and refused to budge. 

If you have the opportunity to seek help, use meds etc please do so. The power and self worth that comes with less anxiety is amazing.

If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...," A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you’re not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it’s a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It’s easy for us to fall in the trap of “freezing” and never do the things that we *know* calm us down. I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I’ve struggled for years and... I’m still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone <3

Job hunting when you have an anxiety disorder...,"I honestly feel like if there was one thing that could perfectly trigger my anxiety attacks and tick all of the boxes that trigger my panic attacks, it would be job hunting. And it has.

Questioning my overall self-worth? Check.

Questioning my few skills? Check.

Panicking at long job descriptions where the words blur together from said panic and nothing makes sense because my brain stops functioning as my heart palpitates and my hands shake? Check.

Feeling like an overall failure because I don’t qualify for/get rejected from a job? Check.

Becoming overstimulated and hyperventilating from the sheer amount of positions to scroll through? Check.

“They expect *all* 45 bulletpoints of this from me? I’m not capable, I’m just a jack of all trades, my brain would explode on a daily basis, I can’t do this.” Check. 

Re-doing my resume 35 times because it’s just never *perfect* enough? Check.

Not being able to decide what I want to do with my life and thus experiencing an overwhelming desire to just give up? Check.

Catastrophizing my situation, which then turns into full blown panic attacks on a weekly basis because I haven’t heard back from any jobs and thus being convinced I’ll be unemployed forever? Check.

Job hunting is a soul-sucking experience for everyone involved. At the same time, I’m convinced it’s one of the most unbearable experiences for people who struggle with GAD. Or at least it seems to be for me.

Typing this after waking up today to find myself finally recovering from two straight days of panic attacks coupled with some fabulous depressive episodes thrown in. I was knocked completely out of commission after a week of overworking myself with the job hunt, and spent two days crying, shaking, taking Ativan when needed, and feeling like “nothing will ever be okay again”.

*Sigh.*

Back at it.

What having Anxiety look like:,"No motivation. 
Isolating yourself. 
Listening music to escape from reality. 
Craving unhealthy food.
Pushing people you love away.
Biting nails.
Your leg shaking uncontrollable. 
Spill mascara. 
Shortness of breath.
Overthinking. 
Negative thinking. 
Sleep problems.
Sleeping  to escape from reality. 
Crying.
Disassociation. 

Having anxiety is probably one of the most lonely,  most isolating things to have. Because you are your own worst enemy.  And you live inside your head.

Got cured of Generalized Anxiety Disorder! Here's what worked for me!,"Hey guys, I have been an avid follower of this sub for a long time and this place has been a constant source of panic attack relievers over the last few months. In my last session with my therapist, he told me that GAD is cured after 6 months of literal hell and dedication. I want to share what worked for me.

**Background:** As with my fellow GAD sufferers, I have been suffering from constant worries and usual panic attacks over the last few years but I decided to take action about this (didn't know it was GAD back then) after a full-blown attack that lasted for hours and hours in early May this year. Started my treatment late May. In one of the panic attacks I was contemplating committing suicide but thank god I had the courage to stick to my routine.

**Symptoms:** Luckily, never had any physical symptoms but diarrohea and mouth ulcers were common because of cortisol developed by Amygdala.

**Aftermath:** I am waking up everyday with a buoyant mood and my life including social life, dating life and academic performance, all have improved!

So, let's finally begin:

1. **Therapy:** Can't emphasize this more, CBT therapists will identify the problematic and impractical thought patterns associted with your Anxiety( especially if it's Cortex-based) and suggest you ways to cope with them via ABCDE, RRR techniques and so on. Some of these will work for you will and some not but these people are medical experts and you need to spend 2-3 months with a therapist before deciding to discontinue/move to a different Therapist. Self-therapy books do help but it's always better to have someone in the form of close friend or a therapist to assist in your journey.
2. **Reading Books:** Rewire your Anxious Brain, The Mindfulness and Acceptance Workbook for Anxiety, and My Age of Anxiety,  are the top 3 books I recommend. Finally, I'd suggest reading posts on this sub. **Caution:** there are chances of feeling uneasiness or having panic attacks by reading few content so make sure you tell your brain that this is medicine beforehand
3. **Meditation:** atleast 2-3 times in a day for 12.5 mins everyday. It's only one day in the last 6 months I missed doing this wonderful thing.Buddhist style of meditation worked for me. Mantra meditation, guided meditation are other alternatives. There are wide variety of resources available online. It could be possible that you don't see the effects in the initial few weeks but I'd suggest keep doing it blindly.
4. **Gym:**  6 days a week non-stop in the last 6 months except for the weeks when I was travelling. It's scientifically proven that doing physical activity for more than 20 mins almost everyday improves mental health. Technically, doing exercises helps the body release endorphins that rearrange the synapse between the neurons if done for 10 weeks to see a significant results. This is massive in improving thought patterns
5. **Being open:** Being open about your anxiety with your closed ones will enable to learn new strategies, perspectives and many more things. More importantly, you will have shoulders to fall upon during a full-blown panic attack

**Others:** practicing gratitude daily, practicing my hobbies( soccer).

i had to leave a movie theater last night.,"Movie theaters have always freaked me out because they are, well, a target for shootings.

I still try to go. I have fun and it's a good way to get out of the house.

Last night I went to the premier of a movie. I was already feeling pretty bad because there was a line out the door, which we didn't expect because our town is so small and filled with old people and oilfield workers. But it was whatever, we got through and went into the theater.

Right as my heart began to try to settle, a man in the row next to me begins talking about his *gun.* that he *brought.* he made 2 remarks about it - the first one i tried to brush off because i thought i misheard him. the second one i did NOT mishear.

so my heart starts racing again and i'm shaking and starting to cry. i tried SO hard to keep it together because i was with my fiance and we were trying to have a date, yanno? but they were super understanding and did not mind at all that we had to go.

i know that i overreacted but i just really can't wrap my head around being comfortable in a confined space with a random stranger carrying a lethal weapon. especially at a premier night at a theater.

I'm angry at everyone who didn't notice I was struggling as a child,"This turned out to be quite a long ramble/vent but I just needed someone to listen.

I recently started the long process of getting a diagnosis and help for my anxiety. I haven't even gotten to a psychiatric nurse yet, not to speak of a doctor or an actual psychiatrist, but I have talked to the nurse who took first initiative in my case. She was very kind and offered to meet me face to face a few weeks before the psychiatric nurse appointment so I wouldn't have to wait well over a month to get any progress at all. During my appointment with her we quickly got to at least one of the reasons as to why I'm so anxious and it helped me realise that I have actually been prone to anxious behaviour from a young age.

What's now bothering me is that after the appointment I started to realise that I was indeed displaying signs of anxiety or trauma responses as a child but none of the adults in my life actually noticed it or cared enough (or maybe knew enough) to do something about it. Absolutely no one. I had both of my parents and many many teachers who just ignored all of it and that is probably one of the reasons I'm such a mess today. I did not get the help I needed as a child and now everything is a million times worse.

Now every time I get an anxious spell I cannot stop thinking about how the people who were supposed to care for me failed me horribly. It got even worse yesterday when my mother told me a story of her completely ignoring some quite alarming behaviour because she thought it was just a quirk of mine. I had an event I consider traumatic during my first ever swimming lesson in 1st grade. Long story short, the swimming instructor was angry screaming at me because I, as a 7 or 8 year old child, couldn't float on my own yet. After this event I completely stopped doing everything that had to do with swimming even though playing in the lake with floaties on was one of my favourite summer activities before the incident. I didn't continue swimming until over 5 years later when I finally learned how to swim due to mandatory swimming lessons as a part of school sports. Even now almost 20 years later I get anxious at the smell of swimming pools and chlorine and I avoid swimming halls, especially the one where it happened.

Yet somehow, my own god-damn parent, who was often overprotective of me, didn't think there was anything alarming about that. She was telling the story like it was just a weird little thing I chose to do, one of those funny little childhood anecdotes. And the swimming incident is just one of the many different events I remember, where I displayed anxiety symptoms and no one took them seriously. I just want to be angry and scream at everyone who did not notice my problems but that's never going to happen and I know that one day I will just have to make peace with the fact that most of them will never know how badly they failed me.

Consumed by regret after missing out on life for 26 years.,"I am 26 and have not lived. I've never learned how to swim, never learned how to drive, never had sex, never been in a relationship, and never left my hometown. I am a 15 year old in an adult body. Barely passed high school and college (<3.0 GPA). Got fired from my first professional job during college in under a year for performance issues. Graduated college and haven't found a full-time job after almost two years. Still live at home. Feel like imposter around people my age and younger in long-term relationships, marriages, and careers. 

I was diagnosed with GAD in my last year of university and have been through five therapists on-and-off over the past ten years. I was never really one to blame my upbringing for personal issues, but it's difficult not to resent my parents and society to some extent. Single mother, absent father, low-income household. The impact it's had is obvious, and I recognize the same emotional immaturity and dysfunction across my family. 

The acute anxiety I experienced in my teens and early 20's has shifted toward an increasingly all-consuming grief of my adolescence. It is becoming harder to wake up in the morning. My last hope is landing a decent job and being able to buy some lost time, but at 26+ it's hard not to feel like my inexperience is exponentially insurmountable toward developing a fulfilling career and intimate relationships.

Anyone not having kids because of crippling anxiety?,"If I didn’t have such bad anxiety, especially health anxiety, I would probably want to have kids.

I ate after 5 days.,"I knew it was time to eat. I have emetophobia ( the fear of vomit ) & it has stopped me from eating for the last 5 days.

Today, I was going to go another day without eating to avoid a panic attack. But enough was enough.

I had a few fries, a chicken nugget & 3 bites of a burger. It wasn't much, but it was something & I'm so happy. 

It was hard to swallow & chew, but I managed to do so calmly :) I go to the doctors tommorow to get anxiety medication as well!!

UPDATE : I got the medication. Before taking it, I was having mini snacks like smoothies & crisps. Then for dinner my mum brought home KFC & I could barely eat it. So I decided to take the first pill, very worried.

At first I was confused as to how to feel about it, I just felt numb. But then I started eating, without a thought in my head. No nausea, no dry throat, no rapid heartbeat. I ate my first BIG meal & feel no guilt. I truly feel like I've found myself again.

I have gone into panic attacks because I feel nauseous. I will do *anything* not to vomit even though I know it's completely irrational and stupid. I haven't been diagnosed with any phobia, but I'm pretty sure it is a phobia. Anyways, this anxiety will make me nauseous, and then nausea will make me more anxious until I'm in a feedback loop.

Edit #4: As a medical student, I think it's my duty to tell you guys that the treatment for anxiety is based on therapy and medication. Anxiety is due to your negative thoughts due to any past experiences. You need therapy to fix your thought process, and that decreases or even eliminates anxiety If you have really bad anxiety, medication will help you cope. But it's not the solution because your bad thought process is still there. Meds are good to get your symptoms in control.

You need therapy in all cases of anxiety. 

You do not always need meds. Meds are for those people who are having a harder time coping with their symptoms

I drowned my baby sister in my mom's birthday,"First of all, excuse my English.

This happened almost 8 years ago, I was 8 and she was about 4.

It was my mothers birthday and we were going to have dinner with all the family (like we always do), adults were outside the house preparing everything, I was on the second floor of the house, with my little sister.

She started crying, it was her baths time but all adults were busy, so I went to the bath and prepared the bathtub, when everything was ready I put her at the bathtub, with champoo and that kind of stuff. I left her alone there and I went to the first floor to watch TV.

When adults came back they asked for my sister, I told them that she was upstairs, having a bath, they seemed worried and they went to the bath, I followed them, I didn't understand the situation.

When we entered the bathroom she had drowned, they took her out of the bathtub and she was almost blue and really cold. Everybody got really nervous, they called 911 and stuff.

So, basically I killed her.

The relation with my family has never been the same. I am still in therapy for it, I have tried to kill myself time ago. In addition I was adopted so I spent months thinking that my family was going to ""give me back.""

My mother has told me several times that it wasn't my fault, but things will never be alright, I know that she is still disgusted of me.

I quit my six-figure job to recover,"This was possibly the hardest decision I’ve ever had to make. I’ve been at this job for 5 months now and the workload was immediately unmanageable for one person but I kept pushing through thinking I was just weak, I needed to work harder. After all this was an opportunity of a lifetime and others would kill to have this job!

It got to a point where my anxiety and depression was out of control. I dreaded work every morning and was crying 3 times a day every day for a month. I couldn’t stomach any food until dinner time. I wasn’t taking breaks and I was doing 12 hour days. Exercise was out of the question of course.

I knew I needed to quit but I felt like I couldn’t. I didn’t want to be that person that gives up. On top of that I felt incredibly guilty that if I did quit, my workload would be dumped on my boss and the team. I was (and still am) anxious about what people think of me. Do they think I’m a quitter?

All I was focused on was others and I forgot about me. How sad is that. 

The past week I managed to scrounge up the pieces of myself scattered across the floor and peel myself out of bed at 6:30 to run in the morning. I may have severe anxiety and depression but this is the one thing I can do for myself. 

I still have this nagging thought that I am crazy to throw away this salary but at the end of the day no amount of money is worth trading in my mental health for.

I don’t have a fully laid out plan of what I’m going to do but all I know is right now I need to heal and recover. Financially I am okay and my angel of a partner is supporting me in this.

I am by no means on the other side yet but I thought I would put this out into the world for anyone else who feels stuck in their job and afraid to quit. Feel free to DM.

UPDATE: Writing this update on 10 June 2022 (a week out from 1 year ago). Thank you to everyone that commented at the time. Your encouragement really helped me through a tough time. Over the past year I have consistently received private messages from people that have gone through or are currently going through the same situation.

At the time of my original post I felt so alone because I couldn’t find other people going through the same thing. I thought I would just be sending a rant into a black hole and it wouldn’t mean much but it has really been worth putting out there just to see how many people have reached out and the conversations that have come from it. 

As an update, I took 2 glorious months off and looking back, quitting was the best decision I ever made. I was ashamed and guilty for a while but I had the gift of TIME. To do things I wanted to do that had nothing to do with work and to heal. Of course I had incredible support so I could focus on building myself back up. I’m now back at work at a previous job (before the heinous one referred to above) and I’m doing well. I still have anxiety obviously but off anti-depressants now.

If you’re ever in the same broken state I was, I know that hesitation so well. I know its a tough decision but I still 100% recommend quitting. A career is not the entirety of life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/o0ovub/i_quit_my_sixfigure_job_to_recover/,anxiety

Does anyone else avoid the news these days?,"Hi, all. Is anyone else having to almost completely avoid the news right now? I almost feel like it's ""attacking"" me when I listen to it or watch it, ramping up my anxiety levels & frankly making me feel almost paranoid. I'm having to stay off Twitter entirely, and off FB as much as possible. It's all so awful most of the time, and there's nothing I can do about it. I feel a bit guilty sometimes, thinking that as an adult I've got a duty to keep up with the news, and also, as a Christian, I ought to be aware of what's going on in the world so I can at least pray for it. I have trouble even talking about certain subjects now, because it can set me down deep, dark rabbit holes and trigger a depressive episode. And, although I feel really lonely and isolated, I still need to be careful what I expose myself to - for example, a friend of mine keeps pushing really scary conspiracy theories which does my head in. I don't mind talking to her about almost anything else, but not that, as once I've spiralled down, it can be days before I haul myself up again!

I was trying to explain to my mother that I've got really burned out and feel hypersensitive. I'm not proud of myself for it, as I'm sure I'm not being very mature, but there's only so much fearmongering a person can take, and like many people (I suspect), I've been fearmongered half to death over the past few months.

These days, we're all connected 24/7 and there's almost no hiding from anything. We ""have"" to think about Covid all day, every day - we're not being allowed to put it out of our minds for even one second. When I was growing up, we had news programmes, of course, and newspapers, but somehow, it wasn't in our faces all the time & we could take a break from it. Also, the media seems to have been more trustworthy back then, even if it wasn't - at least, there wasn't all this fear of ""fake news"". Part of my problem these days is the feeling that i can't even trust what I read any more.

So I try to focus on other things: watching TV shows, knitting (I'm making soft toys to give to people to cheer them up a bit!), listening to audio books and podcasts, learning Irish on Duolingo and also praying, as I find that a comfort. It's hard though!

Anyone else getting really anxious with all the COVID restrictions lifting?,"I am slowly realizing where my anxiousness has come from over the last couple of days. I have been handling my anxiety quite well over the last few months after having figured out some of my major trigger. With numbers going down in my city, restaurants are opening back up and people want to meet and socialize I have felt much more anxious over the last few days. 

I got quite comfortable in my covid routing and bubble over the last year. It hasn't taken all of the anxiety away but reduced the social aspect by a lot (maybe not to my long term advantage though). 

I have vacation time planned in the next few weeks and just had an anxiety attack over planning on where to go/what to do for just a couple of days. Last year a friend and I planned to take a trip together, which we now had to cancel because I could not get vaccinated early enough. Now we want to spend the time together in some other way and while trying to find some options closer to home I realized what I have been so anxious about. Going out, meeting other people, stepping out of my routine and comfort zone. Its crazy. I used to thrive with travel and new cultures/people and today I caught myself hoping that guidelines won't be relaxed so that I have a good excuse to stay in my bubble.... 

I have honestly no idea what to do with this. I need to stay careful and take precautions for my physical health (pre-existing conditions) while I cannot neglect my mental health but am not sure if its better to just go for it or let my anxiety dictate my vacation plans and social life again....

The worst thing about anxiety,"You know what the worst thing about anxiety is?


How lonely you feel during it. We all experience it on our own and even if someone is next to you, they still don‘t feel the same fear as you do in that moment.


All of us have to process our emotions and impressions by ourselves and that thought alone makes me feel so lonely.


The way I‘m shaking right now because I am so scared, no one is here and awake. I‘m crying and even if they were awake they couldn‘t help me because the fear is deeply rooted inside of me.


I just want a break man, I‘m tired of feeling like dying over things that have many solutions to it.

Today I ate in a restaurant by myself,"I’ve had anxiety for around 6 years now, sometimes it is more debilitating than others and I’ve had a phobia of choking on my food for the past 3 years. Eating out tends to be a really difficult process for me even when I’m in company I’m comfortable with, I’ll often end up giving up and not finishing my meal because I think I’m going to choke on every mouthful. I’ve never eaten in a restaurant on my own in my life. 

Today though I thought “fuck it” I’m not living my life around this fear anymore, so I popped into a small Thai restaurant near my home for lunch. I sat at my table and I ordered some food and I ate.

Is it normal that my psychiatrist basically FREAKED out on me for being 4 minutes late to my appointment?,"They burst into the waiting room and said, ""Come ON, you are late! I have a very tighy and strict schedule!""

They then proceeded to RUN down halls ways and corners to their office. Since this was my first in person visit, I also had to run to keep up with them, since I had no idea where their office was.

They roughly take my vitals while saying ""I am a very punctual person. I have 2 other clients to see in 8 minutes, so we will have to make this quick.""

By this time, I am basically hyperventilating and near tears, apologizing fervently and seeping into an oncoming panic attack.

They are asking 100 questions and not listening to my answers. Shouts out some random antidepressant I haven't tried yet and says, ""I'll call it in. Start it when you get it. Next  visit is telehealth, sign on at LEAST 15 minutes early to make sure your not late."" (This was my first time being late. I've been seeing them for 9 months.)

Then they shuffle me out the door.

I submitted something in late and I was so sure my boss was going to blow up on me that I paced around for hours at home, but he called and was very understanding. It's exhausting having to live life as a panicky mess.

I hate constantly feeling like someone is mad at me,"It’s so tiring to constantly worry and have to check with people if they are mad. It makes people feel like I make everything about myself. When in reality I just need to make sure nobody is upset. I have a constant need to be liked and loved. I know everybody pretty much wants these things. But I get sick and feel extremely horrible when I even get a slight hint that someone might be upset with me. It’s just so tiring. I hate it and I feel like I can never be completely normal. I’ve made immense progress but it’s never going to be normal again. I can’t stop feeling guilty for everything I’ve ever done. And when I confess to family members about my guilt they act like I’m worrying about nothing. 

I obsess over things that happened years ago. And can’t let them go ever. I just cannot stop obsessing over things that probably didn’t even involve me or that nobody remembers or cares about anymore. I’m tired of thoughts that I’m a horrible person. I’m just so tired of it. It gets old to never feel comfortable with myself. The only times I do is when I’m in a group of people having fun. And I’m able to make them laugh. Whenever I’m alone and that connection is gone I just panic.

At this point I’m worried that I must be high maintenance and just need a lot of attention. I just want people to like me. I literally cannot stand the thought of people hating me. And I know there’s gotta be people out there. I know and understand why people get upset at my guilty feelings and confessions. It’s just hard to stop. I feel like I need reassurance which is a short lasting fix.


Edit: I’m kinda thinking this might be because I’ve forgotten my anxiety meds for a few days. Uhhh whoops. Well im going to get back on track and see how that helps. But I’m so nervous I can’t stop hyper focusing on one situation and it’s been a year and it wasn’t even a big deal when it happened

Society treats those with anxiety like garbage,"I've seen how most people treat someone whose anxious. Society treats those who are anxious or timid like garbage, play things to troll and fuck with. It's not just young people who bully those who are anxious, there's a culture of not taking anxious people seriously, not at all trying to sympathize with reasons why they might be that way.

People are animals, if you show even the slightest nervousness they pounce, they double down and try to stress you more, or laugh at you, ect. I've seen this from young, middle aged and old, from people of all cultures and background, it's absolutely disgraceful.

I haven't self harmed in one whole year.,"The last time I self harmed was about a year ago. (I know, even more depressing because it was near Christmas!)

I have been dealing with anxiety and self harm for three and a bit years now. I didn't ever think I would get a mental illness and the fact that the self harm evolved from that was even worse. It's so weird to think that this one thing happening in my life changed everything for me. It was all very sudden as well. I started locking myself away from friends and family, school became a hell hole and I was just alone with no idea what was going on with my head.

 I never got treatment. My mum tried to get some woman to help me, she came to our house and I swear to god...she was useless. I appreciate the fact that my mum wanted to help but there was apart of me that didn't want the help. I'd been living with this monster for so long, it started to feel like apart of my identity now. I was scared that I wasn't 'ill enough' or I would be wasting my time there, they wouldn't actually care and they were just greedy for money. Thinking about it now I understand how crazy that sounds of me to think like that but who could blame me from the state I was in?

My dad started to notice and became infuriated with me. It's difficult to explain to people who haven't gone through it, so that just made it worse. A few people that did stick around would pop up on my phone, and it was constant. They wanted to know how to help and even I didn't know what exactly was wrong with me. How can someone help if even you don't know what's wrong? I had completely lost touch with the real world.

Three years later, it's still extremely difficult but I persevere...because even though you may think it can't get better, it always does. I used to RAGE when ever anyone told me that but it's true.

To be honest, I don't think I will ever overcome my mental health, but I've been doing incredibly better thoughtout those three years. I've grown as a person, I've learnt new things, experienced new happy memories and I'm actually going to have a clean, joyful Christmas. This present time in my life is currently the happiest I've been since. The best part is that I'm thankful. Of course there are days when I think I wish it wasn't around but my mental health has taught me so much and made me stronger. I am thankful! So...THANK YOU ANXIETY! THANK YOU!

Remember to love your brain and your body. You only get one life, spend it the best way you possibly can. Give yourself breaks, if you are having a shitty day don't force yourself into anything, take a day off and pick yourself back up the following day. Don't let anyone tell you that you aren't 'ill enough' to get treatment or that your mental health makes you 'worthless'. There is so much more to life than pain and suffering.
And most importantly... Congratulate yourself for getting past even a couple of days, a few weeks, a few months. It might not seem like much to you but every extra day you don't self harm, you are beating it! I believe in you all.
Learn to love your brain <3

Or I get so anxious that I disappear from the friendship entirely and that’s why they don’t like me anymore, because I abandoned them. It eats up at me.

I’m very grateful for my cat,"It’s 2:00am and I just woke up in a panic. This happens at least 3 times a week. My heart is racing and I’m breathing fast and I can tell that a tunnel of anxiety is about to consume me. Initially I don’t know why- probably a nightmare but I can’t remember what I was dreaming about. Then I start thinking about everything I have to do today and all the time I wasted yesterday laying around the house when I should have been getting things done. My heart is still pounding in my chest and I feel nauseas but at least my breathing has slowed.

Then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. Focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. She usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until I fall asleep again.

I don’t know what I would do without her. She does this when I’m awake and anxious as well but it really helps me fall back asleep at night.

First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

Guys—for the first time in my life I stopped a panic attack before it started.,"I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there’s no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like “oh no you don’t!” I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy—namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I’m so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you’ve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this!

Please stop medication shaming,"This is a PSA to the anxiety community. It's bad enough when you get it from people who don't even understand the concept of having anxiety, it's 10x worse when it comes from people within the community who also suffer from anxiety disorders.

Goddamn I get it left and right from fellow anxiety sufferers the very moment I mention that I'm on medication. It always turns into preaching. You may think you're helping, but you're really not. There are many different preachy topics people get into, but the main sentiments are ""oh, you're just not strong enough and are weak and leaning on the meds because not using them would be too hard for you."" Or ""oh they're really bad for you if you keep taking those you're going to end up with dementia-cancer by the age of 30"" 

Fuck off. I experienced something traumatic. I was not able to handle it without the assistance of meds. Therapy alone did not cut it. Going for walks outside or whatever didn't help either, which some people smugly like to suggest. I was in so much fear that I literally disassociated from myself. Meds kept me from being hospitalized.

I got shit from my doctor and people on here (not this sub specifically I haven't commented here before). You're going to die horribly for being on those meds! be afraid! be scared! feel ashamed!

Well guess what, I found a fantastic therapist who completely understands my plight. In one of our first sessions when I told her that the meds saved my life and that therapy alone wouldn't have ever helped, she IMMEDIATELY agreed and was like ""oh yep definitely. It's too powerful of a reaction/feeling. I know."" She herself experienced some trauma from her past, and she told me that when she stopped drinking and was on an anti-anxiety med for her panic disorder someone smugly told her ""oh so you dropped one addiction for another."" Oh boy did I have some shared anger with her over that. 

I really don't care to hear anyone's ""help"" or ""advice"" when it comes to my choice to take medications. I don't want your shaming, or how you were able to overcome your issues without medication, good for you. I don't want to hear how bad it is for me health-wise. There's this holier-than-thou preachy mindset disguised as sympathy and I fucking hate it. OOooOOoo they're so bad for you! Guess what's also bad for me? Not eating or sleeping or fulfilling basic biological needs to survive due to fear. Hm. Wonder which is worse?

I would rather live a shorter happier life due to relief from my anxiety due to meds than live a long tortuous life because that's what people say I should do. My doctor was brutal to me about being on the meds until I said essentially that to her, and then she finally laid off. 

And addiction doesn't happen to everybody. I had someone lecture me on how this medication I was on was going to give me a full blown addiction until I told them that once I was doing better I just simply got off of them and was off of them for months. They sure didn't have anything to say to that. 

So bottom line, stop shaming people who choose medications, if you want to celebrate that you're so healthy and untainted by pharmaceuticals, go do it somewhere else. Not everyone is that lucky. Yes I'm bitter.

edit: to be clear all of this mostly comes from the fact that I take **benzos,** which are apparently a big no-no to many people. I'm not sure if I would have had the same experience from people if I were taking non-benzos. People really love to scare me about those.

I brushed my teeth!,"Hi, everyone.

I don't tend to post here but I really wanted to tell someone that would not be disgusted by me. 

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency. The dentist explained to me that I have beautiful teeth that just need some TLC after not brushing them for years. I remembered that about a year ago in Aug 2018, a friend gave a company-wide training on dental health. She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

With all this information in mind, I've been saving up money to go out and buy a Sonicare toothbrush with a gentle whitening toothpaste formula. Today, I finally did it. I bought everything I needed. I brushed my teeth for the first time in months. I have no more plaque buildup. I set an Alarmy reminder twice a day to go take a picture of a bar code on my bathroom mirror so I remember to brush my teeth.

People don't understand what anxiety is,"People don't understand what the impact of an anxiety disorder really is.

I really wish i could explain just how it feels to have GAD. But i don't know how so i'm just going to write what we have to deal with which people never seem to understand.

Anxiety disorders do not mean we feel anxious once in a while, it means we have to actively work on ourselves every day to live a comfortable life.

We have to regulate our diet and cut out certain food ands drinks.

We have constant tight muscles and often develop injuries because of this, not only that but stress weakens the immune system.
There is many more health issues we have or can develop because anxiety isn't just mental, it often represents itself physically.

We are unable to work or go to school because the stress of sensory input is too much. 

We can't leave our house or do regular tasks that others consider to be normal. It's a learning progress for us and we need patience.

We can be stuck in anxiety spirals for months and have anxiety attacks so bad that we lose a lot of weight because we are unable to eat, sleep or function and have very bad symptoms like puking or fainting.

We can be triggered by any stressful event and lots of things hit way harder for us like physical pain.

I wish the medical world would put more focus on anxiety so we don't have to go to the ER 3 times in one week because our anxiety attacks are so bad we literally can't do anything.

Im so tired of the mistreatment of us and people not understanding, feeling like i can never be myself or feel ""normal"" again.

but then my (well-established) struggle with loneliness and rejection = lack of value and self-worth makes me really angry offended, then sad because I feel “god I must be so terrible, that’s why people would rather not communicate with me and instead communicate with others” 

Then I reach out or try to communicate my situation gently, (even asking honestly AITA). the response is more like “Hmm tbh I haven’t really been putting effort into doing things or seeing people. Not that I don’t ask to do things but... I just am not expecting to do anything maybe? Or expecting people to do things with me? And so, if people reach out to me, that’s cool. But if they don’t, I’m not reading into it.”

All of that sounds extremely healthy and understandable, so I repeat the cycle again. I can’t seem to feel normal in this world. It’s like dancing off beat all the time.

Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?,"I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. I'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few ""productive"" things I wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning HTML/CSS or working out). However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything. For example, I bought a course to learn Unity but the thought of not grasping the material and failing to deliver  something good-looking makes me too scared to even start the program",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/cc7boe/does_anyone_get_anxiety_from_feeling_like_youre/,anxiety

Today is my birthday. I am not big on birthdays, I don't like to celebrate it and in my opinion, this day has nothing to be celebrated about, being born was neither my choice nor my accomplishment.

Anyway, I woke up this morning at around 4 am, which is not my normal time of waking up, and I had this tight feeling in my stomach and this sinking feeling in my gut like something bad was gonna happen, I don't know how to describe it.
I am not new to this feeling, I have had it for years, before every flight I had to take, no matter what time of day, before any meeting early in the morning (even if it is a casual meeting where nothing is at stake), even so much as if I had planned to do anything in the morning, I would wake up with this weird engulfing feeling. It used to happen everyday a couple of years back, but now it's reduced to only when there is ""something"" happening..any something. 

I always thought this is my anxiety but today, it's nothing today, it's a birthday but I have absolutely nothing planned, I live with my parents and they couldn't care less about this day and I really don't want to think of this day as anything special.

"It's really hard to ""be strong and carry on"" when all I want to do is curl up in bed and go to sleep.","I feel so tired and anxious right now, and I have so much to do, both at work and at home. There is no time to ""be weak"" or fall apart, because there's too much to do and too many expectations that I feel like I have to keep carrying on. 

I have an amazing support system in my partner, who keeps me grounded and sane, but I've had a day that started in anxiety and continued in anxiety, and will undoubtedly end in anxiety. I don't want to be strong, do chores, make dinner, stay calm at work, be in a good mood when I get home. I just want to go home, crawl into bed, and cry.

More than anything, I want to live in a society where it's okay to be weak, it's okay to fall apart, it's okay to take time off of work, not because you're physically ill, but because you're mentally ill. Where bosses know how to support their employees who are mentally ill, and check in with them, and put structure around them that allows them to still continue on with work, but not feel scared they'll get fired if they keep calling out of work or have a bad day or react badly in a meeting because they're stressed out, overworked, overwhelmed.

I'm just tired and anxious and scared, and I want to be able to feel those things and know that the world will continue on. But I can't, I have to be strong and push it all down and ""carry on,"" so that the world doesn't fall apart, and it makes my anxiety all the worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/f1t9o0/its_really_hard_to_be_strong_and_carry_on_when/,anxiety

"Foodies who no longer have the energy - I'm writing a cookbook to help people who no longer have the motivation to cook through depression or other issues and instead resort mainly to things like fast food, may I ask what you like to see in it?","Hi everyone!

Please excuse me, I know this is a strange thing to talk about but I was recommended to pop it in here. Please remove it if it isn't allowed (and please excuse my gosh awful English!) !

For those who don't know me (which I'd imagine is everyone) I'm an ex-cook whose been dealing with depression on and off since I was 14.

Thanks to two very close friends I've been able to find ways around the lack of spoons to bring myself to cook again and I wanted to try and share the simple yet tasty recipes with people who share that same feeling.

Whilst it's a LONG way in development, I plan on it being a completely free release because it's only aim is to try and help people !

In the latest blog post there is a long(ish) list of things I will be adding, but I would love to know what kinds of recipes you guys would like to see simplified yet still just as tasty ! It can be anything, (even unhealthy ones as there is ways around it!) Vegan - Vegetarian - Meat feast or mixed!

I would also like to know if you believe this could actually be helpful. I have received some good feedback from those I pitched it to (although the website is not at all as far advanced as the book, I'm still working on that!) I would love to have a wider range of feedback than my own little circle !

A cool anxiety technique I learned,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible! 

Good luck and have a great week everyone, you got this!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/a0k03f/a_cool_anxiety_technique_i_learned/,anxiety

I considered pressing the emergency button and prying open the train door. Instead, I embraced the panic attack and pulled through.","I've suffered from a severe panic and anxiety disorder since i was 11. I'm 21 now, still suffering but going to a clinic soon to fix it. My worst fears are trains, busses, public places, small space and being surrounded by many people. I had an appointment at my new psychiatrist and i had to take the train, luckily it was only 2 stations away, 6 mins or so. So I got on the train and i felt surprisingly well. I actually felt great. Then the train suddenly stopped between 2 stations and i was stuck inside, no way out. Well one way out, pressing the emergency button and prying the door open which would have probably gotten me in a lot of trouble with the police. Panic hit me immediately after the the train stopped, i couldn't breathe and i felt like passing out any second. I got up and walked to the door and checked to see where the emergency button is. I actually considered pressing it. But the feeling of passing out completely overwhelmed me and i sat down on the floor and took deep breaths and tried to relax as best as i can. and guess what? It worked!! I survived the panic attack, i pulled through it and it feels f*cking amazing!! It gave me new hope and i actually believe that i'm able to overcome it. If you read everything, thank you!

She took me back to the X-Ray room, and instead of prepping me for it, she told me that she had anxiety also, and she was willing to let me sit for a while to calm down. We talked for a while, and she told me I was very strong. She told me that she knows the struggles of anxiety as well, and they are very real. She actually started crying a bit, and I asked if I could hug her, which she accepted.

"I have illness anxiety disorder, and failed to get my scheduled COVID-19 vaccine a few months ago. Yesterday I bit the bullet and got my first dose! Yayy!","I'm not an antivaxxer! I believe in modern medicine. 

I was always scared of getting the vaccine, because we don't know the long-term effects of it. And I was also scared of getting it with the medication combination I'm on for my bipolar disorder, because I didn't know how it could react. 

The first time I told myself I would get it if I stop taking my medications a week prior to clear it out of my system so I can get the vaccine all by itself. That was a huge mistake, because of my bipolar disorder I became very mentally unstable which also in turn exacerbated my anxiety. And so I failed to make the appointment. 

This time, I got the vaccine and ironically I wasn't on any medication at all because my doctor took me off one medication because of it not working, and also because I've been in a major depression the last two weeks I literally forgot to take the other of the two medications for a week straight. *yes!, really it's as simple as I forgot, I know it's bad*. 

So not only did I push through the anxiety of getting the vaccine, I also got what I wanted in that I got it without being on medication. *It wasn't on purpose I swear! Haha* 

My arm hurts like hell and I feel really lightheaded and dizzy today But otherwise I'm okay. 
However I am highly unstable, because I'm not on any medication and my doctor is gone for the next two weeks on vacation. Another psychiatrist at the clinic told me not to restart my meds until I see my psych. (after stopping lamotrigine for more than five consecutive days You can't just simply restart it, You have to retitrate up to the target dose again)

The pharmacist as well as the nurse at the vaccine site said it's okay for me to take my Ativan, a benzodiazepine, before and after getting the vaccine but I decided not to because I fear mixing it with the vaccine. 

So I am just pushing through the anxiety that the symptoms are giving me and I'm doing okay! 

But I'm super proud of myself for biting the bullet and getting the vaccine as I am much more scared of catching COVID-19 than I am of the vaccine.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/o3o6wb/i_have_illness_anxiety_disorder_and_failed_to_get/,anxiety
Don’t trust your anxiety! Today I got proof it isn’t always right.,"Today I had to do a big presentation at work to some important people. I was quite anxious as I’m still fairly new-ish to the job and still feel like a huge imposter. I’ve also got a new manager who sat in on the presentation to check everything went okay. 
I did it and when I came out the other side my anxiety was telling me it went terribly. Though I tried not to show it, throughout the presentation, the anxiety was saying, “oh god, you’re bombing, end it so the audience can stop feeling awkward and embarrassed for you.” I was sure that my manager must be quite disappointed. I fully expected to get a call from her to go over what went wrong and how to improve. 

Instead, she copied me in to an email between her and her boss giving me a “shout out” because I handled the tough questions “like a pro, giving extremely confident and good answers.” She also added that at the end, the head of department of the client I was presenting to had said the presentation was “one of the best” he’d seen and he’d found it “extremely useful and insightful”. 

I feel like she and I were at totally different presentations but it just goes to show, your anxiety is not always right about the situation and your perception does not always align with everyone else’s. 
Ignore the anxiety voice and just keep on going!

Being able to enjoy my hobbies, being able to go out in public without thoughts consuming me about the judgement of every stranger that walks by.

So I hospitalised myself,"I suffer from existential pure-o anxiety.

That means I obsessively ask a lot of deep questions about reality, and the inability to find conceivable answers causes me a great deal of paralysing anxiety.

Currently I'm obsessing about the nature of time. Did everything come into being at the, well, beginning? Has something always existed? Has that something existed in eternal time, or a timeless/changeless state until time/events began? What caused them to begin?

None of the possibilities even make sense to me, and that really disturbs me.

So I decided to go to a mental hospital. Being in the calm, orderly environment helps a bit, and the doctor is very empathetic and really tries to understand what's going on in my head.

She is trying out some medications to reduce the anxiety, and other types of therapy will also be available. Luckily I live in Europe so I don't have to pay for any of this. Though food is pretty shit. 😀

I am so proud of my wife,"My wife has extreme anxiety and when she does something that upsets me, that triggers it. It is super hard for me because I can never express myself in our relationship. 

Well tonight I was having a really hard day. I expressed it to her and she ignored me. She didn’t pick up on how hard my day was even though I expressed it very clearly. Later she could tell that I was even more sad and knew it had something to do with her. I didn’t want to go into detail because it would of set off a panic attack and I wouldn’t of been able to handle both my shit and her panic attack. I needed to take care of me tonight. 

So I tried to be as involved in our night as possible but let her lead and suggest what we did tonight. Obviously she could tell that my night was off and she started to become very distant. I got more upset at this because I wanted to be comforted. 

After a couple of hours she came out and said “ I know you need me tonight but I don’t know if I am strong enough.” She was talking behind a door and refused to come out. “But I just want to let you know that I love you and one day I will be able to comfort you.” 

After we kept talking she finally came out and I was able to open up and get the care and love that I needed. 

She didn’t have a panic attack. She did cry and almost went into it a couple of times but she was able to stay present and be what I needed in a partner tonight.

Ukraine Megathread,"Update 4/15: A group of people from this community have created r/UkraineAnxiety

Update 4/13: We have decided to formally close this thread to new comments. We feel that this thread is too taxing for us to moderate and is no longer worth the strain on our mod team like it was back when the situation was brand new. We want to thank everyone who has stuck around to help others stay level-headed through this whole mess!

Update 3/27: Due to all the feedback we got from updates 3/20 and 3/21, we have decided to relax the requirements for posting links. You are free to post a link you want help with or to add commentary on to help others understand it in a less anxious way, and now you can once again post links to good news as well as create good news collections (see the current stickied comment which includes some info on reassurance-seeking behavior). Our one requirement is that you should refrain from posting multiple times over a short period with good news links. If someone does this we will begin taking down their comments as spam. In this case it would be better to put together multiple news links and then post them as a single comment.

*~~Update 3/21: Please see the current stickied comment for more information. It is ok to include a link that is causing you anxiety and asking people to help explain it better. It is also ok to provide a news link alongside your own commentary about the article to help people understand what it is saying in a less anxious way. We're specifically going to remove comments that have one or more news links without asking for help or providing original commentary about the article.~~*

*~~Update 3/20: We have seen a large amount of posts that are mainly about sharing/discussing specific news articles. Please remember to keep everything relevant to anxiety. If a comment is just a news link then we have decided we will have to remove it to keep the thread on topic.~~*

Hi everyone,

It has been requested that we create a megathread for all of the events that have been happening with regards to the conflict in Ukraine. We decided that this is a good idea since so many people have been experiencing extreme anxiety because of it.

We have opted to have this thread be sorted by Best for the time being. To read and respond to the latest comments you can manually change the sort to New. The reason we’re doing this is because we want the most helpful and most grounded comments to float to the top to help as many people as possible keep their anxiety under control during this difficult time.

For those who want to talk with other anxiety sufferers in more of a live format, feel free to join our official Discord server with this invite link: [https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9](https://discord.com/invite/9sSCSe9). We have added a special channel to it called ""#ukrainediscussion"" so people can talk about what's happening and help each other.

As always please remember to be supportive and report any problematic comments so we can remove them as soon as possible.

Thanks!

Is it normal to feel physical symptoms of anxiety even if you are not mentally anxious about anything particular?,"I’ve been feeling the common physical symptoms of anxiety but I don’t know what’s causing it, and it’s been persistent for a week. 

I also have bad health anxiety so maybe focusing on it has been making me feel weird. I’m not sure. 

Does anyone else get random heat palpitations, the need to take big breaths and do breathing exercises, and also the feeling of not wanting to do anything? 

I contacted my doctor cause the heart palpitations and the need for breathing exercises usually happen at night.  
But I have to wait two weeks to have a 10 min phone call with my doctor. 

The only times I’ve ever felt this way were times when I was having such bad anxiety, but I don’t recall the heart palpitations. 

But like I said, I don’t have reasons to be THIS anxious.. unless I just don’t realize that I am actually this anxious.

I got a 4.0 this semester in college!," I don't ever like to post anywhere about my grades, but I got two A+s and two A's this semester in college, making it a 4.0 for the semester! 

I've been told by therapists before that it's at least 10 times harder for me to do any given assignment in school than most students as a result of my anxiety. I had some really hard tests and assignments this semester, a hell of a lot of panic and test-related nightmares, but I did it. 

I'm at a relatively difficult college and I even suffered through a horrible kidney stone that caused me to miss two weeks of class and cost me a trip to the emergency room. I also had chronic bronchitis that caused a couple doctor's visits as well. I genuinely don't have friends at college or groups I belong in. I have depression alongside this shit anxiety and I went through this all alone, away from any family or anyone that could help.

It may not be much, but I did it, and I made it through. And you guys can, too! 

Please never hesitate to get the support y'all need. If you can, reach out to get accomodations with your school and if you get sick, let teachers know! Get doctor's notes. Most professors are more understanding than you'd think.

Anyone else constantly have an upset stomach due to their anxiety?,"It’s a very specific kind of upset stomach that I get from my anxiety. It’s not a stomachache, or cramping, or “maybe I ate something bad”, it’s literally feeling sick with anxiety. I think out of all the anxiety symptoms I’ve experienced in my lifetime of anxiety, this is the absolute worst one and most likely the main symptom that will force me to attempt stupid therapy and medication again despite never having a good experience with either. 

I’ve already ruled many out other causes, and I know it’s likely only caused by my anxiety. I just don’t understand why my body and mind does this to itself. I can deal with shaky hands, or worried thoughts, or my heart racing, but feeling like your stomach is about to burst open and spill your guts everywhere makes literally EVERYTHING 1.000% harder, no matter how happy you are to do something. No matter how much you care, or how determined you are to have fun, it doesn’t change a thing. 

It makes social events uncomfortable, it makes work extremely hard to get through. It just makes me want to curl up into a ball in bed and never leave. I don’t even need any suggestions for how to fix this. I don’t need to be told that I need medication or therapy. I’m just so tired of constantly feeling sick and no one understanding why or how it feels. No, taking a tums isn’t going to fix it. No, I can’t just “stop worrying”, or drink some damn ginger tea.

"Wake up feeling fine until I ""remember"" to feel anxious... anyone else deal with this?","Hi all, 

Recently I've been dealing with a lot more latent anxiety than normal. I've struggled with it for years, but over the last few weeks there have been a lot of days where I've spent the entire time with a pit in my stomach. It's weird - I'll wake up feeling totally fine, then the moment I realize I'm not feeling any anxiety, it's like a switch flips and I just start accumulating it right then and there. What the hell is up with this? I'm not even having thoughts about anything specific while it builds up, it's just like I can't stop something that my brain has decided is normal. 

I think this started while I was having a rough time with a friend recently. That situation has since been resolved, but the pattern of this gnawing feeling has stayed.

"How being ""gifted"" led me toward anxiety and a feeling of stupidity","I was what one would call a ""gifted"" child throughout grade school. I got straight A's, took honors and AP classes, scored highly on standardized tests, even skipped a grade. I never studied for tests or struggled with homework, I just naturally retained all the information I was taught. I loved reading, I would read at least one book each week. I never procrastinated and genuinely enjoyed going to school.

All those years of performing so highly in grade school led to me and the people around me having very high expectations for my academic performance. Unfortunately for me, I found it harder and harder to meet those expectations throughout college. No matter how hard I try, I am completely unable to retain any information I learn, which frightens me because unlike grade school, this is information that will actually be pertinent to my future career. I end up procrastinating until the last minute to study or complete assignments because I am afraid of performing poorly. Whenever I try to read, it can't keep my attention. I recently took a standardized test, and I just performed ""below average to average"". All of those ""gifted"" attributes from my childhood just kind of... disappeared.

Now that I am graduating, I'm really scared for my future. I want to go into the sciences, it interests me and I care about it a lot... I'm just afraid that I'm not good enough. That I'm too stupid now. That I can't keep maintaining this image of high-performance and intelligence. I'm so afraid to try new things like research because I am afraid that I am going to fail and look stupid.

I feel like being raised as ""gifted"" has caused me to feel extremely anxious and stupid now that I am in the ""real world"". I'm curious if there is anyone else in this community that experienced a ""gifted"" childhood, or high childhood expectations, and now suffers from anxiety?

On my way out I guess I wasn’t paying enough attention and the same guy who picked me up, who was now playing the game...accidentally wacks my face.

Today though a group of three attractive girls were walking towards me. My eyes met with one of them, I held her gaze for a second or two and she gave me the biggest most beautiful smile! It really made my day and gave me a huge confidence boost.

It made me reconsider what is it that I'm being insecure about? I'm lacking confidence and I don't even know why. Amazing what a simple smile can do!

Does anyone else have intense fear that they’ll never be independent and have to rely on family members or have fears of being alone? Im scared to grow up.,"im 19 years old. I live with my family (my mum, my grandmother and my little brother). I dont have a job and i havent gone to college yet (put on hold since the pandemic). I have an intense fear of losing my family members and being left to look after my brother and myself on my own. I hate even writing this out because im scared ill “jinx” it and make it come true. I have dreams of my family members dying, i always push them to go to the doctors if they feel unwell, i try to encourage them to eat well and exercise. I understand its not my life its theirs, but this is all just coming from good intentions of keeping them well because i have such a fear of losing them. I even have nightmares of becoming homeless after they pass.

Its just hit me recently that im really growing up and going to start becoming independent. Get a job, go to college, move out, do my own shopping, pay my own bills, drive my own car, start a family. I cant even walk around my neighborhood on my own.. thats how bad this is. I cant pay in shops, i need to get my mum to because im too anxious. I dont even know if i know enough to keep me going on my own. I dont know how to pay bills, how to drive. I always rely on my family if i dont know anything or unsure how to do something. Im aware that i dont learn, i just get them to show me and i move on. I think a part of this is because if i learn all these things thats the first step towards becoming my own parent and that scares the living daylight out of me. I dont want it. I want to be a kid forever and have people surrounded by me and not feel alone. I want to be my own person yes, but i dont want to be *alone*. I dont know enough to be independent, i know i dont. Im soo anxious to get a job, to drive. Its the little things.. like i have to mind the house keys and the car keys, i have to pay the bills, i have to walk up and pay for my own shopping, i have to go to the bank. Being 27 and living with your parents still is known to be “bad” or “unhealthy”. Apparently it means you arent your own person. I dont believe this because my Mum has lived with her mum all her life and she’s independent, to an extent. I want to be my own person, but i cant be independent im so scared of going into the world on my own.

Does anyone have any advice on how to handle my anxiety and outlook on this?

My therapist told me I don't need further therapy sessions!,"I can't believe I am finally here.

The happiest news! After months of CBT, my therapist has finally told me that I no longer need further sessions for my anxiety.

I honestly wouldn't have been able to do it if it weren't for my therapist's strong and kind guidance, but she also told me to pat myself on the back for actively trying to help myself out of my situation. I went into therapy with a very strong desire to not let anxiety take over my life. I didn't hold back when telling my therapist about my anxiety attacks, every thought that bothered me, and the fears and worries that ate at my mind for hours and days on end. She was sympathetic and really helped me see through the lies my brain is telling me. 

I also did every homework, I took journaling to heart (and in the process found my new healthy hobby), I put in the work in trying out every cognitive restructuring exercise she suggested, from T charts to grounding techniques, really tried to determine which methods would work and which wouldn't, and also tried to get out more and connect with my friends and family.

And now after putting all that work, there is silence in my mind. The storm has passed and I now find myself in the calm I've long sought.

I am not *cured*, however; anxiety is part of the human condition and so cannot be completely eradicated. However, with the help of the techniques I've learned, I've been able to manage it enough for it not to bother me anymore.

There is help. There is light at the end of the tunnel. There is no harm in seeking help, and you deserve all the happiness in the world. I hope everyone in this sub finds peace.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/opsui7/my_therapist_told_me_i_dont_need_further_therapy/,anxiety
Anybody else have anxiety attacks over mundane situations but feel totally numb over more serious situations.,"Like right now I’m freaking out because my arm is in a little pain and I’m at a friends house, it’s 4:00 am and I’m cold and I don’t have a blanket but I don’t wanna wake anybody up by going out of the room to find one or wake them up directly to ask for one. I’ve been pacing back and forth in the same spot for an hour and a half, all because I’m a bit cold and my arm hurts. Same thing happened when I spilled juice on a table at school. I started hyperventilating over spilled juice. And in slightly more serious situations, I feel totally numb and i disassociate. It’s like I’m not there and my life isn’t real. I had to confront my professor about a paper I didn’t turn in yet and when I was about to talk to him, I started to feel lightheaded, my vision stated closing in, my emotions disappeared and I started to disassociate. 

I’m sorry for this somewhat long rant/DAE question that probably doesn’t even make sense. I just hate myself for being like this and I just wanted to get me feelings out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/btle96/anybody_else_have_anxiety_attacks_over_mundane/,anxiety
Does anyone else miss quarantine?,"Listen I know it’s controversial. Like many others, I lost my job, I was struggling financially, but the feeling of not having to commit to anything, wake up whenever I want, stay up until late hours, not have to socialize with anyone; I found it so relaxing in a very stressful way. I was scared shitless for the majority of it, I showered and lysol-ed my entire apartment after going to the grocery store. I had a small savings and was able to support myself which I know is not the case for a lot of people, so I do feel bad saying this, but I kind of wish we could have another lock down just so I could feel this sense of freedom again. Am I alone in this feeling?


*edit! I did not expect this to blow up as it did. I feel terrible for those who got more anxiety from staying home, I can completely understand where you’re coming from if you were in a bad situation. I lived alone at the time with my cat which was a blessing. I know many people didn’t have the means to relax as I did. And finally, I commend those of you had to work essential jobs during this time and I do not mean to denote that whatsoever. I just loved the feeling of waking up to another day of absolutely nothing on the table. No meetings with friends that I agreed to a week ago that I’m regretting now, no leaving the house unless necessary, no driving into work, just a state of pure nothingness that helped me heal in a way I never thought it would.

I'd rather die than feel like this,"School started today and I woke up with my heart beating like crazy. I could feel and hear the blood in my brain. Then I ate breakfast- threw it all up. On every break I had to go to the toilet (nausea, sorry if that's gross :/). I finished school- went to the shop with my mum. My heart was still beating very heavily and I felt dizzy. Additionally I got lost without a phone. The shop was huge and I was looking on the right and then to the left trying to spot my mom in the huge crowd of people. With every move of my head I felt more and more dizzy. I thought I was gonna either burst out crying or pass out. I didn't luckily. Just imagine, 17 years old man crying because he got lost in the shop- pathetic, but I was in such a bad state this day that it was really hard to keep myself at least a little bit rational. Well, I found her (yay :,)) I got back home but I am in such a bad state that I am not able to eat anything. I've tried but I feel like throwing up and my heart is still so loud. What shall I do?

"I was inches from committing suicide 6 months ago, today I signed a lease for the nicest apartments in my city. Hang in there.","Long story short, over the summer I was planning on driving my car over the edge of a cliff after I dropped some people off on vacation. I was overwhelmed in life and saw no way out aside from ending it all. Felt like a disappointment because I dropped out of college, worked as a personal trainer at a gym where I was taken advantage of and forced to work 16-17 hour days for pennies. Lived in some slummy apartments with no AC and barely had any grocery money. I usually bummed pizza from local Pizza shops at the end of the night when someone hadn’t picked up a carry out order. Sometimes I’d get something, sometimes I’d get told to fuck off. Got on average 3 hours of sleep aside from Saturday nights. Mental health was at an all time low.

I made some changes that started with therapy. After that, I got a lucrative new sales job, love the people I work with, practice Muay Thai weekly, work out every day, and am in a much better place mentally. 

If you think this post is about me rooting my own horn... You’re right. I’m damn proud of the progress I’ve made. Whatever it is you’re going through, keep fighting. Keep waking up every day.

I Survived a Genocide But I Feel Nothing,"I managed to evacuate from Gaza, leaving behind the rubble, the bodies, and the memories of the war zone. You’d think getting out would bring relief, a sense of safety—but all it brought me was emptiness. I thought once I escaped, I’d be able to feel again, to grieve for the lives lost, for the people I knew. But I feel nothing.

I’m in a place far from the violence now, surrounded by people who are living normal lives. They go about their day, complaining about trivial things—traffic, their jobs, relationship problems. And I just stare at them. How do they not realize how absurd it all is? I survived hell, saw children torn apart in the streets, watched families disappear overnight, and now I’m expected to care about small talk? I don’t.

Even after I got out, people wanted me to share my story, to talk about the horrors I escaped. But every time I do, I feel detached, like I’m telling someone else’s story. I describe the destruction, the bodies, the screams, but it feels like I’m reading from a script. I can’tonnect to it anymore. It’s like I left my emotions back there, buried under the rubble.

I’ve lost all sense of empathy. When I hear about someone dying, even someone close, it doesn’t register. I didn’t cry when I found out a friend of mine didn’t make it out. I didn’t care when I heard about others losing everything. I go through the motions, pretending to sympathize, but inside, it’s just blank.

People think escaping the genocide means survival, but it’s not true. Part of me died there, and the part that made me human never made it out. Now, when I see images of what’s still happening, or hear about others’ struggles, I can’t bring myself to feel anything. I walk past people begging for help, and I feel no urge to stop.

I’m broken in ways no one can see. On the outside, I’m functioning. I smile, I work, I talk to people. But inside, I’m just as destroyed as the streets I left behind.

Depression does NOT mean feeling sad. Depression is a medical term for functioning below necessary levels,"Depression, and it’s synonym suppression are commonly used in medical treatment and diagnosis to indicate something is wrong and the affected system can’t adequately contribute to the rest of the body. So basically you can’t think and act in a way that keeps up with your obligations. So it’s not just feeling sadness. It’s not laziness, and it’s not for the sake of gaining attention.

Should I just keep it in therapy? I can always delete this account.  I just wanted to hear different points of view. I swear I just want to d!3 than go file paperwork.  I wished I knew this wasn't normal.  I'm so fucking lost 😞  . I know people are asking why didn't I speak up? It's cause I thought this was normal in any relationship.

My daughter is scaring me tonight. No idea how to help.,"My daughter (10) very suddenly this evening said she feels like she's in a dream/ like she's not real/ like she's a ghost.

I had her take a shower, brushed her hair and she put on her jammies. Tucked her bed with beach sounds and told her to relax and picture being at the beach. Walked in a couple of minutes later and she's crying.

I think that “13 reasons why” is a very bad way of “spreading awareness”,"As the title suggests, I think that 13RW is a very bad portrayal of mental health, suicide, depression etc. and it shouldn’t be promoted as a show that “raises awareness”, when it’s just harmful. It portrays suicide as something “beautiful” and “meaningful” and not what it really is. And the whole “blame it on other people even though they tried to help me” thing? Nope nope nope, that’s so toxic. Idk if I just feel that way because of my PTSD (an older guy blamed me for his suicide attempt because I didn’t “help him enough” even though I did everything I could and was only 13), but it’s just not really how suicide should be portrayed, in my opinion. Also, the way they show flashbacks of Hannah Baker from when she was alive makes it seem like she’s still alive in some way. They reeeeally push this harmful “suicide is something you choose as a weapon to hurt other people” agenda, when in reality, suicide is often the exact opposite. 
Idk, personally I really don’t like that show, and i think it’s harmful. I once opened up about my suicidal thoughts and depression to a friend, and she was all like “who made you feel that way?” like it was other people’s fault. Like sure, trauma and toxic relationships with people can worsen suicidal thoughts and depression but I just don’t feel like the show portrayed it in a helpful way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ge1dz0/i_think_that_13_reasons_why_is_a_very_bad_way_of/,mentalhealth

My boyfriend undressed me without asking. It’s not what you think though.,"I am usually the most positive, motivated, & outgoing person ever, but with COVID-19 affecting every aspect of my life, it wasn’t a surprise I became deeply depressed. I had been trapped in my apartment for months with no job, money, or motivation. My mentality started shifting to something more cynical as well. One night in particular though, my boyfriend helped catalyze me getting better. It was insanely difficult to get out of bed. Sure I’d get up maybe for an occasional snack or a quick bathroom break but I was just stuck mentally and physically, and in this case I hadn’t left my mattress for days. I wasn’t okay at all. Then one day out of the blue, my boyfriend went into my closet and grabbed me one of his t- shirts, (my) underwear, and (my) shorts. He propped me up and undressed, then dressed me while my eyes swelled up. He didn’t even ask. He just did it. Every time I think about that moment I tear up because it was the most intimate and sweetest thing anyone has ever done for me. I really am so lucky to have such a caring man in my life. I can’t wait to marry him some day. Our relationship is him doing the most selfless acts of love for me, and even though he might not think much of his actions, they mean the world to me.

"Just had my cousin's memorial on Zoom, and it was atrocious.","My cousin recently killed herself. We were close when we were growing up. Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. 

I'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she ""succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19"" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to ""heaven"" and not ""hell"" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed ""sin"". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.

I posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying ""Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not."" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. 

They fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. 

I'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the ""eyes of God"". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.

I feel so bad for her. If her parents made \*me\* feel this invalidated in one fell swoop, I can't imagine what her life was like with them.

I guess I have mental health issues but im not in therapy at the moment, the current situation put that a bit on the back burner. But in the past I hated myself and attempted to end my life on a handfull of occasions, getting always closer to breaking and doing it.

Maybe three month ago I was approched by a social worker and he helped me find my way to a home for young men in rough situations in just a couple of weeks. It is still hard to belive how easy that was. For about a month and a half I just kinda houng out and got acclimated but kept some of my old habbits up (not drugs, just kinda being aimless).

My cat stopped me from committing suicide.,"Today something very weird happened. I began to have very suicidal thoughts, but my cat stepped in. You may think i’m making this up but i’m not i swear.
Tonight I held a knife to myself, and my cat ran to my side. At first I thought he was just trying to cuddle or get me to pet him, but I then noticed instead of rubbing into my hand, he was pushing the knife away. I broke down into tears and he immediately climbed into my lap. I moved and he laid beside me, and now refuses to let me out of his sight. His little paw is sitting on my arm, and when i move he moves. This is insane, but he stopped it, if it wasn’t for my cat i’d be dead. I can’t thank him enough, he’s my angel baby. I love him so much.

Update: I’m better, I decided to stay for him. Mentally I’m not okay, but I’m working on myself and I will get better soon. Thank you all for the love and support! Ive been getting more love from strangers than I get from friends and family. It means the world to me.❤️

My mom broke up with me for Donald Trump,"About a week ago, my mom told me she wasn't interested in corresponding any further after Trump lost. I'm a gay trans person so I obviously voted Biden.

It really sucks that my mom has abandoned me for a cult.


EDIT: Thank you to all the kind and supportive people. This really hurts, but your empathy is a comfort.

To the folks that think I'm exaggerating or leaving something out, I implore you to drive to a small town, then take in the Trump bumper stickers on every car and Trump banners beside every house. I've driven by multiple Biden road signs with bullet holes in them out in the middle of nowhere. 

I have been trying to get my parents to stop berating me with Trump news for more than four years now. They have ruined dinners out, caused friction in relationships, and generally made my life stressful since the day he decided to run for office by talking about him constantly, aggressively, and refusing to listen to what anyone else has to say. This is not on me or for lack of trying to understand their POV.

I really don't think I'm exaggerating or being rude to state that this is cult-like behavior. A cult is literally defined as ""a system of religious veneration and devotion directed toward a particular figure or object."" This definitely fits the bill for a lot of small town Americans.

Does anyone else get angry about how much effort you have to put in to stay stable?,"I woke up exhausted, feeling like sand was holding me down. 

But I knew the sand wasn’t real. I was capable of being a function human, so I decided to be one. I got out of bed, showered and brushed my teeth, I put on clothes and left the house briefly to shop. And then I binge ate crap food, drank vodka, watched 10 hours of tv whilst taking lots of pain meds for back trouble. 

I’m not really sure what I’m trying to say. I guess I want people to know that I tried. I fought back at my body and forced myself up, forced myself to do the bare minimum of existing and damnit - I was so proud. I want the satisfaction of ‘doing the healthy thing’ even though it was hard, and then I want the reward to be a sudden ability to live easily. 

But it didn’t come. I gave in to the dull ache of sadness and consumed sugar, salt and digital crap until I felt sick. I’m back in bed now thinking about every mistake I made today and how I wish I was stronger. 

I know that a path back to a healthy mental space/ lifestyle is going to be a long, hard road after neglecting it for so long. And I know I have to do it, and do it now before it deteriorates further. I just wish it wasn’t so intensely challenging. I wish that I didn’t have to eat healthily, exercise, keep a tidy house, be social JUST TO STAY AFLOAT.

Missing a run means missing on the happy endorphins I rely on to keep me going through the day. Having an unhealthy meal makes me sluggish, that in turn makes me feel that tiny bit worse which is enough to make me not do chores. I hate being in such a fragile state where i’m not quite mega-depressed, just always on the verge of not leaving my bed for 48 hours.

I was a 16 years old male with Bulimia Nervosa, I opened up here about my issues and alot of you good folks helped me. 

A random user reached out to me and started helping out, by giving me advice and opened up to me about her own problems. She gave me a place to vent and someone to reach out to. 

Now I haven't been bulimic for the last 2 years (20 now), I did it solely from education and will which I'm proud of, because proper therapy is not accessible here. I started exercising, and educated myself alot about nutrition and physical health, I sometimes relapse, but very rarely (once a day every couple of months or so). And she definetly helped me alot. And I want to thank her, and talk to her. Oh Boi do I have alot of stories to tell her about (unfortunately not all are good). 

She is a married middle aged woman with kids, she is Pyromaniac, would talk to me about it and  about her daily routine of how she handles it.

then climb a hill instead 

if the morning brings you sadness

if the day ahead weighs heavy 

and your plans feel like a curse

don’t make yourself feel worse 

if a shower stings like needles 

and a bath feels like you’ll drown 

if you haven’t washed your hair for days 

don’t throw away your crown 

a day is not a lifetime 

a rest is not defeat 

don’t think of it as failure 

just a quiet, kind retreat 

it’s ok to take a moment 

from an anxious, fractured mind 

the world will not stop turning  

while you get realigned 

the mountain will still be there

you can climb it in your own time

Adopted a cat during quarantine and it is unbelievable how our bond together has helped ease the pains of isolation.,"So long story short, a couple months ago I was losing my mind feeling trapped inside my apartment with very little to do. Like many of you, probably. It was just me and my roommate going about our usual routine, and life just seemed so... bleak. Then my friend asked if I could babysit his kitten and it was a game changer. I found out cuddling, nuzzling, feeding and caring for a cat was so rewarding and realized how special the bond between cats and humans are. So I adopted my own kitten a few weeks later, and we fell instantly in love with each other. I have so much time to appreciate the little moments between us, to watch him grow, and to witness our bond grow stronger everyday because we spend so much time together. Not only that, but I feel more confident in reaching out to my friends and family on social media/phone again because I don’t feel alone anymore. I would say if you are feeling alone or you are looking for a sense of purpose during this time, I highly recommend getting a pet, because this is a rare occasion where your bond with your pet will be stronger than ever. If you want to follow my cat on IG, I post almost every day and you can watch him grow too. @finn_the_feline_._._

CW: Suicide. I almost took my life. Twice. Therapy saved me. But my therapist didn’t. Here’s what I mean.,"TL;DR please seek help if you are struggling, if you’re unhappy, or even if you’re happy and want to stay that way. There is a light. 

3 years ago, my family home was foreclosed on. 2 years ago my mom had a stroke and was paralyzed and left unable to speak. 3 months ago she passed away after a long battle. I haven’t been able to speak to my best friend for 2 years and now I’ll never be able to. 

Within that time, I had two suicide attempts. I was on pills. I was drinking alone everyday. I was hospitalized. I was uninsured. I was homeless. I thought I was beyond repair. 

For two years now since then, I’ve been in therapy. Every week for two years. 

Now, I’m engaged. An awesome step son. I have a good job. A nice place to live. I’m excited for the future. 

Therapy saved me. But not my therapist. 

My therapist is amazing. He’s smart. Insightful. Knows when to listen. But when I started therapy, I thought my therapist would just tell me what to do. I’d do it. And I’d be fixed. 

That’s not how it worked for me. 

A lot of my friends who aren’t in therapy have been afraid to, or too stubborn to go seek help. 

They think they know better than a professional. BUT HERES THE RUB: My therapist didn’t know how to fix me. 

I did. 

(For me personally) therapy has been about bringing out repressed thoughts and feelings. Things I couldn’t talk to my friends about. Couldn’t talk about with my family.

Therapy also made me take accountability. For all my mistakes, the people I’ve wronged.

I can now accept my past and look to the future. A future I wanted to take away from myself. 

I hope if even one person reads this and feels inclined to help themselves. Because you can. 

P.S. I’m new to Reddit. And I like it a lot. I’ve already made friends. If you need a friend, I’m here!",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/l9ghgu/cw_suicide_i_almost_took_my_life_twice_therapy/,mentalhealth

Suicide hotlines are useless for people struggling with mental illness,"As somebody who has called a suicide hotline at least 6 times in the past, none of the operators were helpful. At that point, I gave up calling those hotlines. These people are not trained mental health professionals so they don't really know what to say. They are just trained to listen and answer with ""I'm sorry you are going through that"" and ""Do you think there's anything you could do to lessen those thoughts""? and ""It must be so hard for you"" and ""Do you have a plan?"". It's literally the same phrases every time. It's like they are a bunch of robots. So goddamn repetitive and predictable. If I wanted to hear those phrases over and over, I could literally type them into Siri or something. Basically, they just want to offer you some sympathy.

And also HOW IS KNOWING THAT OTHER PEOPLE FEEL LIKE SHIT TO SUPPOSED TO HELP THAT JUST UPSET ME EVEN MORE. I get knowing that I am not alone helps but if half the people in my school are depressed there might just be a problem with the school.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who responded I have a psychiatrist/therapist now (I don’t really know the difference since English isn’t my native language). I would like to say that I am not from the USA I’m from Belgium still thanks for your advice because a lot of it still applies here and they might have helped someone from the USA.

"As a rape survivor, I want to let you know that things will get better! Maybe not now, maybe not immediately but they eventually will! Don’t give up!","Although I myself still struggle after being raped nearly 2 and a half years ago (and the rape will impact me my whole life) I want to let you know that time really heals wounds.

After, I got raped it was the worst time in my life. There are no words to describe how horrible it was. From a person who was very confident, lived in multiple countries, travelled the world I was afraid to go to my local grocery shop. I nearly had a panic attack when I was alone with a man in a shopping aisle. I had to postpone all my exams, my academic and social life suffered immensely. I had PTSD, anxiety, depression etc. I had very dark thoughts. I considered taking a year out of university because just getting out of bed was a struggle for me. I could write a book about all the negative effects of rape.

But now I honestly feel so much better. Of course, I still suffer the effects. But compared to the past I have made great progress. I am planning to continue my therapy though as I feel like my healing process is not over.

But I want to let you know that things will get better. I have graduated from top 30 university in the world with a prestigious degree, last year I was a committee member of multiple societies at my university. I am looking forward to life.

One thing I would tell you is that don’t put a timeline or deadline for your recovery. And don't compare yourself to others. I used to wonder will I ever get better. Why I am not getting better already? Why is it taking so long? Don’t compare your recovery to someone else. Although I will recover the whole of my life, what I mean is that If you are not getting better/progressing in a certain period of time is okay.

Everyone is different and take as much time you need to heal.

For me, it was also hard to see all my friends enjoying life and this tragedy happening to me. But now I am slowly accepting that life didn’t turn out exactly the way I wanted. And bad things happened to good people.

I am posting this because I felt much better myself reading stories of rape victims that persevered and ‘overcame’ their trauma.

I am wishing you nothing but the best. And please don’t give up. Life is beautiful, even if it does not see this way now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/junrt7/as_a_rape_survivor_i_want_to_let_you_know_that/,mentalhealth

Tik Tok psychologists are the absolute worst,"I absolutely hate the so-called ""psychologists"" on tik tok and instagram. They often take general things that could apply to almost anyone and try to claim they're a result of mental illness. They'll title a video something like ""10 signs you might have bipolar"" and then list things like ""You like to hang out with friends sometimes, but others you prefer to spend time to yourself"", or ""Its hard for you to stay focused on just one hobby"". Plus, they have a bad habit of labelling EVERYTHING as a ""trauma response"". You're a picky eater? Trauma. You get nervous around crowds? Trauma. Theyll even say that PRETENDING to have trauma is a sign of trauma. It seriously pisses me off, because what they're doing is causing great harm to those who actually struggle with mental health. It delegitimizes the experiences of those with mental illness, and it makes a lot of people assume that mental illness' aren't actually too big a struggle to have.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/tqk4gp/tik_tok_psychologists_are_the_absolute_worst/,mentalhealth

"I Am Thoroughly Disgusted By The Portrayal of Mental Health in 13 Reasons Why Season 4, And Disturbed By the Amount of People Defending It.","13 Reasons Why has always been controversial from the start. I understand where people come from when they say the first season glorified suicide. Personally, I believe the first season had good intentions, and truly was trying to raise awareness for suicide.

Of course, they completely sabotaged Hannah Baker’s character in S2, which had a detrimental effect on the message.

But Season 4 - oh, it makes my blood boil. Clay’s undiagnosed, undefined “mental illness” - at best described by the show as “trauma” - is used as an excuse for outrageously bad behavior. By bad behavior, I mean locking his friends in a cabin in the woods and clanging an axe against the door. I mean vandalizing his school and burning his principal’s car. I mean waving a gun around in front of the entire student body.

And worst of all, when he finds out his adoptive brother is dying, his immediate response is to run to the police station and yell, “I’ve got a gun!” Why? Because he needed people “to see how broken he was.”

This one really hit me close to home. When I was 6, my infant sister had to spend all 4.5 months of her life on a ventilator in the hospital. When she died - near Christmas time - I did not go terrorize people so that they could see “how broken I was.”

Yet [few people](https://youtu.be/ynewf90xWZc) see it that way. When I say this, 13 RW fans tell me “Well, you were 6. Your emotions were not as deep as our beloved FICTIONAL character Clay.”

I hate what that show became, and the perverse effect it has.

My mother having sex with me in the same room damaged my relationship with sex,"When I was about 10 years old my parents split up and my mom got with her current boyfriend. Ever since I could remember I would hear them having sex at night while they thought I was sleeping. We went through a lot of houses in the time this happened. I'm currently 17 and the first time I recall hearing her doing this was when we lived with my aunt shortly after my parents broke up and I shared a room with my mom. She would almost every night have sex and I would have to sit there for what felt like hours covering my ears. Then we eventually started living in a camper and it would happen so much the whole camper would shake and all I would hear was the noises. Now we live in a house, and at least we have our own rooms but I still hear them because the walls are so thin and they leave the door open. I bring this up because I cannot and never have been able to have a healthy sexual relationship with myself without thinking of them having sex. The noises and the shaking. I just wanted to tell this on here because this is the only way I feel like I can anonymously say it and I just want some help because it still happens to this day and I just wonder if it's trauma or if I'm just being overly dramatic.

I was in shock and in. i laughed maybe it was a weird joke but he looked at me and said"" f you its not funny"".
 the pain turned into anger and i wanted to bash him but i kept quiet and under control, he didn't seem very stable(who am i to judge though) i got up and walked like 40 meters even more far from him and this guy gets up starts yelling to himself ""this f****ing guy why isn't he leaving!"" i got really uncomfortable so got up gave him a peace sighn with my hand and he replied of course with ""f you"" all this with tears of past pain falling down on my face all i wanted was a hug and got this left with tears and had to fight a breakdown for about a 15 min walk until i reached a safe spot.

Broke down during my night shift in the ER tonight,"I'm a nurse working on the front lines in a children's emergency department in Canada. I'm a very positive person and have been keeping high spirits throughout this, but today really broke me.

Today is my 24th birthday. I normally live at home with my family but I've had to move out for their safety. I haven't seen any family or friends in 2 months now.

I rang in my 24th today in a room with a baby suspected for COVID-19 who was very sick. I was holding the baby while the doctor was doing a lumbar puncture. Wearing the same mask I've been wearing all day and full gown, face shields, gloves.

I could feel my phone vibrating with messages from friends/family. I'm not even an emotional person but I just started crying silently. Everyone was so concentrated that no one noticed. I went to the back after and spent 20 mins having a good cry while listening to the stable song from BOTW (LOL).

I wasn't sad about working on my birthday, having to wear sweaty PPE all day or even having to deal with a sick baby (I deal with them all the time). I think I was just so overwhelmed the last few weeks and this was the first time I let my emotions out.

Thanks for reading this. Hope everyone is staying safe.

I feel bad for my cat because we don’t have a routine anymore.,"When I had a predictable schedule, my cat would make sure I followed it to the letter every morning.

He woke me up right before my alarm so there was time for me to pet him. Then would hop off and meow until I got out of bed. Then led me to the bathroom, and would wait on top of the toilet until I was done showering. If I took longer than ten minutes he’d start meowing. Then he’d sit on top of my counter and watch me brush my teeth, and try to grab the floss as I was using it. Then he would hop down and strut in front of me, looking behind to make sure I was following, and lead me to my bag. Once I picked up my bag, he’d lead me downstairs to the kitchen. He would then sit on one of the chairs and watch me cook and eat breakfast, and when I was getting all ready to leave, he would wait for me to walk over and pet him goodbye for the day.

When I got home, he’d be waiting for me. He’d lead me back upstairs and stand in the spot my bag’s supposed to go. Then we’d play fetch with toy balls and I’d give him lots of pets until we tired out. Then I would get on the computer for work and games, and he’d hop into his cat bed nearby and fall asleep. When it was time for bed, he sometimes even got up to lead me to the bathroom and make sure I was brushing my teeth, then go back to bed.

Since the pandemic started, I’ve had nowhere to go. Nothing to do. And even several months later, I can tell he misses the routine. He still tries to wake me up on time. He’s been trying different tactics. The most effective one so far seems to be bringing a toy and doing cuddle rolls just out of reach of the bed so I have to get up to pet him. He still meows if I’m in the shower for more than ten minutes. When I do finally go downstairs, he rushes ahead of me halfway down and leads me the rest of the way. He frequently makes circles around my feet as I’m on the computer, asking for pets and playtime. It breaks me heart when he does these things. I know he’s trying so hard.

Literally the most caring individual when it comes to me taking care of myself is my cat. But lot of his effort goes in vain, and it wracks me with guilt and appreciation every morning to watch him try.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/iq3f0c/i_feel_bad_for_my_cat_because_we_dont_have_a/,mentalhealth
Some random guy saved my life today and he didn’t even realize it,"So I hit rock bottom months ago, but I brought a shovel with me and I’ve been getting worse and worse. I wrote my suicide note this morning and my plan was to take my pistol and end it all tonight when I got home from work. I had everything planned and I was set. Then this evening I was at work delivering pizzas. I went to this one house and I wasn’t sure if I was at the right address or not but there was a man in the driveway and I asked him if I was at the right address. He said he wasn’t sure because it was his bosses house, not his, and he was only there to pick up his car. Then we started talking and he mentioned how I was smiling. He spoke about how he was 63 years old, he was a military veteran, and how with people my age he doesn’t see people smile like I did. It was a fake smile I put on so when I greet customers it’s a good experience. But he picked up on my smile, we chatted and he was making me laugh, he ended up giving me a big hug and was telling me how I should appreciate my friends, my family, and life. This guy had no clue I was depressed and suicidal and was planning on taking my life 3 hours later, yet he still told me all of this. He ended up giving me some cheese he had (I didn’t eat it) but the reason why he gave it to me is because  the packaging had a huge smile on it and he told me to have it and to keep on smiling and spreading positivity. 

This guy was only at the house to pick up his car, he was only there for 5 minutes, yet in that 5 minutes is when I showed up. If that delivery was 5 minutes earlier or 5 minutes later I would have already taken my life, but the timing was perfect, and I’m still here. I’m not a super religious person, but I truly believe this man was my saving grace, he was sent by god to let me know it’s not my time to go. I gotta keep fighting. 

I got his bosses phone number from the side of the work truck that was sitting in the driveway and I plan on calling him tomorrow and letting him know this story and asking him to thank his employee for me.

i just wanted some support because it’s still hard not to resort to unhealthy coping skills for me. my therapist doesn’t know the extent of my self harm because even after seeing her for over a year, i get scared and anxious about telling her stuff sometimes (i’m working really hard on it). thanks for reading & i hope everyone has a wonderful life filled with healing :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hyz0ov/im_2_days_clean_from_self_harm/,mentalhealth

I don't want to give details, but it was disgusting and of a sexualized nature. Just extremely vile shit. I began having a panic attack and I vomited.

But I can't help it, because I'm too scared to pull them in with me. I know that they might get tired of me always being such a downer and constantly feeling like this. I haven't even replied to my boyfriend in days and I think I've also triggered him because I keep seeing him post sad depressing stuff online. 

I've been feeling the need to isolate even more because the of many problems and the quarantine isn't making it any better.

I hate that I feel this way and always thinking that isolation is the key.

"Just because some people don't make a scene of their mental disorders, doesn't mean they aren't struggling","Just because some people don't look or act mentally ill, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem going on. If they are trying hard to hide it, it's possible they're struggling more since they have to hold it in. Also, if someones symptoms don't seem as severe as your own, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem and therefore aren't entitled to get help. Kids shouldn't need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it's a real problem that they deal with. And they definitely shouldn't have to go as far as to commit suicide to show they've struggled.

&#x200B;

I want people to get help without being told their OCD is for attention, and that their depression is just an excuse to be lazy, their anxiety is just an excuse to avoid doing things, or their ADHD is just an excuse to misbehave. If people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity, then maybe don't give them pity and that's the problem solved then? Instead of giving them the things you think they're faking problems to get, try to push them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them.

&#x200B;

Nobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder, I get that. If someone you know is doing that, treat it like the law does: don't punish or hate them, but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can't control themselves.

&#x200B;

If anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they're afraid of being called an attention seeker, don't hold back because of people like this. Know that bottling it up will make it worse over time. Tell someone that will understand (maybe a school psychologist or a doctor) before it becomes too severe to fix easily. Once you do that, it will be so much easier.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/abepgb/just_because_some_people_dont_make_a_scene_of/,mentalhealth
This sub is toxic…,"Sorry to say this, but the amount of “I’m going to kill myself” or “I’m going to self harm myself over *insert phrase*” is too much. This sub is for ranting and asking for help. People who need that help I feel should be welcomed and helped out. But if someone is actually to the point where they might end their life and they are looking for help, and all they see is people talking about killing themselves or self harming, that will only make it worse for them. I found this sub to maybe rant or get advice on how to better myself but a majority of the posts I’ve seen are just people saying they are going to end it or asking how they should do it. No disrespect to anyone who has made these posts, but I feel like this is anti what this sub is for. I feel like mods should consider this as well and I think it would make it better for those needing real advice.

I learned an important lesson from my therapist about healing.,"At the end of our hour, she told me that although I’ve been hurt and broken badly, she can see I still have parts that aren’t shattered. 

I laughed lightly and I said “Yeah, one day that will be all of me, no parts shattered anymore”,

And she said “No, it won’t.”

And, for a second, I felt my heart break - but she continued.

“But it will be the most dominant part of you. Think of your body - if you break your shoulder, even after it heals it will be tender. It will be a sore spot. You will be careful with it. There will be a gentleness when you care for it. If you crack a rib, laughing will hurt and, even after there is no longer a fracture, you may laugh lighter *just in case.* You can heal, but it is okay to be aware of the parts of you that once hurt the most. The most important thing to know is that where there is tenderness, let there be gentleness.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/aum1eu/i_learned_an_important_lesson_from_my_therapist/,mentalhealth

Is depression actually just a heightened awareness of the pointlessness of life?,"Something that often comes to mind.

It's common for a lot of people suffering with depression to feel that life is pointless and a waste of time. When I think about it, the only logical purpose to our existence is to procreate; which arguably could be seen as pointless, as it's ultimately unfulfillable. This train of thought always leads me to the same answer; which is that my depression isn't caused by some sort of chemical imbalance, or poor circumstances, but the understanding that my life is in fact pointless.

You don't need to have a crazy story to be valid,"I have had an insane life full of dark trauma, abuse, alcoholism, suicide, despair, extreme loss, stalking, harassment, and destitution. For years I wanted to die and I begged my mother for permission to die to end my suffering. I literally got my brain zapped 14 times to fight it (ECT is actually very safe and effective for severe treatment resistant depression). But all those labels don't matter.

So let me tell you a few things: 

1. Your suffering is as equally valid as mine. 
2. Everything is relative. You can have an amazing life and still be suffering.
3. Your suffering does not need justification. You feel what you feel. Screw invalidating statements like ""It's just hormones"".
4. We all have our own journey don't compare your life/struggles to those of others.
5. You deserve growth as a human being even if you don't feel like you do. Our illnesses cloud our perspective of the past, present, and future.
6. Don't believe everything you think.
7. There is no ""cure"". Suffering is part of human existence and by learning to accept it and sit with it we can overcome it.

Would someone take the time to wish me a happy birthday? I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today.,"Today is my birthday and this sounds pretty sad, but I just want someone to wish me a happy birthday and maybe say something nice. I no longer have any friends or family left and just want some sort of human connection, even if it is just over Reddit, to make me feel just a bit less isolated and forgotten.

I have just endured so much lately and I don't have anyone to talk to or confide in, but I thought I could make it through today just fine. I was wrong. I feel stupid and pitiful while I'm typing this, but I just want to know someone is out there and understands.Getting to this point happened without me even realizing how solitary I had become until I was completely alone. I might as well lay it out, as just the act of typing it might be some sort of catharsis.

So how did I end up here? I started typing out damn near my whole life story, but that made this post so long that if I left it included there was an even smaller chance someone would read this. So highlights then? Abandoned by parents, raised by grandparents, abused by neighbor from ages 5 to 8, horrible abandonment issues, started getting into drugs, dropped out of high school, got a GED, some life happened, was totally Goth, some more life happened, made some music and art, now only Goth on the inside, started college, got married, wife left and grandparents arrested/institutionalized due to Alzheimer's/dementia in the same weekend, abruptly left college to move home to sort everything out, oh hey drugs, slowly watched my only family deteriorate before my eyes until they didn't even recognize me any longer, raging heroin addiction to try not to feel any of this, grandfather died, got in trouble with the law, lost everything I owned, homeless junkie interlude, lost almost 3 years of my life in jail/prison over less than $4,000 worth of bad checks, oops can't get a decent job due to criminal record, congestive heart failure, almost die, start getting my life back together, meet a nice girl, marry nice girl, grandmother dies, oh hey again drugs, finally got off the drugs, surprise wife departure, heart failure keeps getting worse, can barely walk, can't work anymore, no job, no insurance, no access to healthcare.

That about sums it up the backstory. I finally have gotten some healthcare and counseling. Sadly, I can no longer work. I'm trying to go through the disability process, but that takes a great deal of time. It is difficult without proper access to the doctors I need, but I'm getting there. I've also been clean for 4 years and I'm never going back to that dependence. Never before in my life did I ever feel like I was completely done with drugs, but this time it has really stuck. Haven't even had any cravings and now it never even crosses my mind. I'm finally in a good and stable place in my recovery.

Now I have other issues though. Poverty is very real. The threat of eviction looms nearly every month. Being able to afford the 12 different prescriptions I take is really hard and I find myself cutting pills in half because even $70 a month for medicine is a real challenge. I was able to get enrolled back in college and that is the plan of how to survive until I graduate and find work I'm physically able to handle. I'm working towards a career in counseling because I want to be able to use all of these nightmare experiences to help other people. I want to use what time I have left on this planet to help others and hopefully leave it better than I found it.

That is how you end up alone on your 40th birthday, typing on an ancient laptop that you pray survives a couple more months until you transfer schools and can get a replacement with financial aid funds. My family died. Drugs pushed everyone away for years except other drug addicts and an addict isn't anyone's friend. I am no longer able to work, so I don't have those human connections anymore. My wife had been my best friend, so when she surprised me by suddenly leaving the last person I had a connection with went with her. Now that my congestive heart failure has progressed just walking enough to shop for groceries, take out the trash, or getting the mail is a huge challenge, so just going out to walk around and meet people is near impossible. Having zero available disposable income also doesn't help. If I can hold on a couple more months and everything works out I'll be able to switch schools and have more aid options that will take care of my financial and healthcare needs. I'm just trying to hold on and it is so hard.

There is the abbreviated story if you somehow stopped on this post and actually read through everything. If you made it this far, thank you for listening. If you have the time to say happy birthday or say something nice I would really appreciate it. You really don't know how much it would mean to me. No one else is going to tell me today, so you might get to be the only person that wishes me a happy birthday. I don't get any presents or any cake. I don't get a birthday meal or get to do anything cool. I don't get to go anywhere or see anyone. There won't be any birthday cards in the mail or celebratory emails. That's okay though. If one person manages to take the time to read this and let me know there is someone, anyone out there then it'll be alright.

Doing your best means knowing your limits and working within them.,It’s not the literal thing I read but something along those lines and I actually had an “OH” moment that I have extremely rarely. I never realized that I misheard doing my best as I should push myself to be *the* best. But how good you are at something is on a bell curve and if you strive past “your best” you will become worse.

Stop telling those with mental health problems what they're doing wrong without telling them what the right action is.,"One of the things I regularly see people doing when trying to help those with mental health problems is to call out how they're thinkin negatively or irrationally or whatever they're doing wrong. This is only half of the step. 
As someone who suffers from mental health problems this doesn't help. It just feels like a dig.

When you point this out, I already know. I know I'm being irrational, I know I'm being negative, but I don't know how to be rational or positive. I need help. 

I need you to tell me what the rational or positive thought is, I need to be made aware of the exact actions I could take or thoughts I could have to help me stop feeling this way and I guarantee other people do to. 

When we're criticised on the way we're thinking and not given any advice it can be a trigger.

I'm so happy I didn't commit suicide last May.,"I was at such a low point. I voluntarily checked myself into a psych ward last May because I found myself idealizing suicide, drawing up plans to end it, and getting my finances in order...I gave most of my things away, said my goodbyes, even wrote a letter... I'm currently sitting behind my desk at work - my boss isn't in and I have my own office so I'm completely alone, with no one to bother me. I get paid well for my position, along with being a student. I've become an EMT, I'm finishing up my dual degree in computer science and mathematics, my relationships with the people who matter most to me are at an all time high. I have self-worth, confidence, I'm making healthier physical health and mental health choices, I'm achieving all of my dreams and aspirations...and I'm happy. I'm genuinely happy. I compared how I am doing this summer to last summer, and the improvement is MAGNIFICENT. I now enjoy life and see that there is SO much to live for.

It's tough at times. Sometimes it gets really lonely, dark, empty....lifeless...but that's not true. Your life is full of life because YOU'RE alive. You have so much potential. You just need to tap into it. I did it... and I'm finally in a better place after 5 years of a shit storm - you can, too! I promise! (: Hang in there friend. No matter how long the fight takes - stay in that ring. It'll be all so much worth it when you get through to the other side.

Stop telling boys that they shouldn't cry.,"When I was around 10 years old, I watched my teenage brother nurse a wound. He was crying as he soaked his scraped knee with water in the bathtub.

I looked at him with disdain. ""Why are you crying?"" I asked in annoyance. I didn't realize it then, but my visceral reaction to his emotional vulnerability reflected something that I had been taught earlier in my childhood: boys aren't supposed to cry. 

When I became a young adult, I had a lot of trouble expressing my emotions. I put on a smile for everyone I saw, and avoided talking about anything that would trigger an emotional reaction. When my emotions built up to the point where I couldn’t control them, I would explode. It took a long time to learn how to share my feelings - something that people still consider to be a sign of weakness in men.

I think I’m one of the millions of men out there who’ve been told, at some point in their lives, to repress their emotions. I now understand how emotional repression can lead to a variety of complications in mental health. I wrote a song to challenge the idea that men shouldn’t show their feelings simply because they are men. Listen link below.

For all the guys out there listening to this song - be vulnerable. Feel your emotions. Share with others how you feel. I think that’s even more manly than being a tough guy.

Thank you guys so much for reading this. Please be safe, everyone. xoxo

Two weeks ago I was almost homeless. Now I got a job and a place to stay and my mental health seems to be improving a lot,"I think is important to share some positive news as well since sometimes we just come here in our lowest times, and I shared here previously when I thought I was at one of the direst moments of my life.

It has been two weeks, I was basically out of money in a new city, have searched everywhere for a job but couldn't find any, so I decided to go to the social services center at the town hall to see if they could help me anyway. Shared with the staff my story and how I was going to be homeless that same day, but since it is a small city, the social worker contacted a friend of hers that owned a place that was looking for a woman to cook, clean and receive guests at a private tourist attraction.  

Although I'm male, she decided to give me a chance, and so it has been two weeks of hard work but everything is working out so far. I actually like the job a lot, and my employer seems to be quite happy with my performance and already increased my salary from past week. 

My anxiety and depression are way under control now. It seems that since my work requires more doing and less thinking it just keeps my mind better focused in the job and been glad for this opportunity that while I still get some intrusive thoughts once in a while, they are way less aggressive than they were in the past few months/years.

So that is it. Just sharing a story with a better ending than I expected so that, maybe, it give those of you guys who are still facing harder times, a glimmer of hope that things may get better for you too.

"Revived a Baby, Feel Really Raw","Two days ago, my neighbor whom I don't know came screaming for help out of her house. I happened to be walking my dog. After a split second of worrying I may be stepping into a domestic violence and, thus, dangerous situation, I knew I needed to help either way. So I ran up and said I could help. That's when I realized she was holding a non-responsive, not breathing baby. Time slowed down. I stashed my dog inside her front door, took the baby, and narrated each step of heimlich, sweeping the mouth, etc. I was eerily calm. And the baby started crying! I had to do it a second time when she stopped breathing again. Meanwhile, the woman who was her grandmother was on the phone with 911 and, understandably, in such a panic. The police came first, because neighbors called about the screaming. Then the ambulance a bit after that and a good 5-10 minutes after I got there. I feel so so lucky I happened to be there and somehow remembered lifeguard training from 15 years ago. And I feel humbled in like a pre-social media definition of it. And I feel weird that all the other neighbors were watching but no one came to help. And most of all, I just feel raw. Like I feel really weird about it all and like I'm exposed. Extra weird thing is I saved someone kayaking 10 days prior. I have never saved anyone's life before. And two have two in 10 days as a regular person / non-first responder, and especially the baby two days ago, I am just shaken up.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/vyk3zb/revived_a_baby_feel_really_raw/,mentalhealth
I planned to kill myself today but I didn’t.,"EDIT: I am overwhelmed by the support I have been provided today. After coming home from work all I did was lay down today and dick around on the internet and for this to be part of my general tomfoolery I use to distract myself, I am grateful. I don’t really know how to reply to everyone. I’ve largely snapped out of it but I am still frazzled and having a lot of trouble getting back to sleep (it’s 3AM as I type this). I don’t have weapons or drugs that could easily kill me, I am not alone, so I will be okay. I’ll try to focus on spending time with myself tomorrow and do something to make myself feel better. Thank you again for the support. 


I woke up this morning with an unshakable feeling that today would be the day I finally commit suicide. I figured I could throw myself in front of a train. I said goodbye to my boyfriend and told him I love him. 
I ended up not doing that because I had professional obligations and made promises. By the time it was over, my colleague offered to drive me home so I wouldn’t take the train. So, I got home safe and was able to snap out of it. 
It feels like a bad dream and now I just want to lay down and go to sleep. 
I’ve been feeling horribly inferior to everyone around me. I’m not intelligent, I don’t have any special skills, and I really believe nothing will be lost if I died. I feel as if I should just accept my inherent worthlessness and just save everyone the trouble of me breathing their air. 

I don’t want to reach out to people who know me because I don’t want to worry them. And I certainly don’t want them thinking I’m just looking for attention or validation.

I broke my foot and was bed ridden for 6 months and became very depressed. Finally got to uni and failed the first year. Just failed my 2nd. I'm basically at 0 credits and 3 years behind where I'm supposed to be. My twin brother is almost graduating and I'm basically exactly where I was when I left highschool. I feel like I'm losing years off my life and for some reason I can't just live it.

Not to mention there's a lot of shitty things going on on top of all this and I just feel so fucking alone. I feel a loss of motivation to do anything. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel alone and unsupported, and so so afraid. I have no idea what my future holds, and I no longer have a dream. I just want to be happy again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/kdo2ej/i_failed_my_2nd_year_of_uni_and_i_just_need/,mentalhealth

my abuser is blowing up on tiktok,"edit; he/him pronouns please

edit 2: please stop giving me advice on how to expose him. I don't want revenge. I don't want to stoop to his level of low, ever, and I don't have the mental capacity to talk about what he did in a public space. what he did to me is already hard enough to deal with, without an added social media pressure. 

this was just a vent because it hurts seeing him live life happy and free of consequences. I've been through the legal system and they didn't do shit. I'm furious to see him succeed because he doesn't deserve to succeed. I am a victim of something horrible. I am angry and hurt and I'm allowed to be. 

and for fucks sake, if I get one more victim blaming or rape apologist comment I'm gonna lose my shit. it is NOT my fault that he raped me. it is NOT my fault if he rapes someone else, because ""I didn't warn people"". fuck you.

(original post below)

I unblocked him to do my yearly ""stay the fuck away from me"" search. he's got a good 250k on TikTok, and all I could feel was anger. he's a rapist and an emotional manipulator and he's a horrible person, and he has all this support behind him. it makes me sick to my stomach. 

I'm not strong enough mentally to actually speak up about what he's done and in Australia you can get sued. I'm not about to give myself more trauma by speaking out about what he did to me. it just makes me fucking fuming that he's got all this support and love, and I'm stuck here, knowing what he did to me and suffering the aftermath. he deserves to rot in hell",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/srgcvr/my_abuser_is_blowing_up_on_tiktok/,mentalhealth

"A seagull ate my hotdog, and I realised how much I want to be alive.","Today I rode to the beach. I bought a hotdog and a seagull swooped from the sky and nipped it and dropped it on the floor. I quickly picked it up and in my fury said ""fucking bullshit"" and ""I will not allow this seagull to get the better of me and stop me enjoying this hotdog I paid for"" and quickly ate it anyway. Gross I know but it was a very quick nip and it was on the ground for less than a second. Anyway after I ate it I started getting anxious about ""what if I contract bird flu and die"" and started to overthink a lot about what diseases I could get and so on. I started to think about if I died how much I'd miss my friends, my family and how there's so much I still want to do like meet my future wife, have a family, help people, build a career, play xbox, play with my dog and enjoy surfing etc. And because of this I realised how much I actually want to be here and how much I love being alive and don't want to leave. 

A few months ago I was in a really dark place and I was getting scared I'd never see the light and it would just keep going downhill, and today a seagull stole my hotdog and I realised how happy I am and how far I've come, and I'm really proud of myself for improving my mental health and look forward to all the beautiful and exciting things to come in future. Hopefully you had a laugh at this situation like I did, and maybe find something in it if you're struggling. And watch out for those airborne demons next time you get a hotdog.

When you commit suicide usually you believe with all your heart that everyone in the world would be better off without you or that they don't care. It is the most unselfish thing I can think of. Not saying its a good idea, but being able to give up your own life just to make everyone a little happier (even if it doesn't actually, but just in the person's head) is not selfish. It's horrible, tragic, but not selfish.

"Can you be a ""highly functioning"" chronically depressed person?","I've been feeling just awful, unmotivated, anxious, unhappy for at least three years now. There are ups and downs to this feeling, though it never goes away completely. Sometimes it gets very bad for a very brief moment, but even then I am able to perform daily tasks, I take care for my dog, I keep myself and my flat \[relatively\] clean, I even eat well. I'm reliable. My job situation is not the best, but I somehow manage from paycheck to paycheck. I manage, I just struggle *inside* all the time. There is not a day that I don't feel (at least) ""a little down"".

Whenever I feel like seeking help, I remember some people I've known who were diagnosed with depression. Some couldn't get out of bed for weeks, some seemed to have disappeared from the face of earth for months. Many self-harmed. Compared to them I'm completely fine, just oddly upset, resigned and a little fearful 24/7.

I feel like I'd be wasting a psychiatrist's time with my crap. On the other hand I think that I backed myself into a corner. I'm keeping my head above water, so I'm not drowning, but I can't get out of the water either, because I'm too weak. Can I be depressed?

Thank you. I’m a student and really struggling with money. I also have CPTSD and severe anxiety, and I haven’t left my room in a while. One of my favorite self care things is just going to get a cup of coffee. My thought is that if the only interaction of the day I have is a minute with a barista, that’s enough for me. I have $25 to my name until I get paid next week, and i woke up this morning sad and honestly only wanting coffee. I felt guilty going to Starbucks when I know there’s drip coffee in the dorms and dining hall (coffee is coffee and I shouldn’t complain, but it’s nasty). 

But I went because I needed to leave my dorm and get outside. And when you took my order, you said you accidentally hit an option that did something to make it free. You said it already went to print so you didn’t want to bother re-entering it, so you let me have my drink for free.

Calling Suicide Selfish,"I saw someone on my friends list post about someone they knew who committed suicide being selfish and I am not in the mood to play around about this. Let me fucking tell you something. I am so sick and tired of hearing people say that suicide is selfish. You want to know what's fucking selfish? Expecting someone else to live for you. Expecting someone to put their own personal pain to the side for your fucking happiness. Expecting your relationship or companionship to be that saving grace to pull anyone through a deep depression. THAT is the epitomy of selfish. It is no one's responsibility to do anything that makes other people happy or comfortable. You are not owed any of that. You don't get to tell someone who's suicidal that they're selfish for considering it and that they should think about others egos before their suffering. You don't get to call someone selfish after they commit suicide because they didn't think about everyone else's feelings when they obviously couldn't even handle their own. On top of the fact that it's disrespectful to speak ill of the dead. How selfish do you have to be to have the audacity to call someone selfish when you are the one who wants a dangerously depressed person to continue suffering just so you can continue to ignore all the symptoms but hand them a god damn gold start sticker for being alive like it fucking helps anything? And before you even bring religion into the conversation, news flash, Not everyone believes in your God so telling someone ""God doesn't make mistakes"", ""Suicide is a sin"", ""God only gives us what we can handle"", or some other idiotic bullshit, doesn't bring everyone comfort and sometimes it makes things worse. And that's not your opportunity to tell them all the ways they need to find God. Because again: Not. Everyone. Believes. In. Your. Fucking. God. End of. Telling a suicidal person that wanting to end their pain is selfish will only tell them that they cannot confide in you and it marks you as an unreliable support system. It will more than likely make them pull away from you and make them feel even more isolated. YOU'RE NOT HELPING! And don't use the excuses ""I've been through worse and I don't want to kill myself"" or ""Other people have it worse"" because you obviously don't understand what mental illness is. Being depressed about a situation is so much different than being clinically depressed. Situational depression lasts through a particular struggle. Clinical depression is being sad for almost no god damn reason. Don't compare the two because you're only making yourself look like more of an asshole. It is selfish of you to want someone to continue suffering just to make you happy. Get off your fucking high horse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/t64pxk/calling_suicide_selfish/,mentalhealth
Mental health problems are not beautiful or trendy and I am so done with the media glamorizing it.,"Can the media stop glamorizing this notion that battling mental illness is beautiful or trendy?

I’m all for expressing emotions in a healthy manner and using music as an emotional outlet, and certainly want to hear music that is honest... but not at the cost of minimizing the pain and struggles that people all over the world face on a daily basis. 

Being broken is not beautiful, being broken is sobbing uncontrollably when you have a delay getting your meds refilled while your boyfriend strokes your hair trying to convince you that things will get better. 

Addiction is not the modern day version of Romeo and Juliet, addiction is an stable & irreversible at best or a death sentence at worst. 

Staying in an abusive relationship is not “being loyal to your man/woman” and you’re not better than anyone else for “fighting through the bullshit” - you’re suffering from Stockholm Syndrome and I hope to God you get out soon.

It’s been 10 years since my suicide attempt and I’m so glad I didn’t succeed!!,"Somehow I missed my 10 year anniversary of the worst day of my life. I suppose that’s a good thing that I’m so involved with the good bits of life now that I almost forgot that this wasn’t always the case. 

Ten years ago I threw my legs out a 6th floor window at college, intending to hit the earth below me. I was in the thick of some really terrible times then. I was 19, heartbroken, homesick, lost, and very confused. I remember the sharp air that rushed in the room when I opened the window that very cold and snowy February night. It felt like little needles on my skin; a stark contrast to the hot, salty tears streaming down my face. I was in trouble for drinking on campus...again.  However, the drinking wasn’t just purely fun and games. I was using it to cope with a lot of uncertainty and hopelessness. My on again off again boyfriend told me he was dating someone else. He lived with my best guy friend at the time so a lot of “sides” were taken in the whole mess. And somewhere along the way my roommate moved out. I was alone. 

I spent the remainder of the week at the hospital under psychiatric care. The days I spent there blur together now. I was in such a haze of numbness. 
My entire life was uprooted. I got kicked out of college and I had to start over somewhere new. The next several years were spent kicking my ass into gear to show myself and the friends who abandoned me that they didn’t get the best of me. I pushed and pushed myself. I started looking forward and not backward. I learned to love myself again. Slowly. Very slowly. 

I graduated from a new (and better) college with honors two years later. I took a chance and bought a one way ticket to NYC and began living the life I used to only be able to dream about.

10 years later, I am living proof that things get better. Depression and anxiety are challenges I still deal with occasionally, but now I know how to handle it. 

Right now I’m sitting in the house I just bought all by myself. I’m reminiscing about the years I spent living and working in Manhattan, where I had an incredible job and amazing friends. Most days, my life felt like a happy movie. I recently decided to re-locate, slow things down and enjoy the present. Now I’m in the process of renovating my house from the inside out. I volunteer with an organization that raises funds for underprivileged women and children. I carve out time for my hobbies, friends, and loved ones. I’ve truly become a better person. I can now enjoy a glass or two of wine without overdoing it just to cope. I can take a deep breath, a small sip, and appreciate how far I’ve come.

I still have a long way to go. I’m still a work in progress. I haven’t found love yet but I look forward to the day I do. In the meantime, you can catch me cultivating my new herb garden and reading a good book or two. 

If you’re going through what I went through 10 years ago, my best advice is to hang on, know it does get better (and no this isn’t something that people just say. It’s true). You’re not alone. You’re loved. And you’re stronger than you think.
Take a deep breath, be thankful that you are able to do so, and repeat until you truly believe better days are around the corner.

TLDR - I’m 10 years post-suicide attempt and better than ever. I wanted to share my accomplishment with you all and hope this story might help someone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/g08eol/its_been_10_years_since_my_suicide_attempt_and_im/,mentalhealth

I feel like my “trauma” isn’t valid because it’s not as bad as a lot of other people’s.,"I’ve always been a troubled kid, and I don’t want to get into what happened but I had a situation between me and my family when I was 10 that lead me down a 9 year trail of pure pain and anxiety.

I have never been hit, everything was verbal.
I’ve never been in an abusive relationship.
I’ve never been bullied or sent to a hospital.

"How I became a happier and kinder person, and accidently started liking myself a lot more","I did a random experiment on myself a few years ago. I did not read about this anywhere, I just thought of it and decided to try it.


I forced myself to think nice thoughts about every stranger I see. When I see someone on the street, I think of something nice about that person. Like ""their hair look so good"", ""what a nice smile"", ""those legs are great"" etc. In the beginning it was hard. Like, the first thought that popped up was something mean, but then I followed it up to find something good about the person.


If I don't find anything nice to think about their appearances (it happens), I don't force it, instead I make a nice assumption about them. I think ""she probably has a great sense of humour"", ""he is probably a great dad"", ""this person could be very creative"" etc. Just whatever pops up, and the great part is, it doesn't matter if it's true or not. I just form a nice assumption in my mind. 


In the beginning I had to consciously make the decision to think something nice. After a while it started automatically happen. It's been years, but now every time I go out I think mostly kind thoughts about people. This lead me to think more nice thoughts about myself. When I see myself in a mirror, I'm no longer trained to search for flaws, I automatically think nice things about myself aswell. I'm a much more confident person due to this.


If you want to try this, I recommend starting with strangers. When that becomes natural, apply it to everyone. Your classmates, your colleagues, your friends. Force yourself to focus on the positives. If you think something negative of someone, thats perfectly okay, but follow it up with something nice. Now I have an easier time giving people spontaneous and genuine compliments, because that's how my mind works. I'm a lot happier and calmer around people when I think kind thoughts about everyone. And this is not something that happened naturally, I had to train myself to do this, and it worked!

I want to add, that I've had some friends that were the opposite. The kind that thinks it's fun to roast everyone they see and say mean things about strangers or acquaintances. I talked to them about this, talked to them about how I'm changing my mindset and asked them to not behave like this around me. Some changed, some I am no longer friends with. Not a big loss, in hindsight. People that act like that was a negative influence in my life anyway. 


If you try this, good luck, and please let me know how it goes for you :) It will probably feel super weird and silly in the beginning, but try to stick with it for a while and see what happens to your thought patterns!",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/r8q060/how_i_became_a_happier_and_kinder_person_and/,mentalhealth
"Has anyone else lost ""friends"" that made it seem like your mental illness was a bigger inconvenience for them than it was for you?","I use the word ""friends"" loosely, because they no longer hold that title.

I went through a pretty rough phase of about six months. My depression and anxiety were at an all-time high. I won't go into all the details, but I just needed someone to be there for me.

I was told, by two friends of 10+ years, that my depression was ""too much,"" and that they ""couldn't handle it."" They told me that I needed to ""own up to my actions"" (being depressed, I guess???). Then, they just deleted me from everything and stopped talking to me. Some friends, eh?

Still makes me sick to this day. But perhaps, it's better to be rid of those people.

Don't get me wrong, I know it can be difficult when your friends don't have their shit together. But isn't that what friends are for? To support you and be there for you when you're in a dark place?

I can't even imagine doing what they did. But maybe that's just me.

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone has experienced this as well. Please feel free to share your stories. Would be nice to know I'm not completely alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ks6ow3/has_anyone_else_lost_friends_that_made_it_seem/,mentalhealth

My suicidal thoughts and depression.,"If you're reading this can you please upvote it so others can see, thanks for reading this as well it just helps me I guess.

My names Jack, I'm 15 years old, bi (not come out to anyone), have dandruff, acne, pretty fucking ugly all things considered... And severe anxiety and depression.

I was living great until last June. At the time I had 2 best mates, who I'll refer to as M (funny, kind but not entirely good to talk about mental health and touchy feelings) and K (kindest person ever, used to be able to speak about anything to, but mentally isn't great). K had severe mental health issues and was not listening to anybodys advice about seeking help. Eventually I asked M if I should confront her about it, he agreed, I did it because my other friend who I'll refer to as J (narsasistic, arrogant, but has a soft side occasionally) had been telling me for months she was an attention seeker. I figured she'd take it alright but I was wrong. She trusted me more than anyone (her words) and it was the worst thing anyone had apparently told her.

It bothered me alot and I kept trying to make ammends because I felt TERRIBLE.

I was relatively stable in the grand scheme tho.

2 months pass and August aka summer holidays hits! Worst month and a half ever. J had somehow convinced M I was basically a backstabbing, lying piece of shit and essentially the worst person ever.

We argued back and forth for a while. We fell out hard to say the least.

It broke my heart losing both M and K (I guess J) in such a short time and the misery started to sink in.

HOPE WASN'T LOST. I had 2 friends left B (kind, nice to talk with, quiet) and Z (think J but a geek gamer and a textbook bully) I had a plan to get M K and J face to face (all previous stuff was done by text). Z was on holiday. So I tried asking B to get them together, he said to wait until school but I insisted as K didn't go to our school. I accepted tho. However (according to what I've been told) B lied I think and told Z I had manipulated him into trying to get them all together. Z bullied the shit out of me.

This is where I think my depression sunk in, I couldn't think properly, lashed out in anger out everyone, was bored of gaming, etc. Moral of the story, I wanted to put a bullet in my head!

September hit and school started (year 10). Depressed anxious and suicidal my studies went down and thus my grades.

Then my parents split, IT SUCKED. My father isn't exactly great, he can be abusiveish at times.

Everything started to get worse and I ran away several times, and dragged a knife across my arm alot.

I started to sit in the library for most of the day and still did until corona. Got sent work and it definitely helped with my anxiety as I was bullied and a laughing stock in year 9. Pretty badly. So being out of lessons was alright.

I started seeing the school councillor which helped to have someone to talk to. 

In December the school had no choice but to take me to arrow park hospital as I had massive scars across my chest from self harm. I stayed overnight and my parents ended up kinda talking things out.

I had to go to therapy to say the least. I was still on the edge of suicide.

Started the 8 week course this January and it was alright. Helped keep me positive. 
J and Z made me want to die more as they constantly reminded me of what I am, a monster. Told me I was worthless, should just do it and brought up my Instagram stories (I used to post on them suicidal stuff as a cry for help but was just accused of attention seeking). Worse too. 

Throughout the next 2 months I still stayed mostly the same. Suicidal, depressed, anxious, most importantly lonely. Me and M eventually worked things out because I actually put the effort in a lot over several months begging him and K to help me and how sorry I was. They didn't really want to be my friend. K and I are currently on OK terms I think, imma take it slow with her. M and I talk a lot now.

But... I still feel lonely, have to hide how I feel now. Don't really have anyone to talk about this stuff to. Anymore at least. I still hate my life. Want to die. Does make me wonder if I'm actually really liked by anyone.

But how would I describe myself? Gamer (mk11, overwatch, paladins and smash), want to do well but knows I can't, socially awkward on 1 to 1s, try to be funny, nice to people who I care for and are nice to me, would die for my closest friends. But I'm lonely ultimately, depressed, can't ride a bike, swim, fear of driving etc.

I don't know if anyone will make it this far, but if you are, and if you are my age, thank you, I don't know what you really can reply with but please upvote as it just helps I guess my self esteem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/gnnvwi/my_suicidal_thoughts_and_depression/,mentalhealth

Recovering from depression really feels like I’m trying to stay “sober”,"First I’ve never had to deal with substance abuse, and if what I saying is insensitive please let me know.
 
It really does feel like what I imagine abstaining from alcohol or drugs feels like, but instead of that, your abstaining from bad choices. For example, can’t stay out with friends because if I don’t have a regular sleep routine, it will drastically effect my mood. Can’t drink a lot of caffeine because it will effect my sleep schedule and my mood. Can’t drink alcohol because with messes with my medication and my mood. Can’t think those negative thoughts or otherwise I will spiral. Can’t stay in bed all morning, or otherwise you’ll stay in bed all day or even several days. I have to perform basic hygiene even though it is really hard today, or else you’ll feel ten times worse.

Was wondering if anyone else felt like this?

Edit: oh wow! I did not expect this to get any comments or votes. I have suffered depression for over a decade, staring in my teen years. I did not get the help that I needed until recently, and therefore developed many bad habits to try and cope with it. But for the past few months I’ve been working on getting better, but then I spiraled really bad during the holidays because I strayed from my rigid routine. So now I’m trying to start all over again. But it really helps to know that other people feel this way too.

"If you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, this the wisdom I’ve gathered since my suicide attempt a decade ago.","First and foremost you need some rest. I would say that 10/10 times when I have suicidal ideation it’s also when I am over tired or over worked.

Secondly there are people in your life that genuinely care enough to force you into help. I know it’s scary to reach out to them and admit that you are having a hard time alone but I whole heartedly recommend it. I would not be alive to type this if it weren’t for the wonderful people in my support network. One method my friend and I came up with is that I can kill myself, I just have to get his permission first. This gives me the benefit of having the “option” but also puts the social pressure on me to never do it. 

I know you might think no one gives a shit, but the same people who would be devastated if you died would probably prefer to help you out before it gets to that point. There is something socially validating about suicide in the brain of the suicidal. It feels easier than to admit you are having a hard time. You feel like people will take what you are going through seriously. But plain and simple you will not be around to enjoy that validation because you will be dead. And all the people who would have helped you will be asking what they could have done. Instead of leaving the people you love on this Earth with the trauma of dealing with your death, please reach out to them.

Lastly what you have gone through is not easy. You may feel exhausted, defeated or even angry at others. Self reflection might be productive but you are right to feel angry at how they treated you. What you do with that anger is your responsibility now and it seems like you are just letting it eat away at you. Maybe there is some way to can transfer that anger into productivity or artistic expression. Who knows?

You have real problems. They suck, you’re totally right to feel that way. You should feel no blame that shitty things happen to you. But these problems are still your responsibility. And there are people out there who can help. Again I would not be alive today if it wasn’t for the friend I mentioned above and a wonderful therapist who came in at the right time. You may not have luck the first few times; my first therapist sent me into a mental breakdown. But I promise you that you will find the right fit if you keep trying.

Focus on the problems that you can solve. I think about the serenity prayer they say in AA every day. “Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference”. There are many issues in your life you may not have control over, but there are some that you do. Focus on those. Try to define them as precisely as possible. Don’t say “everybody hates me”. Say “everybody hates me when I ______”. The first is a cry of defeat. The second gives you a concrete area of yourself that you can improve. I always tell my friend “if you are going to hate yourself, at least be more specific”.

There is so much in life worth living for. A beautiful sunrise, your daughter’s graduation some day. Hell even if it’s just a new season of a tv show you love. The future is a mystery, and that’s a good thing. It means that everything is going to change. If things are good they are going to get worse. But that also means if things are bad they are going to get better. Take solace in that during the bad times and prepare yourself what things feel like they are going too well.

Don’t hesitate to dm me if there is anything I can help you with. We’re all on this crazy ride together.

God bless.

Edit:
Thank you to everyone who shared their stories or sent their kind words. 

I hope that this post does not glamorize suicide attempts in any way. Yes I tried, but that doesn’t delegitimize the suffering of someone who hasn’t. Just because you haven’t attempted doesn’t make your situation any less valid or serious compared to anyone else’s. Remember my words above: a suicidal persons warped sense of reality tells them that suicide is a better option than reaching out for help. It is not. Ever.

Many of you have reached out to me in a PM and I thank you for reaching out to someone. I am always a friend in need to someone but I am not a professional. There are REAL professionals out there making a difference just waiting to be the change you need in your life. Remember the best thing you can do is reach out.

Did your parent ever say “stop crying before i give you something to cry about”?,"EDIT : i should say children under 6 or 7 !! 

So many parents (mine included) said this to me as a child. I think it’s so harmful to children because they are tiny humans with emotions that they don’t understand how to control, and my personal opinion is that it is a parent’s responsibility to teach their child how to navigate negative emotions.

"I like to think, whenever you ""pour one out"" for a friend or family member who has passed, in whatever afterlife you picture them in, a cup appears in front of them and they get to drink whatever you poured out for them.","I'll start by saying, I'm agnostic. And I dont really believe in absolutes. Because no one can see the future. No one really knows whats happening in someone else's head. And you can't predict who will pull through whatever, or who will be lost to whatever. And there's no way to really know what happens when we die. 

In all honesty, that thought brings me comfort. I dont think im a bad person. Sure, ive done shitty things, im human, like you (I assume). But this mindset is what has gotten me through some rough shit. 

2019 Is my worst year to date. August 24, a good friend who I really looked up to, committed suicide. I credit him to be a big part in preventing my own suicide. Then in November a great uncle and a high school classmate, both i was very fond of, passed within a couple days of each other. Then December 10, my grandma passed after a stroke the week prior. Her husband, my grandpa passed in May 2020. 

That was a bad time, as you can imagine. I had never lost anyone I was ever close to before then. My friends suicide being the big thing im still struggling with today. But whenever I have a beer, or some liquor, I pour one out in his/their name. 

I like to imagine my friend in Valhalla. As of all the afterlives that I know of, thats where he belongs. As he is a fucking legend. He lost his battle with depression, but he fought fucking hard. I still laugh and smile at the thought of him in any afterlife yelling at whoever is in charge because they don't understand the rules of whatever afterlife Pathfinder game he's running. 

And I like to think that wherever he, my grandparents, my old high school buddy, and my great uncle may be. When I pour one out, a beautiful mug full of that liquid is presented to them. 

Which that thought is made better by the fact that often times, im drinking really shitty cheap booze. And they look up from wherever they are and are just kinda ""what the fuck? You pour one out in mourning and im stuck with your shitty 1 dollar beer?"" 

I dont know, just a thought that may help someone in mourning. Hang in there, stranger. No matter how shitty life gets, it will always get better.  And despite the fact that life will get shitty again at some point, it WILL get better again.

New job! Still homeless but I got a new job! Mental health is on the uptick!,"I am so fucking excited.   


Story time.   


Before Covid hit I was a leasing agent for a large Canadian REIT.  I was important, I was valued, I was paid very well. I had everything I wanted. I was fortunate enough to be sent to Calgary to launch one of the largest private student housing projects in Canadian history. Was a big big deal in the industry. Then Covid came along and decimated the Student housing industry. 50% of our clients were international and of the remaining 50% being domestic, only a small fraction of those were 'locally domestic' You can imagine what losing 90% of your paying clients can do for a project.  


I lost my job and came home defeated. My mental health suffered. My physical health suffered. My relationship suffered. I wasn't working, I wasn't a partner anymore. My girl left me in Dec.   


Things were hard. I was alone, I'm very much an introvert. The only people I talk to are people via Reddit or random women on dating apps. There's nobody I could call to come over and hang out with. Nobody I could call if I was having a dark moment. And there were many dark moments let me tell you.   


Winter blues is a thing. I'm a huge believer in that. I was living in a basement apartment that my ex and I shared before she left. I was so immobile emotionally and physically that for 5 months after she left I couldn't bring myself to removing anything she left behind. She took the cats, but the cat food sat in its dish for months. Her clothes still hung in the closet the way she left them. Every day was a dark dank lonely sad existence. I knew I needed a change. I had to change my outlook, my direction, my goals.   


I started talking to people on dating apps. I had no intention of seeing anyone. I just needed to talk to people again. That helped. I also started being more active on Reddit, that helped too. I like talking with people, I like giving advice. Small uptick in mental health after this.   
Then the sun started coming out. The grey dirty snow started going away. It was the end of April. Forced myself to go outside, even for a minute. Even for that very short walk to get milk. Instead of ordering it I went and got it. Small uptick in mental health after this.   
I got closure with my ex. Finally. Small uptick here.   


I needed something drastic though.   


So, voluntary homelessness. I left my apartment. I rented a room, and when that went to shit I started living out of my car. Waking up in the bush, next to a river, down by the ocean did wonders. Not caring or worrying about anything. Nothing at all, just being entirely selfish in my needs, my mental health. Huge uptick. I started smiling again. I started feeling better about everything.

Was going to spend the entire summer living outta my car. Then one random night I applied for a building manager job. Its become so much more than that.   


I was just given a job offer for a leasing agent role AND a building manager role. For a smaller REIT, but this position will require me to be very mobile. I could be driving 3hrs away to one of our buildings. I will never sit in an office. The company car is my office.   


Its going to be a couple weeks before I can afford an apartment, or I might just continue to live out of my car. Which may be tough because I'll also have a company car. So we'll see what happens there.   


But huge huge uptick. Motivation is high. Excitement is high. Self worth is high. I'm valued again. They were hugely impressed with my skill set, and its feels so damn good to be valued again.   


I wanted to share this because I've said to 100s of people on this very same sub that things can change, but you need to be the catalyst for that change. Nobody is going to come along and place change at your feet. You are responsible for everything that happens in your life, regardless of what has happened in your life. Wake up tomorrow, forge forward, make a small change in your life and allow it to snowball.   


Things are on an uptick now, but things dont get any easier. With this uptick comes a tremendous amount of responsibility. People are invested in me. This motivates me. I'll wake up tomorrow for my first day with a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm but will have to know and understand that a downtick can come at anytime. I'll deal with those when they come, I'm not going to worry about something that hasn't happened yet.   


Forward progress. Be the catalyst for change and personal growth. Have your pity party. Be sad. Have regret. But you gotta get over it, you gotta find closure and move on because the world will continue to spin without you. May aswell spin with it amirite?",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/o0zh4u/new_job_still_homeless_but_i_got_a_new_job_mental/,mentalhealth
I dont want to kill myself but I don't want to be alive either. It feels like I'm being forced to suffer and the only things that make me happy are just distractions from getting better.,"I fucking hate myself and everyone around me. I hate my mother, my dad and my brother. I hate my best friend. I hate my fucked up body and being alive is just morbid and disgusting. My mum is refusing to take proper care of my pets which I now have 5 of because she wanted more and will probably try to get more. I do the best I can but she still fucking overfeeds them so my two new kittens are going to be overweight and sick like the rest of my animals. 

If I show any sign of disagreement which is basically fucking impossible because she will literally say ""look how fat theyre getting isnt it cute"" and I cant help but look miserable or telling her that what shes doing is wrong. She will threaten to kick me out to move in with my dad which she has done multiple times before. I cant stay there because the whole house is covered in mould and I have breathing issues because Ive been smoking cigarettes, weed, heroin, pills, suboxone and tons of other crap since I was 12 years old. My breathing is so fucked I am constantly aware of my lungs and just breathing fresh air makes me feel so disgusted to be alive. I have an infection in my mouth and another in my sinus, which I basically have permanently because of the fucked up structure of my face.

Im not taking drugs anymore but I still smoke a cigarette every few days and I am so guilty because no matter how hard I seem to try, I cant even take care of myself. 

I live in fucking sydney where the house and rent prices are so fucked even if could find a trade or work I wouldnt be able to move out. The only person I had that understood and was there with me through all this shit was raped and murdered almost two years. He was my best fucking friend, the only person my age that I had been friends with in 6 years. My other best and only friend is addicted to fucking heroin and has aspergers so he just jumps to conclusions and gets mad at me if I show him any sort of emotion about things that are going on in my life, he just thinks im weak. I stopped seeing him because hes a horrible fucking influence. but I end up visiting him every week because i want social contact, but I just end up regretting it and leaving his house after an hour.

Ive recently been diagnosed with fucking epilepsy so thats fun. I have seizures when I dont get enough sleep, and I cant because my mum is fucking yelling or if im at my dads house he is up all night singing and working. Literally all night he sleeps from 6 am to 4 pm. So im constantly worried about having a siezure and I try so hard to get good sleep. So recently my sleeps been good enough that I dont think im at seizure risk, but still bad enough that my health is on a strong and steady decline. 

My brother doesnt talk to me, hes becoming an alcoholic. I mean hes been drinking everyday for the past year, but atleast hes stopped stealing off me and doesnt threaten to beat me up everytime I make eye contact with him anymore. 

I really dont want to kill myself but I have felt so bad my whole life and I cant seem to turn it around that I think if it keeps going it will be the only reasonable option. This is fucking bullshit. Why the fuck are the people around my happy. They are all fucking kidding themselves and need to just accept the fact there lives fucking suck so maybe they might actually do something to help themselves and inturn the people that care about them.

I hate everyone I care about and it makes me so fucking angry. I cant ever express this anger to everyone I love thats hurting me because they just seem to treat me worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/lasseo/i_dont_want_to_kill_myself_but_i_dont_want_to_be/,mentalhealth

"I hate how people are expected to wait weeks, possibly MONTHS for mental health appointments.","Last month I had an appointment that I had to book out TWO months in advance. From then on, my next appointment is a month and a half away. Out of all the things to make people wait for, this is probably one of if not the WORST. Does the government or anyone with any position of power understand the consequences of making people who are trying to get their mental health examined wait long periods of time? More funding needs to be put into this. (also I wish society was less toxic and 'edgy' towards each other but I digress)

I myself am doing okay but I can't imagine the pain others go through when they're told that they have to wait several weeks or even months to get their next appointment and how agonizing it can be. It's like you're about to reach the finish line at a race and you slowly shrink in size, it taking progressively more and more time, energy and probably psychological madness to reach the finish line.

I just had sex for the first time since I was raped,"When I was 15 I was dating this guy who forced me to sleep with him because he'd tell me that no one else would ever love me and that he'd kill himself if I didn't fuck him. This continued for a year (we banged 6-7 times I think) and then he ghosted me for two months before breaking up with me over text. 

It's been almost 3 years since we broke up and I have since moved on. I just started going to a therapist who thinks I may have PTSD but I am not officially diagnosed. Last month I started dating a guy who I love more than anything. We tried to have sex near the beginning of our relationship but I had a panic attack and complete mental breakdown. we didn't try again until Monday night and I was able to not only have sex with him but also orgasm. It's been such a long struggle but now  I think I've met my soulmate and I don't know if I can be happier.  :)

I found a suicide note my bf wrote last night and I don’t know what to do,"I’ve been worried about my bf. We’ve been together for almost 11 years now. I monitor his search history because he doesn’t share his true feelings so this is how I know what he’s feeling. I went through his searches this morning and noticed him searching last night for “painless and effective methods of suicide” among other things. I went through his phone and found a suicide message written in it. 

I’ve found them before but always months after the fact. The last time he wrote something it was an update saying he was still standing and things were looking up. But this time it was a goodbye note. And that everything he thought was looking up was just a delusion. 

He was sleeping when I left for work today. I don’t know what to do. He wrote the note right before he went to bed. If I admit I looked he’ll be even more secretive in the future and then I just won’t know it’s happening (he’s so good at hiding it, the only way I know is by looking at his search history and he can easily make it incognito in the future if he’s aware). 

I’ve tried getting him to go to therapy and he doesn’t want to. 

I don’t know what to do. 

I took pictures of the note but I don’t know if I’m allowed to share it. 

Please don’t comment on me looking at his searches. I’m doing what I can to keep my loved one safe.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mkoer7/i_found_a_suicide_note_my_bf_wrote_last_night_and/,mentalhealth

My lights got cut off two days ago. My bill was 800 dollars which was too much to pay right away. I've been looking for a second job for so long, but haven't found anything. We haven't even had money for food hardly. I've lost weight because ive only been eating once a day.

Today i received help with my light bill. They payed the bill completely. I also found a second job which actually pays just as well as my first job, got enough food to last until my next paycheck(s), and found out me and my girlfriend are having a little girl. She also found a job opprotunity today, and i am going to court next week and my two other children will be coming to live with me permanently now. And i recieved a phonecall letting me know that i will be recieving free daycare today aswell.

After explaining my situation for a couple minutes he asks my name again, and then he says we have spoken before. He had remembered that I liked going for drives to clear my mind and remembered how I had told him about my friends that had been sent to jail and he asked how they were doing. I can’t deny that it brightened my day, I appreciated him so much. He told me about how his daughter also struggled with school and he understood what it was like.

Does anyone else have difficulty holding down jobs because of your illness?,"I feel like I always meet other adults who are able to work despite their illness and go to work everyday and be fine. But I never meet anyone else who just can't seem hold down jobs no matter how hard they try. I do really well for a month or two, I get praised for my work, I get friendly with co workers, I start to get into the groove of what I have to do. I don't know what happens I just spiral after that. My brain just gets tired of having to ""hold it in"" and act like everything is fine. The strain of having to override my feelings and force my brain to function starts to exhaust me and I can't conceal it for as long. Going into work starts to get harder and I have to find ways to take a break and cry. I call off too much because I can't handle it anymore. I have panic attacks at the thought of going in and end up quitting.

I called a suicide hotline recently and was dismissed because I’m a man and I have Tourette’s. 💦🦄😖,"I looked the # up on Google cause I was feeling unstable with signs of psychosis. I know these symptoms well enough after years of dealing with my illness.  I forced myself to remain calm so I could clearly communicate my situation. The woman (her name was Rachel)  speaking with was clearly overwhelmed by how many calls they’ve been getting.  When I told her I was having a mental health crisis she took me seriously enough, but then my verbal tics started.  I could tell that my tics were scaring her so I told her “I’m safe, I just have Tourettes”.  Then I heard the dreaded word come out of my mouth....cunt.  It was clearly a tic, but Rachel’s reaction was to tell me I couldn’t talk to her that way. Her tone went from scared shitless to anger. That was when I knew that there is not going to be any help for me. At least not from a woman.  I realized then that I wasn’t going to be able to get reliable help and to just get off the phone. To be honest, it kinda ramped up my paranoia also. 

Before I got off the phone I calmed myself and quietly told her, “YOU are a mental health professional who has trained for this. When a person experiencing a mental health crisis calls you and uses a word YOU find offensive you need to remember that YOU’RE feelings at that moment are minuscule compared to the pain the person on the other end is going through. Please think about this because you’re hurting some people more than you’re helping them”. 


I am so angry about this. I did everything right. I know from experience how broken our mental health system is, but this really hits a new low.  I took extensive notes because it seemed important and am really tempted to get that woman fired from her job for being so unprofessional, but frankly I’m worried I’ll get a woman on the line in HR and will again be dismissed because of sexism. From now on I will ask for and only speak with men when calling the Suicide Hotline(s).   

One thing I know for sure, I am not calling 911 for a trip to the psych ward anytime soon. If the mental health system is in this much crisis just over the phone imagine how bad it’s falling apart face to face. 

Thank god I’m already so used to self-isolating.

I got an apology from my old psychiatrist,"When I was 13 (around the early 2000s) my parents got worried as I was making the transition from elementary school to middle school. They had me see a psychiatrist who did no testing or talking with me before writing me a prescription for some SSRIs. The dosage was very high and my parents weren't told to taper me on or off. 


I had intense sleepiness, trouble caring about things, trouble remembering my friends' names. I slept so deeply that I didn't even wake up to my body's signals to use the bathroom; I was a teenaged boy pissing his own bed. My grades plummeted and that made my parents simply insist on higher doses. The psychiatrist I was seeing wrote those prescriptions too, still never looked me in the eye. 


I knew something was wrong, but it was months before I could focus enough to tell my parents. Luckily they listened and I never had to take those pills again. But for the next 18 years I went through life blaming myself for not adjusting to a new school quickly enough or well enough. When I was old enough to make my own appointments, I spent hours and hours (and hundreds of dollars) getting evaluated for every possible mental illness. I even had blood tests. All the tests came back saying I was normal and healthy, but it still tugged at me. 


A few weeks ago I found the courage to find that psychiatrist and then I wrote him a letter asking for an apology. I was respectful, stating the facts of the matter first and then moving on to how it made me feel in the years afterward. I was clear that I only wanted an apology, but didn't want to smear his reputation or harm him. I told him that he could reply or he could not, and if he didn't reply I wouldn't bother him further. 


Today he found me via Facebook and apologized. The relief and the confirmation I felt was nearly overwhelming.

Why isn’t there a such thing as an urgent care designed specifically for mental health emergencies?,"Why do emergency rooms exist for physical or extreme mental concerns but there is no such thing as a walk-in urgent mental health clinic?

I’ve wondered this for years. I’ve always had a panic disorder. During my first terrible panic attack at 21, I remember googling different mental health facilities in the area and limited info came up. I ended up calling the cops because I was afraid and felt like I couldn’t breathe, but knew it was psychological. The cops showed up and the only assistance they provided was suggesting that I sat in the back seat of their car. I felt ashamed sitting there, and as my panic dissipated, I just remember feeling hollow and empty. They couldn’t help me and unless I was truly a danger to myself or others, they weren’t going to commit me to any psych wards. So, they left and told me some “mobile counselors” would be on the way.

Eventually, I went back home and sat alone for 3 hours, trying to relax. These “mobile” counselors the cops said they would provide me with decided to give me a call and ask if I still wanted help. By that time I was fatigued, so I declined.

That’s when I came up with this question. At that moment I would’ve loved to just walk into a place and talk to a counselor on-call. Not days or weeks of waiting to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist, nor being committed to a psych ward. Just real people with crises that they need help with.

Helplines, in my personal opinion, aren’t the same type of treatment. I’ve only tried a couple though, so I’m not entirely certain on it. Though, in some cases, slight medication intervention might be necessary, and personally I prefer a face-to-face conversation.

Im not as valuable or as important as men. Just an object/ baby making machine. I’ll never be seen as a human or worth anything. 

It kills me knowing how women in other countries are treated. Some cant go to school or have control over their own bodies. 

I have to carry sprays and weapons with me if i wanna go for a quick walk around my neighborhood cuz sm stuff happens and i dont feel safe. 

I’ll never be as respected as a man. I’ll never be as strong as men are. I have no way of protecting myself, im just weak and pathetic and it makes me want to scream and cry 

I hate everything. I hate my life so much i dont want to be here anymore",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1am2rtm/i_hate_being_a_woman_to_the_point_its_ruining_my/,mentalhealth

I called the 988 hotline ,"I called the 988 hotline, they hung up twice, I finally talked to a lady and she was really condescending, I tried telling her how they hung up on me and she said “well that’s not me, I didn’t hang up, so why are you complaining to me?” So I just let it go, I tried to talk out what was going on with me, she said “I’m a 37 year old black woman, you’re a 22 year old white girl, don’t you think I have it hard? Do you think it makes us feel good to listen to you complain? It could be worse” 
I just sat in shock. Like I completely understand the sentiment, I know being black gives you a disadvantage, but what on gods green earth would make her think that would make me feel better? No shit it could be worse, it could always be worse, that doesn’t change how I feel. Idk it just really bothered me, my whole issue was I felt like nobody hears me or cares to listen, and it just didn’t help at all. I just hung up and started crying.

All trauma is trauma!,"**All trauma is trauma.**  


To the brain, anything that is traumatic, or causes hurt or pain, is trauma.  


There is no gauge to say how severe a trauma is.  


Don't invalidate your trauma just because you think that it is not as severe as someone else's trauma. It doesn't work like that.  


All trauma is valid. All trauma is trauma.  


There are so many different types of trauma.  


Emotional neglect with a parent working too much during your childhood.  
Physically abused by a parent.  


Both examples above are trauma to the brain.  


But .. regardless of the trauma, you are not broken. You deserve the same amount of love, joy and happiness as everyone else. And you can get it.  


Stop telling yourself that you are not whole, that you're not worthy and drserving. Tell yourself the opposite and maybe you start to finally believe it.  


Maybe you were emotionally abused or physically abused .. and you have been telling yourself every since that you don't deserve love and affection. And now? .. you believe it right? This is your story. Well, change the story. Identify the story that you've been telling yourself, find the lies in the story .. and make up a new one, a truthful one.

The power of walking,"  

..I saw somewhere on reddit, an advice on going for walks when feeling down.

After a breakup in late January, being a couch potato in the beginning, where I have been feeling like my lowest ever. Feeling sad, depressed, lonely and hurt like hell. While at the same time, going nuts from working from home, and not seeing anyone. Fuck this pandemic, right??! 

I decided, 13-14th Feb-ish to just go for a short walk, every day. Because… fuck it what else is there to do.

I usually walked 20-30 minutes each day at first. Then the last 4-5 days I walked around hour. First it was just a nice break from being stuck indoor. But I have started feeling happier ever since I started walking. I don’t feel like giving up on life as much as I did not long ago. I even feel like smiling to strangers on my walk now... Yeah, I’m weird like that.

But today I walked 13km!! (8Miles, I think) my feet hurt, but I feel amazing, and kind of proud I did it. Also, I really need to get some wireless headphones… wanted to chew that wire to pieces several times today. I still feel lonely, and missing my ex. But one day at a time, I guess.

Seriously, go for a walk.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/lsahwz/the_power_of_walking/,mentalhealth

Tonight we sat and cried together. I forgot I had the power to help people even when I’m sad. Words aren’t always necessary.,"In my family we don’t talk much.

Tonight was a rough night. As per usual I was sat alone in my crying and melting into my mattress. When my mom came in I didn’t bother looking up at her and just growled a classic’ go away’ in response. 

She asked to borrow one of my books and I peeled myself off my bed to grab it. It was only when I went to tell her to leave did I actually bother to look at her. She looked like she had blown her noise a few times and her eyes were watery. This was maybe the second or third time in my entire life I’d seen this happen and I forgot how shellshocking it was to see your numbed parent like that. 

This lead to a short uncomfortable conversation of me asking if she was okay. We didn’t talk much. Instead I just asked her if she wanted to sit on the couch with me and watch a movie. I got her a blanket and some tissues. The whole movie we just sat there, at first crying and just holding hands by the end.

I still don’t know what happened to make her so sad. She knew better than to dig into my pile of mental issues. But when the movie was over she hugged me and said “thank you. this is the happiest I’ve been in a while. I needed this.” 

It really took me out of my own bullshit for a moment to realize I had done something good just by being there. And she had done the same for me in a way. I could tell we just both felt cared for by the end and in my house that goes a long way. 

Don’t forget how powerful small things are. Or that the people around you are often suffering too. You don’t need to be in perfect or even good shape to be the support someone needs.

Maybe the last time I hugged my son.,"My 29-year-old son just walked out my door, maybe for the last time. He came to see me for the last time until this is over. My kids have all seen me cry many many times, I have suffered major depression my whole life and crying is just part of it for me. But I don't know if I've ever let them see me quite the way I was today, it was like all the horror and dread I have felt in the last few years, the loss of my mother, and our current situation just exploded. He broke the social distance we are trying to observe to hug me because I couldn't stop sobbing. So he left to go home and I have no doubt that if he gets sick, and many of us are going to get sick, he will die. My kind, smart, funny, loving, dependable, hardworking, handsome, disliked by no one, loved by all, talented son with 5 serious respiratory conditions. He has siblings and nieces and nephews and we cannot survive losing him.

Last month I attempted suicide for the 4th time. Today I was promoted a week into my new job. It does get better.,"I have struggled with mental illness my entire life. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as a child, depression at 14, ADHD at 16, and bipolar disorder at 20. The first time I seriously considered suicide was when I was 10. Needless to say, it’s been rough.

The pandemic hit me especially hard. In June I quit my job of 6 years due to the effect it was having on my mental health. I was supposed to work at a summer camp in July anyways, but the governor decided the day before I was supposed to start that residential camps would not be running this year. Due to me quitting my previous job I wasn’t eligible for unemployment, so I was no longer able to afford a therapist or my medication.

I found a new job in July but my mental health had declined to the point where I was completely unable to do it. It also involved driving to a different facility every day, which would cause me to vomit with anxiety before every shift. After having a panic attack over parking in Boston, I ghosted them and decided that this was the end for me. I couldn’t do something as simple as sit and stare at a pool for 8 hours, even if the alternative was an empty bank account and a rising self-hatred. How would I ever be able to function independently?

That night I attempted to hang myself. Obviously, it didn’t work, and I’m still here. This frustrated me; I felt like such a failure that I couldn’t even succeed in dying. I ended up relapsing with self harm, and I spent the weeks after that consuming any substance I could get my hands on to numb the pain, waiting for the courage to try again.

After the very much warranted disappointment from my parents, I ended up applying for an overnight warehouse job for an online retailer. From the rumors I’d heard I expected it to suck, but they were right, I needed a job.

They hired me, and I started last week. Turns out it doesn’t suck. And I don’t suck at the job either. Within three days they asked me to apply for a promotion, and today I got a fancy new vest, my shift differential was bumped up by $1.50, and I finally have some hope for the future. I also found out if I stay for a year they can help pay for my education, so for the first time in forever I have a long-term plan for my future. Best of all, I can afford to get help again.

I know I’m going to feel shitty again, but it’s going to get better again after that. I have trouble remembering times like these when I’m really going through it, but for the first time in years I feel capable. I feel like I can take it. I’m a hard worker and I’m no quitter, why would I give up on life like that?

I guess my point is that no matter how dark it seems, how hopeless it feels, or how incompetent you think you are, there’s always a chance for it to get better. I’m moreso making this post to look back on the next time I’m suicidal, but I’m hoping my message will help others a little.

"For the first time in my life, I talked with a professional about this and was told that I was downright abused and it's like a weight has been lifted off - It wasn't my fault. I wasn't a troubled kid.","\*\*\* please read the edit \*\*\*

For a brief moment in my life from ages 15 to the summer before I turned 17, I lived with my dad and his girlfriend. My dad was a passive, quiet guy that wasn't around much. He didn't want custody, but accepted to take me and my brother who was 12 at the time to live with him while my mom was in Europe taking care of someone. The whole situation was odd. This woman, let's call her C, had an 11 year old son and was not happy about two more kids being added onto her plate. My dad promised we were no trouble and that I was old enough not to need babysitting.

I was rebellious, like most 15 year olds. I was energetic, popular, and sporty. I had just broken up with my boyfriend, and I was just starting high school. Things are already horrible, and to add a stranger to the mix was ever more shitty. After we moved out and went back to live with my mother, I was never the same person. I told my therapist that I wanted to go back to that 15 year old girl again. I was so happy and fun. He asked me to describe when things changed, and this all came up...

This woman legit abused me, and nobody said anything. Nobody defended me, and I blamed myself. I thought I was troubled, that I was difficult, that it was my fault, that my dad didn't like me.

I bleached the lower part of my hair and colored it hot pink. When she found out, she dragged me to the bathroom and locked the door and stood in front of it. She didn't let me out until I cut the parts I had bleached. My hair went from almost above my bra to shoulder length. It looked horrible too. All the while, this large woman with shaved tattooed eyebrows stood behind me and yelled at me.

*Your father will blame me for this! What an idiot! I should just make you cut it all off! Either you do it or I'll do it for you!*

I clearly remember shaking and cutting my hair. She made me clean the bathroom, explain to my dad that I had made a mess of my hair and had to do this and apologize for it.

She convinced my dad not to let me go on a 3-day school trip because she thought I must be grounded for a month because I had stolen her wifi password. Her stupid 0000 wifi password. She said that I couldn't be trusted, and how could my dad let me go on this trip? So, I was grounded and not allowed to go - and I was the ONLY freshman not there.

She took my phone and only gave it back when I called my mom crying about it and she had to have a fight with dad from across the world. Finally, my dad decided my phone was out of the question.

The worst thing, aside from the hair, was when my friends and I decided to go to a party when I was 16. We got ready at our place, and were just leaving when she stopped us yelling and screaming.

*Why would you think it's ok to leave my house looking like a whore? get back here!*

And then she dragged me back to the house and pushed me to my room, legit attacked me and took off my clothes and made me wipe off my make-up and change into something else. My friends were frozen out of fear, I came out looking beaten (she didn't actually hit me, though) and miserable and crying. I just told them to just go - and we all ran out of that house. I was humiliated. I wanted to die. My friends didn't know what to do. One of them asked if she always treated me like that. ""What a bitch""

That night, she came into my room to let me know she only did that because she cares about my dad and what he thinks of her. Also that she doesn't want her son to see these things at his age!

She did that a lot. Randomly talking to me about what a great person she was and how wise she was. Once she sat me down to tell me I was acting out and that she knew I was a good girl deep down, but trying to fight her and that it was natural. She made me feel crazy and ungrateful. She would play the victim constantly. My dad was barely there, much like before, but when he was - he was yelling at me because she'd told him I was nothing but trouble.

She broke my spirit. I was too tired to fight her. I gave up fighting her, I just legit gave up. When I told these to my therapist, he said that abuse is exactly like this. They close a door on you, but don't teach you how to open another one... so you're just lost. I needed someone to love me, to pay attention, to tell me I was doing a good job getting straight A's in school. Instead, I got constant yelling and criticism and guilt.

I'm 26 years old now... and I've just realized what this monster has done to me. She's the reason my life is miserable now. I wasn't a bad kid. I wasn't a trouble maker. I was just a teenager, and this woman made it her mission to break me and she did. My dad never married her, and I have no idea what's happened to her. I've also never told my mom. I mean, she knew that I was having ""trouble"" but I never told her my side of the story.

I don't know how I'm going to overcome this, but I'm done feeling like the victim. I now know why I'm no longer happy and care-free and energetic. I know exactly when things changed. I'm the same person, I just had a door closed on my face and nobody showed me how to open another one. I'm gonna build one and walk through it now. Fuck you, C. I hope you get what you deserve. I'm sure she kept telling herself she was being ""responsible"" or that was her job - but all she had to do was NOT ruin some kid's life.

IMPORTANT EDIT: I just need to say this, since this is getting some reads... Please please please if you just don't feel good - that doesn't necessarily mean sad or angry, it could just be ""out of it"" - try and find the reason for it. I've tried for years. I've been in therapy since I was 17, and I started cutting myself. I used to think it was because of guys, or because of my parents' divorce, or because of x and y and... I only realized what this was all about when I told my therapist that the last time I was truly happy was when I was 15. He made me write about every single year of my life, and we went through it like a TV show and figured out what exactly happened. I didn't even think of this woman for much of my adult life. But now, everything's a lot clearer. So - just please talk to someone. Write. Writing is incredible, and it doesn't even cost anything. But if you write and talk to someone who knows what to look for - that's what matters.

Growing up I didnt have any problems with mental health. I was raised southern Baptist, worked on cars with my dad while still in diapers. When I could walk I learned home improvement, drywall, painting, ect. I was raised to be strong, protect my sisters and my mom. I was raised that men dont cry, men dont hurt. I grew up thinking that I had to be strong in all moments and never let down my guard. 

Fast forward to 2 years ago. I was driving home on the not so good side of town very very late at night when I saw a guy leaning in the window of a car. (Drug deals not uncommon out in the open) He turned away from the car and jerked violently before falling down onto the street. I slammed my car to a stop, threw up the brake and jumped out, not knowing what was happening. 

I always carry a firearm on me and had it on my side. I approached the male laying on the ground when the guys from the car he was leaning in opened their door. When they stood up the only thing I remember seeing was the barrel of their gun. Couldn't tell you what they looked like, what color the car was, hell even if it was a guy or a girl. I pulled my weapon when I saw this and we both paused for what felt like hours, days. I wasnt breathing. We just started at each other while I was aimed dead in that person's chest. 

I didnt pull the trigger.

The person jumped back in their car and sped off after what seemed like an eternity and I holstered my weapon and ran to the guy in the street. He was shot in the lower left of his back, blood pumping out of a small circle wound. Holding pressusre on it with one hand and trying to dial 911 with the other I tried to stop and much bleeding as possible. After hanging up with 911 the wait began. 

I took my jacked off and laid it under him. (With it being cold out and him losing blood you want to keep his core as warm as possible. Help arrived almost exactly 1 hour later. My hand had frozen, literally frozen to this mans skin in a frozen seal of blood. 

Greg was his first name and he made a full recovery.

I moved on from that day different. Over the course of the next year I would have night terrors of the image of that gun, the blood pumping out of his skin, being alone with him desperately trying to keep him alive. I couldn't be in public with out my heart racing and having to leave. I didnt trust new people I was meeting. I was scared to be alone at any times. It came to a head when I tried to end everything. 

With out going into it to much I didnt. I went straight to family for help and explained everything. My mom took me in, I found a therapist that I enjoyed and got put on a medication to calm the terrors. The first time I talked to the therapist I cried. I cried and cried for the first time in my life. Cried like a baby and let all the manly machismo go. I was vulnerable and she held me through it. She understood and didnt judge. She saved me.

One year of therapy later I have a totally different outlook on mental health. After reading through this sub I figured this story could help someone. It is okay for men to hurt. It doesnt make you less of a man to be struggling with something. It is okay to break down and not have the solutions. 

Please, if you are someone who thinks you will be judged negatively for having ""something wrong"" or being broken in some way, there is help. I am forever grateful I found help when I did.

Sorry if the story is kinda rushed or mistyped, kinda a hard subject to bring up.

I'm sick of therapists using CBT where it isn't helpful,"I'm getting really sick of people who are all about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Positive Psychology and think having a positive attitude is the end all be all of mental health treatment. There are many people who benefit from this type of therapy, don't get me wrong, but the people who are suffering most often see it as writing them off. If you are deep in poverty, in an abusive relationship, jobless, homeless, or preoccupied with messages from voices you hear, these methods do not work. Therapists need to take this into account when working with people who fit into these categories, but also initially with all patients. There should be an understanding that people aren't very open at first in therapy in general and could have any of these things going on and not tell you. Simply saying you need to change your thoughts doesn't work. People may be in situations where their thoughts are about real problems they need to face every day. I understand trying to make it easier for that person and that is what you think you're doing, but really you are just making your job easier. You, as a therapist, would be much better off starting with asking what kind of therapy someone is looking for and describing the different forms if necessary. Different forms fit different people and I'm sick of CBT being the gold standard. 

It really makes my blood boil when I hear someone say their therapist doesn't listen, and most of the time it's because they are trying to use CBT and Positive Psychology where they don't belong. Sometimes life really is hard for that person, and trying to get them to think differently about it is an exercise in futility. People are often quietly in crisis, and I see these approaches as inherently dismissive of this fact. 

I hope someone sees this and knows they can advocate to their therapist for something different, because I have had to multiple times and it is not easy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/nwmpz1/im_sick_of_therapists_using_cbt_where_it_isnt/,mentalhealth

"""Leave your personal life at the door"" is so inhumane","Has anyone else heard/been told this before in the context of working? One of my bosses said this recently (about another employee why was having a rough time and wanted to go home) and I think it's so crazy. 

Anyone else think it's callous, cruel, and inhumane; to just expect a human being to stop being a human being when they get to work? It's *so* fucked up to me. That's just not how it works and that's not how we should be expected to behave and that's not what we should expect of each other. So someone isn't feeling good, so they want to go home early.

My husband went into psychosis. I’m not ok,"On Wednesday my husband got violent with me. He’s never done so. I quickly realized it’s what I’ve fear, he went into full blown psychosis. I called all the closest people in his life and they came over and stayed so I wasn’t alone. He was okay with it and told me he needed help, to please help him. We started off going to a voluntary inpatient. He was in the waiting room and it was going well, until he broke. He threatened everyone there and stripped down naked. At that point they called some firefighters to take him to a regular hospital to make sure there were no drugs in his system. There weren’t. He was okay in the hospital as well, until he wasn’t. He got super angry and scared, which is understandable. But he threatened everyone there as well. I know that’s not my husband. But he continued to threaten me and told me he’s going to kill me and that he’s the devil. At that point I had to leave the room, I was legitimately scared for my life. Now we’re at the point where he might have to go to a court ordered treatment. I’m so so scared for him and wish I could take him home but there’s no way I can without getting really hurt or dying. I know treatment facilities aren’t great. But please someone tell it’s okay what I had to do. I really hope I see my real husband again, and when I do I hope he forgives me for leaving that hospital room when he threatened to kill me and “make me feel loved”. I’m not okay, he’s not okay.

The popular saying to “follow your heart/instincts/inner voice” is only helpful for those who have a proven track record of a healthy internal thought process. At 35 I’m learning that for me this is bad advice and I found that helpful to me to understand i interpret the world differently than most.,"You know that cliche advice to listen to your heart or follow your heart when making life choices? I feel like for me that is bad advice. My whole life when I do this I find this was not positive for me (relationships, jobs, etc). 

My immediate family has several people who either meet the criteria or some of the criteria for personality disorders. My whole life I’ve noticed that when I follow my “heart” or listen to my heart I am usually wrong. 

I have a habit of I misinterpreting behaviors of others and irrationally take small things as a personal attack on me which is insane. I think this is rooted in my insecurities and deep down I believe everyone is out to get me or be mean to me. 

unlike most people I should NOT follow my heart and actually use logic and talking to someone who is more objective than I am in any given situation. 

I actually wish sometimes movies or people give this advice should say “unless you struggle with your mental health and can’t trust your inner voice”. Does anyone else feel that way?",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/dff5o6/the_popular_saying_to_follow_your/,mentalhealth
I think I have PTSD from my wife giving birth.,"Let me start with I know that what a woman goes through in labor is incredibly hard and challenging on them both mentally and physically. 

So my wife got induced Friday morning and things progressed fine all day. They gave her an epidural at 4PM Friday and things were good. Around midnight the baby’s heart rate dropped which caused my wife’s to drop.. 

We had every nurse on the floor in our room in seconds. They flipped her on hands and knees, woke the on-site surgeon and started prepping the OR and a crash team. They got her and the baby stabilized in about 15 min. So that was at midnight. 

She labored through until it caused too much stress on her body so they sedated her and put her on oxygen for a few hours around 4 AM Saturday. She progressed to a little over 9cm. 

Around 9:30AM Saturday she gradually stopped having contractions and essentially going backwards.

 They ended having to doing an emergency c section at 11ish. 

When the baby came out he wasn’t breathing and didn’t for the first 5 min. They had to resuscitate him all the while they had a hard time stopping my wife’s bleeding. So. Much. Blood…. It was all over.. The drs discovered some infection while they had her opened up and had to look for more infection which took them longer. I watched them pull my wife’s insides out asking for help with the bleeding and the NICU nurses flip my child’s lifeless body around to get him breathing. 

So I bounced around the operating room  between my wife and child checking on them for like 20 minutes being completely helpless. 

Both baby and mama have gotten the all clear and are at home recovering. No immediate issues with either of them.  I know it’s silly to be upset because we came home and are doing okay when so many people don’t get that opportunity. I just can’t get the OR out of my head. It’s playing over and over. Very vividly… 

Let me close with… I firmly believe nurses are a GOD SEND and I plan on seeking professional help this week. Just needed to vent.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/191qstp/i_think_i_have_ptsd_from_my_wife_giving_birth/,mentalhealth
My friend died by suicide. Please listen to her wisdom & help me honor her.,"“On July 23, 2020, Annika passed on from this life. She fought for her life, and this wasn't the first time.

She was a warrior. She exuded warmth and light. She saved my life.

I have suffered from OCD, anxiety, and depression for 9 years. It has taken so much from me, but this loss was particularly cruel.

I believe I am speaking through Annika when I ask you to please stay. Please fight for your life. You matter. I love you. It does get better. I have been on medical leave of absence many times, I have seen more than a dozen providers, and I have given up on my biggest dream. I am also first-generation, and I have experienced the stigma surrounding mental illness in my community firsthand. But in this particular moment, I feel peace and love. I could not have imagined that on my darkest day. Your fight is valid and you are strong; please reject anything that suggests otherwise. Please take strength from Annika's words and my journey. Please carry on with the hope that she instilled in me. This life can still be beautiful for you.

And now, I ask that you please help me honor this beautiful soul.

Annika said, 'I admired and adored \[Avril Lavigne\] so much when I was a teenager, her music literally saved me back then.' She had a ticket for Avril’s concert in Germany—it would have been her second time—but it was cancelled due to COVID.

Abuse [trigger warning],"My dad wanted to sleep with me.
He made me chat with adults on the internet. He pretended that I was his sister. He talked about threesomes with me and strangers. He justified it to himself. He got off to these fantasies, under a blanket, thinking I didn't notice.

He laid on the couch with me. He asked if I was too warm, and if I wanted to take off my clothes. I said no. He touched my stomach and told me I was soft. He told me I was beautiful, that I had a soft back. He asked if I wanted to take off me clothes. I said no. It felt like forever before he gave up.

I will never forgive that betrayal.

I will never forgive him for putting these thoughts and these abnormal fantasies in my head.

And now that I've told the internet, I can tell my psychologist. I need to tell her. I think I can.

Is it rude to tell people my dad died by suicide?,"My dad used a handgun and ended his life recently. I’ve found myself having to tell people my dad died a lot, but I am increasingly wanting to be honest with how it happened.

This feels important to me. If we are more open about suicide, about mental health, maybe fewer dads or siblings or friends will die this way.

Why are people like this allowed to be psychiatrists?,"I went to a psychiatrist for the first time today. I had quite high hopes because he has an incredible reputation and lots of good reviews online. I was sent there by my psychologist because she couldn't quite figure out what was wrong with me.

I had prepared quite well for the appointment, I had brought a list of the maybe-diagnoses my psychologist had given me and the corresponding symptoms. (For context: she diagnosed a medium depression, depersonalisation- and derealization syndrome, hallucinations and possibly psychosis)

When I said I brought a list, he said he'd rather I tell him about it myself. Fair enough, I tried to. He interrupted me before I could get into the second diagnosis on my list, telling me not to use words like ""depersonalisation"" for myself. Those words are for people that are really sick, not people like me. 

He kept asking me what my boyfriend does and if he's mentally stable, if I'm happy with him. The appointment was supposed to last an hour, we were done in 15 minutes because he didn't ask me anything about me. He dismissed everything I said I was experiencing, he said I was making myself more sick than I actually was. He said I was a really sensitive, frail person and I shouldn't use medical terms to describe my symptoms. 

He ended the appointment with a well-loved classic, I need to go on runs, it works just as well as an anti-depressant! I have chronic back issues and am not supposed to run. I told him that and got the ""stop making yourself more sick than you are, you're young and healthy"" speech again.

I'm so exhausted, that was such a terrible appointment and I feel so stupid now. I'll never go there again.

Going ""uwu I'm so sad all the time look at me I'm a sad boy aren't I dreamy and mysterious"" takes all of the gravity out of how it feels to be depressed. These people probably have no clue what it feels like to fight the urge to cut your arms and legs clean open, how it feels to have to smile at people and play the happy person when you're in constant agony, because you can't tell them how you really feel without being a ""downer"" or being told to ""chill out"". I would love to chill out. I would love to not be a downer, I would love not to drag the people I know down with me when I'm not doing well, I would love to have a reason to live that isn't ""live long enough to see this band come to town in 5 months"".

Mental illness isn't pretty. Mental illness isn't an aesthetic choice. Being depressed doesn't make you cute or quirky or unique. It hurts you, it tears you limb from limb on the inside, and thanks to people that treat it like a cutesy instagram aesthetic, very few take it seriously.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/dp8hga/my_depression_is_not_an_aesthetic_its_not_cute_to/,mentalhealth

"Do you ever feel like you're just so, so starved for human connection","That like even when you're with people, 99 % of the time you're not really there and something in your heart is resisting you from being fully yourself? 

So that you cannot ever fully relax into your being and instead are always as if holding yourself up somewhere outside of your body, always psychically hanging on a ledge of fear?

That Even when you're on your own and can be yourself youre still not really ""your self?""

This is how ive felt for as long as i can remember. The times when it didn't feel this way in my life have been as few and far between as sunshine on a cloudy day.

I feel fucked up somehow, like this isn't what human life is supposed to feel like. I can't imagine why human beings would exist to feel this way. It feels criminal.

The only times that I feel OK are when I'm stoned, like right now. And - rarely- when very comfortable with friends in a loving home environment. I never felt like this once while I was living with my parents.

I gave up a lot to feel better, I even quit my job and left everything behind on a spiritual journey, and yet after a lot of (enjoyable) adventures I still feel the same. Like life is just a movie playing in front of my eyes, as though a dream which I have no will over. I never felt in control of my life, really. I have always been along for the ride of whatever my impulses tell me. Sometimes they boss me in positive directions and sometimes negative but at the end of the day I still feel like I'm only holding on to the reins of my life which is living itself. I don't stand up for myself when verbally attacked, I just go silent and dumb. I've never been able to release myself completely to romantic love, just half way, never committing to anything that concrete, just like I've lived my life.

I don't know why I'm posting this, it's just a strange little thing, that now I finally feel okay, because I'm stoned, that this would come out. That a healthier part of my is crying out for some help because it's never expressed and always imprisoned behind this sort of crystalline, blurred window that seperates me from the life around me.

it may only have been minor to start with, but I am now in intensive psychotherapy and have in short lost my fucking mind to a certain extent. enough ranting I apologize

Does anyone else just want to sleep to escape reality,"My first post on Reddit. (39M)

I have always been of strong character and hard working, people who know me would say I'm life and soul, funny, intelligent and strong. Recently though I've found myself slipping into a routine of staying up late and sleeping all day and being lazy. I cocoon myself in my duvet and wrap a pillow around my head and try to sleep as long as possible. I can wake momentarily and remember my dreams quite vividly (they are always enjoyable happy dreams) I can then just remember the dream and slip back into them. 

It's like I'm addicted to my dreams and as soon as I wake I try and try to enter back into that world. Sometimes I'm successful but after 12 hours sadly I am in the real world. 

I am in danger of losing my job because of this now which worries me even more. It's quite apparent that I must be depressed. I have so much to be grateful for but it appears the big D has taken over my life. Can I regain my normal life? This is the first time I've ever spoke about it to anyone, probably the wrong place to seek help, I have no idea.

"High schools need therapists and real resources for suicidal students, not just non-suicide contracts","First time posting here, please don’t mind the rambly-ness of this. Today I was thinking about something that happened years ago that made me realize schools don’t do much about suicidal students. 

When I was in high school I was severely depressed and going through a really difficult time in my life due to my parents divorce, particularly after being sent to live with my neglectful and abusive dad. I was self harming, battling an eating disorder, and was barely sleeping at night. I was absolutely struggling pretty clearly on the outside. I had a teacher tease me for looking so miserable at school every day and I got in trouble for being inattentive or dozing off in classes among my high-achieving peers. It was a rough time. 

I remember changing a password to something I accessed at school to iwannadie. It must have been flagged because I was sent to my guidance counselor, who really only ever gave people advice and help with applying to college, and she basically got me in trouble and threatened to tell my parents, and made me sign a contract that I wouldn’t kill myself. It totally cured me of all depression and I was never suicidal again! /s

Anyway, it upsets me that they didn’t do anything more about this. They didn’t mention it to my parents or anyone else, they never followed up again, and didn’t have a therapist or a professional to refer me to, in school or out. 

Schools need to have a resource for students. I was so vulnerable and depressed and I was shamed for it rather than helped. Guidance counselors don’t really have time for this, which is understandable, but they MUST have someone else there to support students during tough times if that’s the case.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bs77u9/high_schools_need_therapists_and_real_resources/,mentalhealth

Dear mentally stable people: I’m not lazy!,"I’m posting this here because I just want to know if anyone else feels this way. I’m not lazy! I know it looks like I’m lazy. I sleep all day, I never join the family to eat or watch a movie, I spend all of my time in my room. I failed my classes, although I used to get straight A’s. I never go out anymore, I haven’t hung out with any of my friends in months. I don’t even walk my dogs. Or at least that’s just what it looks like right?

I’m not lazy. I hate it here. I’m miserable, my mind is in constant pain. Everything feels so heavy and difficult. Why do I have to participate in a life that just causes me so much pain? Why do I have to get a job, when doing so causes a massive downward spiral in my mental health? Why do I need to keep going to school when it makes me feel totally and utterly filled with dread and fear? Other people want me here more than I do. 

I feel like most people are given a shiny, fun, new toy, and some of us are given old dusty broken shit from the thrift store. And they wonder why we won’t just “play with it, live a little, have fun! Be happy with what you’ve got! Enjoy it!”  Like, I’m sorry for hating it. I’m sorry for hating my life. I’m sorry my brain doesn’t do shiny, fun, cool things, and it resembles the broken toy a bit more. People who have never experienced serious mental health issues have no idea what it’s like for us. If their toy gets a scratch, they can polish it. My toy is way too broken to even bother trying to polish it. It’s so invalidating and exhausting to even exist near people who don’t understand because I can feel the constant judgement. 

When normal people feel sad, they can watch a movie or call a friend to cheer themselves up. And it genuinely works for them. I can’t escape the brokenness of my mind even when I’m “happy”. It’s always there, and I can always feel it no matter what. Lately, the weight has been too heavy to bear. So I know it looks like it, but I promise I’m not lazy.

I got sexually assaulted 2 hours ago and my parents blame me for it [F19],"On a 1-hour ride in a crowded bus an older man kept touching my breast and offering me money after I repeatedly refused and raised my voice and tried to protect myself. The bus was so crowded I couldn't get away from him. Everyone noticed and did NOTHING said NOTHING. Other older man started watching and seemed entertained. I live in a third world country. After the man got off the bus some people started talking that it was very disturbing what he did  but NO ONE did NOTHING to stop it.

I got home crying and told my parents what happened. They blame me and tell me that it's because of the way I dressed. That I deserved it for not dressing appropriately. That it was my fault. I was dressed In a short large dress with no cleavege (I'm petite) and it's not even a dress, the skirt part is actually shorts.

I was trying to explain how miserable I am but they kept interrupting me, shouting ""you should have done that, that"". I told them about another situations that happened 4 years ago where I was also sexually assaulted in public. But that time I was dressed with a lot of clothes. They told me my fault that time was that I didn't scream or say anything. So again it's my fault. 

!!!!! They said that it's my fault that he thought I was a hooker (this hurts SO much my heart aches)

It's my fault for what happened today implying that I deserve it.

There are no words to describe how I am feeling right now. I am a very sensitive person in general and a lot of things affect me deeply.

I am crying my heart out right now in the corner of a dark room praying for someone in this world who would come right now to give me a hug and actually listen to me and understand me. I want to overcome this (I have 1 week until uni starts, idk how I'm gonna do that) but at the same time I cannot believe these are MY parents and this is what they told me and think of me. 

I am so traumatized and crying incontrollably right now that I feel like I'm gonna explode. I feel betrayed and unprotected. 

*The point for this post is that I DO NOT want to go mentally insane from everything that happened. I do not want to wake up one day in the mental hospital. My mental state is very shaky right now. Please help me , I don't know how but please help me. I don't want to lose my health*

"I tried so hard to love this country, but after all of the racism and indifference I’ve faced, I’m happy I can finally leave.","I’m from an Indian (India not Native American) family. They were born in India, but I was born here in the United States. I’ve lived here in the Southeast for my whole life. I’ve always faced so much racism. I’ve been called a terrorist for my skin color more times than I can remember. 

The media so often uses us as the butt of jokes (looking at you Disney Channel) and even some politicians do too. Joe Biden made a joke about Indians being gas station owners (my parents are lawyers with American accents). Nobody cares though. I’m just expected to suck it up. 

I tried so hard to look at the bright side. To look at how much opportunity and financial success this country has provided, and that is something I will always be very grateful for. I tried so hard to love this nation, but I just can’t. I’ve been told to “go home” by some people. Despite being born here and living here my whole life, I’ll never be seen as a true American. 

Despite that I just can’t stand it any more. It’s not the racism so much, but the indifference and invalidation. That’s the real depressive thing. 

Anyway, this isn’t to say that all Americans are like this. I’ve met plenty of fantastic ones who understand and sympathize, but there are just too many of the bad apples in this country for me to want to stay. 

I was lucky enough to intern in, and get a full time job in London. I’m so ecstatic to move there. The fact that I’m ethnically Indian won’t be my defining factor there like it is here. At least there I’ll be “the American” and not “the Indian.” 

Systemic Barriers like racial preferences in college admissions don’t exist at top universities like they do here. I went to college at UVA, and while it was leagues better than high school in terms of overt racism, the invalidation and indifference of overt racism toward ethnic Indians was still 100% there. So if I have kids, they’ll grow up in a country where their skin color isn’t their defining factor. 

I don’t mean to offend anyone with this soapbox. If you’re an American who gets what I’m saying, then thank you, and I am grateful that people like you exist.

Our breakup was a long time coming, it just unfortunately happened at a really bad time).

November through January was the most difficult time of my life. I struggled so so much. I think I had so much trauma from that time, that I literally cannot remember a single thing from those two and a half months. I just remember this constant feeling of numbness and having a breakdown every couple of days. I missed my ex-boyfriend and I missed my best friend so so much. Somehow I've lost my two best friends, the two most important people in my life only eight days apart. It was awful. 

I'm doing much much better now. I've made new friends, I've kissed new boys, I'm going to social events with my friends (Covid is currently under control in my country, don't worry xx). I've realized that breaking up with my now ex-boyfriend was one of the best things I've EVER done for myself. Please don't get me wrong, he's a phenomenal person with a beautiful heart. I still have so much love for him, but we weren't meant to be together in the long run, and I've realized that now. Our relationship became toxic, not because either of us were toxic individuals, but because we weren't good for each other anymore. 

As for my best friend... Zara my beautiful beautiful angel. I miss you every day, but I know how much pain you were in. This world didn't deserve you, sunflower-child. I still feel you everywhere around me. I feel you when the sun hits my back when I'm laughing with my friends at school, I feel you when I'm making out with younger boys on golf courses and I know you would've approved. I feel you around me when I'm drinking beers with my boys and dancing with my girls.  You're always around, I know it!

I miss you so much, but I know you're in a place where you're happy, and that you're finally at a place where you don't have pain and where you can truly be yourself. I love you, you selfless and kind person.


To the people who read this post, I truly hope that you are doing well. I wish you the best. I just really needed to write my feelings out and hit post. To send it into the universe. Please remember that things do get better ♡

All my love

I just survived a murder attempt by my own mother and i need help,"Hello everyone,  
  
I'm a 20-year-old woman from Newcastle, UK, and I'm reaching out for help. When I was 16, I moved to the UK with my mother from Poland, and since then, life has been a constant struggle.  
  
My father left us when I was young, and I haven't had any contact with him for years. My mother's severe mood swings resemble extreme bipolar episodes, but she refuses to seek any help, making my life even harder.  
  
Last year, I was prescribed Roaccutane for my acne, and things took a turn for the worse. Due to COVID, my doctor increased my dose without necessary blood tests, and I became extremely ill. My mother's refusal to pay for my treatment made things worse, and I was suicidal, but I managed to hang on.  
  
Yesterday, my mother had her worst episode yet. While drunk, she threatened me and got very close. Terrified for my safety, I locked the door behind her when she went outside to smoke. Shockingly, she set the garden on fire, knowing it would spread to the house and harm me.  
  
I called the police, and my mother is now in custody. I'm completely alone, with no support, money, or idea of how to move forward. I can't work or study because of my condition.  
  
I'm in desperate need of help and feeling hopeless and ill. i don't know how to survive financially and rebuild after my mother attempt to kill me. I need support

“Maybe I should suicide myself?”,"Those are the words of my 9 year old son. Words he spoke the other day because he misses his 17 year old cousin who died by suicide 16 months ago. He wants to see her. Words I now carry with me every moment of every day. 

I was there that morning. I arrived right after the police. It was like a scene in a movie. Emergency lights flashed from every direction. I left my car in the middle of the road, door open, pushed past all the police in the street, and ran into the house. 

Looking back on that day I can see myself as if I was watching from above. My sister and her husband were inconsolable.  Police everywhere. The screams, and tears. All the phone calls. It’s such a blur. But what is clear are the moments I was able to sit with her before she was taken away. The quiet in her room was deafening. I wanted it all to stop. I wanted to turn back the clock. To have one more chance. As I sat there the realization hit me like wave. Everything had changed. I couldn’t stop it. Nothing would ever be the same again. My niece... she was gone. 

It’s been sixteen months and no one has “moved on”.  It’s something we carry with us every day. It’s part of all of us. That loss, the grief, the anger and disbelief. It makes every step harder to make and every breath harder to take. 

My niece was in pain. Blinding pain. I sat on the front steps that morning and read the note she left. 10 pages of writing as the drugs took effect. She was more afraid of waking up then dying. Those were her exact words!  She was only two months shy of 18, yet she couldn’t see the light her future held. Any hope she had gathered over time had slipped through her fingers. She couldn’t hold on any longer. 

I’m grateful that her pain has stopped but I wish she could have seen or felt the love she was leaving behind. The devastation that has ripped through our family is the result of the tremendous love we all felt for her.  She was our light. She brought so much joy to us all. Yet she struggled to feel any herself. 

Life will never be the same. People tell you that things will get better in time. A big part of me wants to scream that I don’t want everything to be ok because it’s not.  We’re not and never will be. We’re all a mess. My kids still struggle every day.  She was a regular part of their life. She loved them unconditionally and them her. How do you explain why this disease could take her away and why we couldn’t help her.  They are too young to have to deal with anxiety and depression, and loss. 

What I wouldn’t give for another chance to reach her. Knowing the pain she was in crushed my soul. She had the most beautiful heart. If only she could have felt how loved she was. 

If you are struggling with depression or thinking about suicide, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reach out for help. You are not alone. You deserve to feel love and happiness. You might not feel it or see it right now but there are people who care, who see your worth, who understand your pain, and want to help.  You can even confidentially call or text counselors who can help. I posted the link below.

I am one day free of abusive relationships,"So I (27M) moved house yesterday away from my ex girlfriend who was emotionally abusive and controlling since we first started dating 9 years ago and only recently did I realise how bad she actually was. 

We broke up about 6 months ago and have been living together as housemates till now and after finally moving out my sense of relief is so enormous I just want to cry. Even as housemates she was still super controlling and never gave me privacy or respect, she'd burst into my room at random moments without knocking, no matter what I was doing she would sit on my bed uninvited and talk for ages about herself to demand my attention and I was called rude if my replies weren't what she wanted. She'd never let me have a say or input about anything that went into the house, it was all just her decisions and that was final. 

I've just moved into a share house which I was terrified about since I've never lived with anyone else before and my new housemates are really lovely and welcoming and it actually feels like my place aswell. it's a weird feeling not having anyone to ""answer"" to any more but I guess it's the feeling of actual freedom! 

After narcissistic parents who were controlling and emotionally abusive too Its been a weird rough time getting to this point but my healing begins today. And to anyone else that's around these type of people you need to listen to what your heart is telling you, your more important than anyone else, look after and love yourself first!!

I keep thinking “I’d rather die than deal with anything stressful” but I don’t want to actually die.,"I always feel like anything I say or think is “being dramatic” like in dealing with Jeckyl and Hyde in my head.  I worry and stress about things that have happened, will happen, might happen, might not happen, or surely won’t happen.  My day is consumed with these thoughts to the point where I get a migraine, cry it out, hold it in, get mad.... I’ve been on anxiety medication... all of them, off and on for years.  At the point now where I’m too anxious to take anxiety medication because I’m anxious to get side effects.  Backwards I know...  I’ve seen a therapist before but not for awhile.  I always felt like I was bothering them.

But I feel strange for being like this because I am 33, I’m married, have three kids, a house, a job, a nice large family, lots of friends and cousins and a dog etc and there’s no issues... but most days I end my day thinking “I feel like if I just were to die, I wouldn’t have to deal with these feelings anymore, and I’d be free.” And that’s in regards to my irrational worry and negative thoughts that I alone put in my head.  But I don’t want to die.  I’m afraid of dying actually.  

I’ve been fine my entire life except for when I had my second son 11 years ago.  He was born with club foot.  I spent all my maternity leave going to Children’s hospital for castings, surgery, etc. He had an MRI last year and got orthopedics.  He’s fine and happy and healthy.  But since he was born I changed and I’ve developed panic attacks, anxiety, depression, IBS that put me in the ER 4 times, ulcers.  I worry that bad things will happen to me or my kids non stop.  I can’t stop the play button.  

So yes this is kind of venting but I’m at a loss and I try not to talk about this with anything because I feel like I’m being too whiny and dramatic.  Everyone’s response is always your son is fine now, basically get over it.  But I’ve always felt like I had some sort of PTSD (I don’t know if that’s actually what it would be) after my sons situation because I’ve never gotten over what he went through and what I went through mentally and financially because of it.

Any advice on where I should go from here or what I should do... would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/lbsf28/i_keep_thinking_id_rather_die_than_deal_with/,mentalhealth
I Dealt with a Dental Emergency All by Myself,"Basically I’ve been having unbearable tooth pain for a couple weeks. Yesterday I took myself to urgent care (by bus), called a dentist to see me for X-rays the next day (for free despite having no dental insurance), and then I agreed to have my wisdom tooth removed on the spot (scary). Already, my pain is completely gone.



I’m in my (very) late twenties and have never made any kind of appointment for myself without my mom’s help before this due to my extreme anxiety. I have been doing an outpatient psychiatric program for months (which she also got me into) that has been helping me take little steps when I can.



So many of the things I had to do yesterday would’ve completely thrown me just a few weeks ago. I can’t remember ever feeling so competent and independent. I would say a lot of it was purely born of desperation from the pain in my mouth, but I’m proud of myself anyway (and mom is too).

I called a helpline for the first time tonight,"I called the Samaritans (UK) on 116 123 for the first time tonight. 

I spoke to a wonderful volunteer called James. I said I didn't really know how it works and he just said ""It's simple, you talk and I listen"" he reassured me that they can't give advice. They won't tell you not to cut and they won't call the police unless they seriously need to, they also can't see your number. They can simply listen and offer an ear. I spoke calmly about my struggles and my life and he listened for like half an hour. I honestly nearly cried he was so reassuring and spent so long with me even though I wasn't in desperate need. I came away feeling a lot better and promised to call next time i feel like cutting.

I've never called a helpline before as I thought it would be very scripted but he just got me talking about family, my partner, my house and other things. Really got my mind out of a bad place so honestly just give it a go. The worst that can happen is you feel no better

I was all set to live a nice life overseas but all went down hill in a matter on months. Since then, I've been feeling as if I'm empty inside and lost all hope. At them time, it seemed that life wasn't worth living as everything I had worked hard for, went in vain. Since childhood I made sure to make my body my number one priority so I never drank alcohol or did drugs. But as things went bad, I started taking percs and lean to ease the pain. Some time ago, I took one too many pills and was overdosing. My friends broke into my room and found me having a seizure. I was rushed to the E. R. 
I'm lucky to be here and will never touch drugs again. I went toy first therapy session last week and I have to tell you it was a great experience opening up and letting my feelings be heard.Felt really light after that. Just want to let you know that, if things are bad right now, you gotta stay and see how things turn out. They may turn out pretty good and it's crazy how the right people walk into your life at the right time.

Changing the way you speak helps to change your perspective.,"Listen to yourself and watch your language.

Instead of saying “sorry for ranting”, say “thank you for listening to me”.

Instead of saying “sorry that I am overemotional”, say “thank you for trying to understand something difficult”. 

Instead of saying “sorry if I am a burden”, say “thank you for the time and energy you invest in our friendship”. 

Good things will come when you realize you are not an apology.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bwh1oi/changing_the_way_you_speak_helps_to_change_your/,mentalhealth
Everyone cares so much about mental health until it comes to parts that aren't romanticized.,"I'm so tired of this. I'm mainly speaking from experience. I know so many people that advocate for mental health but in reality they are just doing that to make themselves look good like they don't actually care. Those same people complain about their friends that are being ""too negative"" , those same people brag about dropping certain friends because they spend too much time alone and  never want to hang out, those are the same people that are embarrassed to be seen with their friend in public because they have self harm scars and are wearing short sleeves. They literally think that depression is just being sad and anxiety is like just being nervous about an exam. They have this version in their heads of what mental illness is that's so far from what it actually is. They kind of glamorize it in a way but there is nothing glamorous about having a mental illness. 

Again I'm just speaking from experience but i know so many people like this and it really pisses me off, they advocate so much for mental health yet they know nothing about it. They don't even try to empathize or provide some support instead they actually want nothing to do with a mentally ill person, they judged you and they just try to push toxic positivity onto you. I recently got diagnosed with depression, general anxiety disorder and CPTSD. I've had friends call me gross because at one point my depression got so bad that I didn't showed in 4 days, I've had friends that called me dramatic when I almost had a panic attack in public, I've had friends that got angry at me for not wanting to watch a movie because certain scenes triggers my PTSD, I've had friends that judged for having suicidal thoughts and they told me that ""I should think happy thoughts"" or ""You shouldn't be so negative all the time"" or ""You should be grateful because your life isn't as bad as others"". 

Those are the same people that are apart of all the mental health groups/clubs at my school and they post all over their social media for mental health awareness month and suicide prevention month but in reality they don't care about any of that. This person that I know that advocates so much for mental health once gave me a whole lecture because they thought that I was self diagnosing  (this was before I was actually diagrams with anything) and all I did was tell them that my mental health has been really bad and that I've been feeling depressed and struggled with anxiety for a really long time. I had to explain to them that you can still struggle with your mental health even if you're not diagnosed with any mental illness and they told me that I can't say that I'm feeling depressed without actually being diagnosed with depression. I'm sorry for the rant, I'm just so tired of all these hypocrites that pretend to care just so that they could look good and feel better about better about themselves.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/nhijeq/everyone_cares_so_much_about_mental_health_until/,mentalhealth
"If you were abused or felt unloved, unwanted, unheard or hated yourself as a child, please read this.","This is for anyone who was abused as a child. Or anyone who as a child felt abandoned, unloved, left out, unimportant, unheard, or hated themselves. Even if you feel like your trauma wasn't ""as bad as others"". Even if just thinking about your childhood leaves a bad taste in your mouth and you don't know why. Even if I can help just one person who is struggling. Please read this.


I wrote this when I had a revelation about myself. I knew I've been depressed my whole life. I knew I had severe anxiety and I hated myself more than words can explain. But I thought it was completely my fault - that I was a broken person. I thought I would never heal. I thought nobody would ever understand me. I just recently realized that my childhood abuse has completely shaped who I am as an adult. I never before made the connection between my childhood abuse and who I am today. It wasn't simply just a ""chemical imbalance; end of story"". You may not have experienced anything even remotely similar to what I have, but I hope after reading this some of you will start thinking and start seeing connections to your inner abused child that is still suffering from what happened to you in the past.
(Please google CPTSD if you haven't already heard of it.)

I'm gonna vent about this because I know I'm not the only one. This is something that I just recently realized and it takes a lot of weight off my shoulders to finally know why I am the way I am. This was really an eye opener for me. This is my story. *TW*

The worst part about child abuse is for a lot of us, we are too young to understand that we're even being abused. Especially in terms of emotional abuse. We don't know any different. We grew up being treated like this, and we know something doesn't feel right, but we decide it must be a problem with us. ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" 
Thankfully I did know that the physical abuse I was receiving was not okay, but honestly it took me 24 years to fully realize that I was emotionally abused as a child. 24 YEARS.

I was emotionally and physically abused by my parents and other family members (mostly my mother) starting as a very very young child, possibly infant. Of course as a child you are incapable of understanding that you are not to blame. Because of this, I believed that I was broken, horrible, and stupid. I thought something was wrong with me. Why else would my parents not love me? In my own eyes I had to be at fault. Something was wrong with me. Even as a preschooler and kindergartener I have memories of thinking ""why do I have to be me?"" and ""what's wrong with me?"". My self esteem was non-existent. 

I remember going to my pediatric doctor due to a skin infection I had as a kindergartener. I had to see this doctor weekly, and because she was so kind to me (as a doctor should be, or any adult honestly) I started to see her as a parent figure. She made me feel loved and safe when my own mother did not. I remember I brought her a picture of me that we got from school picture day. She told my parents that I must have asperger's because of how socially awkward I was and how I acting around her (the doctor.) This later proved to be false, but again added to my feeling that I was broken and bad. We stopped seeing that doctor and my parents were furious at me. Why was it not clear to this doctor that I was insecurely attached?

My self esteem and hatred towards myself only got worse as time went on, and by 4th grade I was having full on almost passing out panic attacks. Started as hypochondria, but quickly became social anxiety. I could NOT function in school because I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin. Nobody wanted to be my friend. Nobody cared about me. The teachers HATED me. And then at home, nobody loved me. When people would look at me I wanted to just disappear. I made myself believe that I was incapable of making friends or being likable which in turn basically made me be unlikable. Ironic. Nobody wanted to be around me because my anxiety made me very awkward. I viewed myself as lesser than everyone else which would follow me into adulthood. Eventually I could not talk in front of the class. If I even knew I had to say a single word in front of the class or have everyone look at me I would literally run out of the room. Complete full on flight mode. Instead of being diagnosed with ANXIETY, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I couldn't focus because I was probably always disassociating. School was not the most important thing in my mind because at both at home and at school I was trying to survive. Why on earth would school be the first thing on my mind? 

Of course I fell behind in school and struggled to keep up with assignments which in turn made me feel even more stupid. When they had psychologists coming in to my classroom to study me, it only worsened my hatred towards myself. ""They're only watching me and studying me because there's something wrong with me."" I started seeing the school psychologist, therapist and social worker weekly. I was put into remedial classes and on an IEP. I was placed in some classes with children with severe behavioral and intellectual disabilities. I was forced to take IQ tests. In 6th grade I was literally forced to STACK BLOCKS while a psychologist watched. I'll never forget seeing the notes the psychologist wrote after that. ""Lots of nervous laughter."" No shit. I'm 12 and you're having me stack 5 blocks in a specific pattern. This is after they found out I had an average IQ, mind you. Everything that they did, whether they were trying to help or not, made me feel worse about myself. ""Why can't I be like the regular kids?"" is all that went through my brain. Every single thing that happened to me only solidified the belief in my head that something was wrong with me.

I was embarrassed of my own existence.

When I'd go home and try to explain that I would shake and be so scared that I couldn't even think straight in school my parents would just scream at me. I remember getting punched in the stomach and told to suck it up after just trying to explain what was going on. I had no one to turn to. 

By 7th grade I could not go to school. If I knew I'd have to work with other students or even be looked at in front of the class I would skip school. And honestly, it wasn't that school itself was a problem. I liked school itself. I couldn't function with my low self esteem and hatred towards myself. I constantly felt singled out. I felt bad that other people even had to look at me. I was too young to put this into words, and all I was able to say to anyone about what was going on was that talking in front of the class makes me scared and shakey. 

After I started getting in trouble for missing so much school (after the school social worker and principal drove to my house to talk to my parents and do a wellness check on my family), I went with extreme measures. Even running away from home and hiding which ended up with the police looking for me. All because I didn't want to have to panic. I tried to explain my anxiety in the best way a child can without even understanding what anxiety is. I was treated like a delinquent child instead.
Ended up in court after missing hundreds of days of school and had to do weeks of community service. AT 12 YEARS OLD.

I was showing so many signs of an abused child and I had definitely brought up my family physical abuse multiple times to adults at school and nobody heard me. Nobody. I was not a delinquent. I was suffering so noticeably yet somehow nobody noticed. 

By high school I refused to wear my glasses so I wouldn't have to see people looking at me in the hallway. I was still in remedial classes all those years later, which were mostly for kids with behavioral issues.  Kids that would kick, fight, scream, do drugs, you name it - this was not me at all.  I think I gave up trying to speak out because I tried so many times and I couldn't get anyone to hear me. I ended up dropping out of high school.

Fast forward to three years ago when I was going to pursue my dream of studying and then hopefully teaching abroad in Japan. Saved up for three years for my student visa and relearned everything from the ground up to get my GED. Did both things, got accepted and started my Japanese school in Tokyo. Never in my life had I been so proud of myself. I didn't even believe I was capable of accomplishing anything in my life. The moment that plane landed I cried my first ever happy tears.

Two weeks into language school, we were going around the table of probably 20 other students learning verbs at a very fast pace. I remember time slowing down while I was waiting for it to be my turn, then I blacked out. When I came to I ran out of the classroom. I left school and walked around Tokyo sobbing. I had gotten that far and somehow completely forgot how bad my self esteem and anxiety are. My dreams completely clouded out the truth. I knew I couldn't continue with school so I dropped out, then impulsively blew all of my tuition money that I saved for years on bullshit. After coming home I hit rock bottom and was hospitalized. Once again, the belief that I was broken was renewed in my mind.

At the hospital I was told ""you're not severe enough for inpatient treatment"". The doctor spent a total of maybe 4 minutes with me. Asked me a couple questions, checked me for head injuries, and left. I went to the hospital because I knew that if I went back home I was going to end my life. I was so used to stuffing my emotions down into myself at this point in my life that even if I was on the edge of ending it all - I looked calm. I even explained to them this. After waiting 6 hours after seeing the doctor, they sent me to a place thats only purpose was to keep you from harming yourself. Great, but when I went back home I learned nothing. No coping skills, didn't talk to a single mental health professional, nothing. I was back at square one. I reached out for help for the first time as an adult and was again, failed.

Inside my head was still the once tiny little girl wondering, ""what is wrong with me?""

Memories of my childhood were again, flashing back. I sat in my room for months. I couldn't leave the house. I had no desire to exist. I ripped up every baby photo I had with my mother in them. I honestly thought I wouldn't live another year. I was going to end up killing myself. I lost all of my hope.

Now, a couple years after that I'm finally now just getting the real help I need. I had to be the one to keep reaching out. It was very hard, but I am so glad I did. I had to keep picking myself back up, again and again; If I hadn't I would not be alive. I'm so glad that I chose to fight for my life. I searched for a long time for a good psychiatrist and therapist. I finally found someone who heard me. I have even been able to forgive people who abused me. Of course I still and always will have scars, but now I am able to cope with them. 
I now know I am not broken. I am a survivor and I have been and was just trying to survive. People are now shocked when I tell them I have ""social anxiety."" Eventually I will go back to Japan when I am actually ready. 

Learning about CPTSD and realizing WHY I am the way I am has been extremely important to me. Just like I'm finally connecting the dots. I'm finally starting to love myself. The little girl that once felt so unloved is finally healing. 

I encourage all of you to learn how your trauma affects you, and know that you can also heal from it. 💕 I hope someone out there will read this and feel like there is hope. I truly hope this inspired someone out there that is in an awful place like I once was. Do not give up on yourself.

Please remember: You're not broken. You're surviving.

Threw out a self harm tool.,"Today I threw out an object that I knew I could hurt myself badly with. It was extremely hard, but I did it. 

I’ve been self harming since 2014, however, i’ve gotten clean and relapsed many times since then. I recently have been self harming on and off since December, and today I took the object I had been using, that i knew i could do a lot with, and threw it away outside of my home. I did this so I can’t go back and get it. It was really hard, but I knew I could do a lot of harm with it. I hate hiding self harm, but it’s an addiction I deal with. 

Anything is possible, even when things are hard, know you can get through it. Self harm has been a major part of my mental health issues over the years. The courage and strength it takes to get rid of something you can harm yourself with is enormous, but if I could, you can too. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/j2y84i/threw_out_a_self_harm_tool/,mentalhealth
"Tell someone who is freaking out to ""take a deep breath"" instead of ""calm down""","I think telling someone to ""calm down"" does them no good. They were already freaking out and stressing out. It also doesn't do much when instead if you say ""take a deep breathe"" it's actually telling them something to do while it calms them down. I find I get more frustrated and angry even when I tell myself to ""calm down"". I do this all the time whenever I see a guy or a girl freaking out and never get any push back for telling them to ""take a deep breathe"".

My experience in a psych ward,"Last Saturday, February 27th, was the one year anniversary of my ex cheating on me, I had really bad thoughts about harming her, like if I could end her life all my problems would be fixed. See, she was abusive to me and her cheating on me broke me mentally and sent me into a downward spiral that I thought was bipolar disorder. 

I had spoken with both my family doctor and a psychiatrist, and they both agreed that it seemed to be type 2 bipolar disorder. So, I started taking medicine for it. Now, let's jump back to last Saturday.

I realized these thoughts I were having were dangerous and that I needed serious help immediately, so I told my parents to take me to the hospital, being a bit vague on the details, and they did. I got to the ER and told the nurse everything that had been happening and I was sent to a bare room with only a boxed-in tv on the wall as an SIHI, meaning I was both suicidal and homocidal. 

The doctors at my hospital evaluated me and sent a report off to a bugger hospital an hour away that had a dedicated psych ward for patients like me. After 4 hours of waiting, I got the news that this better hospital would accept me as a patient. So, within 15min, I was in an ambulance and on my way to the psych ward.

When I arrived, I was immediately taken to a room where my vitals were recorded and my possessions were taken away, and I had to sign papers agreeing to treatment and their policies. Once I had completed the paperwork, I was made to put on a pair of no-slip socks for safety and was shown to my room. 

It was a fairly bare room, with just a desk to store what few clothes I could bring and two beds. I had to share my room with a nice old man named Arthur, who was there for mild schizophrenia. We also shared a simple bathroom with a toilet, sink, and shower. 

The operation of the psych ward were fairly simple. Meals were at 7:30, 11, and 4:30, and snacks were at 9, 2, and 8:30. We had ""group,"" at 10, 3, and 8 where we learned coping mechanism, positive thinking skills, and did occupational therapy to learn healthy hobbies and habits to give us an outlet for stress and creativity.

 They didnt force you to eat or go to group, though. Some of the patients only came out for meals and slept the rest of the day. Most of us stayed in the common room which had a water fountain and tv. We ended up watching HGTV or the Food Network most of the time. We did watch some Star Wars, too,  which was nice

Each shift change, a new nurse was assigned to you, and they were all very nice in my experience. They brought me my daytime medicine right around 9am and my nighttime medicine around 8pm. Every morning and night your nurse would come to you and ask you questions like how your day was, to rate your anxiety and depression on a scale of 1-10, and so forth. 

Your doctor would come around every morning as well to discuss outpatient plans with you to get you set up for when you leave the hospital, as well as discuss or change your medications. My doctor ended up changing my Lexapro for Prozac, upping my dosage of Lamictal, and adding Remoron to the mix. 

Alongside the doctor, I also saw a psychologist who gave me a thorough evaluation. He let me sit down and talk to him about my life leading up to how I got to the psych ward, and he filled up 3 pages full of notes. Afterwards, I took a 567 true/false quiz called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the Rorschach Test. 

I was in the psych ward until today, March 3rd. Before I left, I had one last talk with my doctor, who gave me a briefing on the psychologist's report. It turns out, I have autism. Specifically, I have Asperger's, so that was a pretty big shock to me. 

I think the biggest thing I learned in my stay at the psych ward was that the other patients are just like you and me. They're completely normal people who just need some help. None of them were mean or psychopaths. They were all just average joes with bad anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I thoroughly enjoyed talking with and getting to know them. 

So, thanks for reading about my experience in a psych ward. I will be more than happy to answer any questions you have",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/lxkry4/my_experience_in_a_psych_ward/,mentalhealth
My depression is lifting. I haven't felt this happy in 3 years.,"My depression and anxiety had its up and downs ever since I first started working. It went downhill in March when despite having a great therapist and taking meds, I got very suicidal. I was on the edge of the subway platform. I felt like a failure.

&#x200B;

I've been on sick leave since then. I thought I had disappointed so many people in my life, but my therapist has helped me in forgiving myself and moving on little by little. I decided not to go back to my current teaching position for the next school year, which will cause financial instability, but I'm in such a better mentality. Being close with my mom, she has noticed that I smile and talk more, and that what she thought was ""normal stress"" was me barely managing my depression the past three years. I was desperate to ""fix myself,"" and to just ""suck it up because everyone has work stress.""

&#x200B;

I have so much respect for teachers. I am interviewing for other schools, but I will most likely do a mix of tutoring/sub work/reception. I am still sad that I couldn't push through another school year, but I am feeling happier that I don't have to go back. I have options. And maybe someday, I will go back to the classroom in the future. I'm working on hobbies I've completely abandoned when I was working. Teaching is a huge commitment. I have mixed feelings about my ideal work situation, but I'm glad I'm taking the time to reflect and slowly plan my next steps.

&#x200B;

My meds and therapy helped a little, but what I needed most was a change of circumstances. I am only human.

"I'm struggling with something and I'm not even sure what to call it, so please help","So ive struggled with mental illness my entire life since the 4th grade, now 26(M), I have anxiety, depression, ADHD, dyslexia, and probably more. Lately I've been experiencing these sudden bouts where I'll feel fine and I'll be talking to people and being social and once the social interaction is over or even during sometimes, I get hit with this inability to feel happiness, comfort, or worthwhile. I just kinda go numb, in this existential void where I feel like nothing matters even though I know thats not true. It kinda reminds me of when people run out of serotonin and/or dopamine and can't feel anything, but i didn't think it could occur so suddenly or depend upon social interaction and if that is the case how do I fix it?

I understand why so many young adult men take their own life.,"When I was a child, a friend’s dad killed himself and it baffled me as I couldn’t understand why a man who had it all would feel that low.

And the loneliness is REAL (even when you’re in a happy relationship). And being an adult in general is just difficult. Groundhog Day every day. The thrill of teenage experiences is long gone and the realisation that this is your life now and for the rest of your life you will live the same day over and over except everyday you’re a bit more aged and warn down.

Vitamin D supplements are super cheap and you can even buy them on Amazon. Consider giving it a try. I noticed the change after only 3-4 days already.

But if you take any meds, check in with your doctor or at least Google to ensure it's safe for you to add the vitamin D supplements (there's like three meds that you'd have to be careful with, as far as I know). 

Additionally, if you're vegetarian/vegan or just don't eat a lot of meat, an iron deficiency could also be a reason for your depression. Iron supplements are also on Amazon for little money.

Hope this helps someone out ❤️


Edit: 
As this is getting a lot of traction: What this post was about is that my therapist as well as I thought that I had depression. But taking vitamin D solved many problems for me. A vitamin D deficiency can cause many of the symptoms depression does, up to the point of a misdiagnosis. That's why this post exists. Some people may be misdiagnosed, some people may not even have a therapist to diagnose them so they did it themselves and rolled with it. 

This post is a suggestion to consider the possibility and try something new, to raise awareness that something that looks and feels like depression doesn't have to be exactly that. It helped me and I hope that someone out there who's in a similar situation as I am/was can benefit from the experience I had.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ry8xbu/taking_vitamin_d_pills_cured_my_depression/,mentalhealth

My parents had sex in the same room as me for 2.5 years.,"It’s more asking if it counts as sexual trauma? 

This happened between the ages 16-18

My mom and step-dad would regularly have sex in the same room as me, the only thing stopping me from seeing it was a sheet. That my step dad got mad at me for putting up. At the time we lived in an off the grid cabin with only one room. So like, I don’t know. I just am disgusted by sex now, but have always been after borderline witnessing my mom being SA’d by my birth father multiple times growing up. I just don’t feel valid for how I feel, because I wasn’t actually touched. My family has always been open about sexual topics too. I think some people would think too open.

Was anyone else called a spoiled brat growing up (or anything close to that) but now realize it was a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues?,"TLDR at the bottom. 


Growing up, my mood was unpredictable. It was a constant state of anger, immaturity, anxiety, and fear. My parents gave me stuff I wanted but were pretty ignorant when it came to my mental health issues. They thought I would outgrow my behaviors or treat me the same way they treated my brothers. Thinking about it now, numerous reg flags were there. I was very defiant and scared of a lot of things. Many of them irrational. I remember being in like junior high and my mother telling me to get something from the car while we were at a family friends party. It was dark already and I took one look outside, saw the car parked across the street and got scared. Idk of what but my mind told me to be scared. I asked my friend to come with me but she didn’t want to and I think she was scared too because it was dark. I go back to my mom who is talking to her friends and tell her I’m scared and “(friend) doesn’t want to go with me.  I don’t want to go to the car” (friends mom was in the circle of friends like 10 of them and I was hoping she would make her go with me (I know subtle tattletale, in junior high too...currently cringing)) and my mom ended up going with me to the car. I didn’t think much of this but the next day my dad told me that one of the parents called me a spoiled brat as soon as I left with my mom to the car. Looking back I should have told my mom personally but I didn’t think it would matter since the people we were surrounded by were childhood friends who knew me at a young age. 

Growing up in my house was overall not good emotionally. Lots of instability with my father’s moods and sometimes my mother’s. I ended up being a rude child and would get angrily reprimanded by my parents (sometimes physically even if it didn’t hurt...it still did...if that makes sense). I remember saying goodbye to my parents friends (at their friends house) by just waving the off in an “eh” manner (I tried to be cute and joke with them...also I was half tired) my parents pushed me to hug them and kiss them (cultural thing) but I was just like “meh” and didn’t. I didn’t realize I was embarrassing my parents and their friends. I came off as rude. I was like 12 or 13 at the time. As soon as we got into the car my dad exploded in anger and shouted at me to never do that again. He said this while also putting his fist to my knee banging on my knee every time I didn’t give a coherent “yes” to him when he told me to never act that way again. I was in tears. I really didn’t think anything of my actions. Looking back, yeah it is rude of me but I don’t think they was the correct parental way to go about things. 

There were many instances like this. Where I would come off rude and anxious especially when I didn’t get my way with things. Forcing my friends to play with me when they didn’t want to. Telling on them to their older siblings hoping they would make their sibling play with me only to be told “she doesn’t want to play with you. That’s not my problem”, picking fights with my siblings, screaming and shouting loud enough that the neighbors can hear me... 

I was recently diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, and ADHD. In addition to my MDD, OCD, and GAD. I feel like a light just switched on this year and made me go “oh wow I really wasn’t a normal kid”.

tldr: to a lot of people growing up I came off as an annoying and rude immature brat but after analyzing a lot of my behaviors and my upbringing as an adult, I now realize it was possibly a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/gb6kuf/was_anyone_else_called_a_spoiled_brat_growing_up/,mentalhealth

Stop over-emoting at funerals and stop burdening children with adult emotions.,"As a kid, no one ever showed stronger emotion or openly cared about anyone unless they were in the hospital or at their funeral. 

I never realized how that manifested my suicidal thoughts. I’ve wanted to die for the smallest things since I was in 4th grade. After doing some personal development, I realized that my need to be cared for was always associated with hurt, sickness, and other people were responsible to make me feel cared for. 

Teach children that they’re loved & their thoughts matter. Death or sickness is not the only way to feel cared for. I now know why I always want to die. If your loved ones will only care once you’re dead, what’s the point of living? 

Lets teach our kids better. Love, belonging , and happiness is not achieved through hurt.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jtg92z/stop_overemoting_at_funerals_and_stop_burdening/,mentalhealth
Why does my (20m) mind immediately default to suicide when something bad happens to me?,"(I meant 20F and now I can't change the title)

I am very prone to spiralling, or snowballing, when something bad happens to me. 

Recently, I've been getting into arguments with my mum and it's been making me feel like shit. She tells me I'm brainwashed, makes me feel stupid, and a lot more. When I brought it up to her she denied the lot and the only apology I got was a 'sorry you feel that way' 

This isn't something small, I don't think, but i also feel as though I'm overreacting, but that just makes me feel worse, and so the spiral begins.

And it always ends with a 'you should just kill yourself'. Almost always followed with a 'no you retard thats a bad idea' 

Because other than little things like that, my life is fine. I have friends, a loving partner (long distance atm), a roof over my head and hot meals. I'm fine. Yet I'm not. And, again, it makes me feel worse that there are people who have it so, so badly, and yet I have the audacity to feel the way I do?

I do not want to bring any of this up to my mother. She would just gaslight me again. My partner knows, though, and is as supportive as he can be in the current situation. That's all I can ask for, right?

Animals know,"I had a suicidal breakdown last night. I texted my therapist and she urged me to go to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. After coming clean to my parents about my intense suicidal idealization, the crisis calmed down a bit and I decided that I wanted to sleep in my own bed (I was tired and didn’t want to spend 5 hours in the ER waiting) and to go in the morning. I woke up this morning to my cat curled up next to me. He rarely sleeps with me. I think he knows that I wasn’t okay. He’s like my guardian cat, watching guard over me to make sure I’m okay and be my companion so I could look over at him, pet him, and feel a small twinge of love for something. Happiness isn’t the right word, I don’t think I’m capable of feeling happiness right now. But when I look at my cats, I feel like maybe there is something, even if it small, that’s worth living for.

I fucking hate being told how “strong” I am because of my trauma,"My therapist said it to me in my last appointment and it just reminded me how much I fucking hate hearing it. I’m not “strong” just for going through shit. If anything it’s made me pathetically weak, I have a constant sense of fear and dread in the pit of my stomach whenever I’ve gotta deal with people and it leads me to either say whatever I think they wanna hear, or just be immediately hostile with no real in between and as a result I have literally no personality of my own.

I’m also not strong for simply just not killing myself, every time I hear that shit it’s always from someone who has no idea what it’s actually like to be suicidal 100% of the time. I *want* to kill myself, there’s no part of life that I enjoy or that I feel is worth sticking around for and yet I still can’t bring myself to *actually* do it. It’s not because I’m “too strong” or whatever, it’s because I’m too weak. I know what I want but I can’t bring myself to do it outta fear that I’ll fuck it up. I’m definitely not sticking around because of my “strength”. 

I guess that to me, hearing that shit is just a reminder that no one fucking gets it, like 99% of people will just never understand and so they say stupid shit trying to be helpful and don’t realise they’re only really telling you how alone you really are. There’s nothing fucking strong about a man who’s terrified of everyone, who’s constantly suicidal but is too afraid to act on it, and who will never even get to see his own adult body not covered in deep self-harm scars.

People in their 20s: Ever feel like running out of time?,"I always try to stay positive in front of everyone I know and most people around me thinks that I have my life all figured out. But what they don’t know is that once I’m alone, I get sucked into this deep hole of anxiousness and overthinking that keeps me up all night. I tried seeking professional help but none of it helped me. 

I kind of had my 2020 planned out but the virus ruined everything for me. I wanted a career change because I no longer want to work for a job that was way too far my major (plus it’s draining and it’s not really my passion) and I’ve always wanted to leave since the last quarter of 2019. I had no other choice but to stay within my present company cause I can’t afford to lose a job during a crisis. 

But I made a promise to myself to really stick to my decision and find a job that I’m really passionate about once this year starts...

However, job hunting isn’t really going well for me and to top that, I’m doing awful at my current job (maybe because I just don’t find the joy in working anymore + i just can’t seem to focus). Also, I started a small business just last year and it’s also not doing well as of the moment.

Everything’s all piled up, I don’t what to do, I can’t seem to find something I’m good at, I want to leave but I don’t have the courage to do so. I want to do a lot of things, but I feel like I’m just so lost. I don’t know where to start, how to start.

I can't get over the mistakes of my past, where I did or said mean things in the heat of the moment, or when I did or said things that were cringy or stupid.

Sometimes I feel like I might have been toxic because I sometimes default to sadness when I wanted attention from others. I put myself down a lot, now I realize I do that so people would lift me up and I would feel good (sometimes people would agree with me tho lmao).

I finally shaved!!!,"Before anyone asks: I am a girl.

I haven't shaved in months and if you're grossed out by that, stop reading now. 

I haven't shaved anywhere. Legs, armpits, pubic area. It just seemed too overwhelming. My boyfriend doesn't mind, so my sex life didn't really get worse because of that and I live in a colder climate, so wearing long pants during the summer was completely normal.

To be honest, I kinda liked how things were. Less waste, more time, less skin irritation and stuff. But I knew it didn't come from my worldview, but from my depression. Shaving is the least important, as I could go days without eating, without brushing my teeth and showering. 

So before I go on: shaving isn't necessary, showering is. So if you're a male, female, whatever, just don't shave if you don't want to. It's not a part of hygiene. You won't ""sweat more"" because of some hair. But take a shower from time to time. Not a full-on spa singing one hour shower, but get in there for a few minutes. Even if it'll be just standing under pouring water. 

But if you want to - just like I did - go for it. I shaved my whole body today, I used some coconut oil on my legs and scented oil under my armpits (zero-waste deodorant!). Apart from that, I also did a full on skin care routine and brushed my teeth AND flossed. Wow.
I'm sure most people do it regularly and it grosses them out when they have a single piece of salad between their teeth after a meal. But for me, it was a huge milestone. I hope to do it again tomorrow, without forcing myself. I haven't felt this fresh and sexey in quite some time.

"Mental illnesses do not affect us in equal ways, but they all suck.","My sentiments are based on being subscribed to the sub and seeing a pattern in which posts make it into my feed. This is not an attack on the sub, it's a suggestion to represent all the colors of the rainbow here.

This sub seems to mostly pay attention and support people whose mental illness makes it difficult for them to perform basic functions, like getting out of bed. I understand that life with mental illness is like a 10k race. For those struggling with the basics, every day moving a yard feels like a war against yourself, but what about those of us who are sprinting? 

I leave my house daily for work, social gatherings etc but I face many difficulties each day stemming from mental illness. I come here and I make posts about it. Hoping to find someone who feels the same. Who lives that struggle. Just one person who relates and reaches out and says yeah I'm drowning in my own thoughts too. Or hey I used to struggle with that here's what helped me. 

But I get nothing. And I see no posts on my feed from others who live a similar struggle. I'm sure they're out there, but their posts get buried or if they're anything like me, they delete them later because if no one feels the same, what's the point. All the support goes to the ones who seem to be struggling the most outwardly.

It reminds me of when I was a kid, and I had a troubled sister. I went to school, had poems put in the newspaper, great grades and had a few short stories published in books, but no one in my home paid any mind. When I left for college I asked my mother why she left me to my own devices so often. Why she didn't put so much effort into me like with my sister. She replied; ""because you've always done so well on your own, I didn't think you need me."" That has stuck with me even to this day,and that's how I feel about this sub. 

The support isn't shared and I think we all could do more to make sure there's a variety of lifestyles affected by mental illness getting the attention they deserve.

"You’re not a fucking manic pixie dream girl, and mania is not cute","Just needed to vent this out: REALLY sick of the trivialization of mental illnesses, but lately especially the notion that mania is *cute* or that being a manic girl is somehow attractive. I currently intern in inpatient psych, and the bipolar patients I work with often cause major destruction to their lives during manic periods. It’s just gross. The memefication of mental illness is disturbing.

Edit: in case I was unclear—I’m referring to people who are NOT bipolar, who romanticize mania when they do not have to deal with the things people who have the disorder do have to deal with.

Edit 2: I realize the “manic pixie dream girl” trope was not an appropriate reference. Learned my lesson y’all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/c3ssui/youre_not_a_fucking_manic_pixie_dream_girl_and/,mentalhealth

Does anyone else feel guilty for their struggles with mental health?,"Ok, I understand that guilt is a huge factor when it comes to people who struggle with mental health. I have been diagnosed with DID and Severe Generalized Anxiety. It has taken me years of medications, various therapists and learned coping mechanisms to be the overall functioning human I am today.  Everyday is still a struggle but, I’m at peace with that and just take things as they come. 

The problem I have is that I sometimes feel like I don’t deserve to have a mental illness. If that makes sense. I had a rough childhood, but when I start to have a break down or anxiety attack, I always think something along the lines of 

“There are definitely people that have had it worse than I have and they are just fine.” 
Or
“Whatever is happening isn’t as bad as what other people go through and I should just suck it up” 

My rational healthy brain tells me everything is relative blah, blah, blah. All the logical things a normal brain would think. Then my unhealthy brain just yells over the logic with intrusive thoughts that I don’t deserve to have these mental issues because my life “isn’t that bad”

I feel like I may not be doing the best job of describing what I’m feeling lol but can anyone relate?

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the comments and support. It always makes things a little easier to know Im not alone in this way of thinking.

"I know it's weird to celebrate but yesterday was the most ""normal"" day I've had in 3 years","It was fucking amazing. I watched some football. Had a nap on the couch with my dog. Watched more football. Won some money off a bet I had made with LSU. My mom came over and she and my fiance wrapped gifts while I was watching the LSU game. Afterwards I was still riding high so we went out to eat to celebrate. Even invited my girls best friend to join us as it would be my treat. I didn't feel any anxiety or paranoia while we were eating. Came home and hung out, minus my mom, for another three hours. It felt amazing to have a day where there was no episodes. No panic. No anxiety. No paranoia. No depression. No hallucinating.

To the teenagers behind me at the store,"I'm sure you thought the comments you made about me were clever, that must be why you said them loudly enough for everyone within 20 feet to hear. I assume it was super amusing making fun of me based on the giggles and laughs from your group behind me as I used the self check out for the few things I was buying. Since you lot are obviously comedic geniuses I thought I'd share your wittisms.

""Omg why would she ever leave her house in shorts?!"" Said by the pretty blonde girl whose shirt I internally admired earlier. 

You were pretty spot on since I'd hadn't worn shorts outside my home in almost 2 years. I had finally found a pair that fit well and were long enough so I thought they looked ok. Thank you for disabusing me of that notion.

""She probably doesn't leave the house often anyway. Maybe she's afraid she won't fit through the door one of these days."" Said from who I assume was blondie's boyfriend. 

Well, you were wrong about the door thing, that's a full on exaggeration because even I know I'm not that big. However you were right about me not leaving the house often but it has nothing to do with weight. It's because I'm still severely depressed over the unexpected passing of my fiancé less than 2 years ago.

""Look she's buying spinach! I guarantee it's not for her!"" This was from the brunette with blue highlights. 

Sorry to disappoint but it's totally for me.

""Why doesn't she just get that weight loss surgery? She would obviously qualify."" From a different brunette. 

Well actually honey, I already had it when I was 17 and barely qualified. This was in the very early days of bariatric surgery and I obviously didn't have ideal results. What's even worse though is it's left me with multiple, life long health issues and chronic pain. I've had to have several additional surgeries to try and correct things, with little success. A lot of those health issues mean medication and many of those medications have weight gain as a side effect. I also have Hypothyroidism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome which both can cause weight gain. As can depression, which I mentioned earlier.

""I'd kill myself if I ever got that big."" Said by blondie. 

I guess it's A: good you're not because no matter how horrible your comments I would never wish for you to feel like you needed to die and B: I guess I'm mentally stronger than you. That's probably because of all the shit I've been through but believe me there are often days when I think I'd be better off dead. And I'd be lying if I didn't say how hard it was after hearing your comments to just make it to my car before I broke down crying. 

I don't know why you all felt the need to be so cruel but I hope eventually you learn to have a little more empathy. You don't know me or my story, but you judged me based solely on my weight and found me lacking. Therefore I was worthy of your scorn. 

Your comments hurt, and I imagine they will stick with me for awhile, but they won't break me. However, someday, if you continue this act you might end up being the last straw that does break someone. I hope you never have to realize that your comments pushed a person to end their life and I also hope you never have to feel the way you made me feel today. 

Everyone, please just keep in mind that you don't know what people are going through.

It's been a month since I decided not to kill myself.,"A month ago I jokingly told my online friend that nobody would care if I died (not directly but it was obvious I was talking about that) and she said that she would cry if I died. That's what broke me. I never cry but that was the first time in months where I cried for real. It was like something hit me. We aren't extremely close but she unknowingly got me through the hardest time in my life. I owe her everything. 
That was when I decided I will not die. Ever. No matter how unappealing the concept of living became.

It's been a month. 

A teacher at my high school helped me realize what I achieved and that I should be proud of myself. I'm not a native English speaker but I taught myself English in 3 years and by the time I was 15 I was at level C1. She showed me that it's OK to be proud of the things I did. And for the first time, I believed her.
After starting my antidepressants everything slowly got clearer and brighter. 
I even got a friend at school! An actual friend that wants to talk to me! She sometimes laughs at the fact that I say ""thank you"" every time she agrees to go somewhere with me but I'm just so happy and surprised that I'm talking to people.
I never thought I could be this happy. I feel like I'm 12 again, happy with friends, going out. I never thought it was possible to get out of the lowest of the lows.

It's still not perfect but it's definitely enough for now. I'm still not in a safe situation when it comes to my sexuality, but I have support from my roommate, who likes to give me tough love from time to time, from my English teacher who's an absolute sweetheart, my friend from school who likes me for who I am, my online friend who's probably reading this right now (love you bitch) and my cats who are the sweetest and most annoying creatures ever.

Why do older generation people think depression is something we make up and it's just a western concept?,"Yesterday my mom was nagging me to tell her why I have been behaving weirdly. I got fed up and told her I have been in depression for years and she called my dad.

Well for starters they don't believe I'm in depression because ""my face doesn't seem sad"". Secondly I'm not a doctor so I can't diagnose myself with depression and since I learned about depression from google, apparently by reading too much about it my brain made me think I'm in depression. And that it didn't exist years back, and it's just western culture and not exactly real.

When I told them a few reasons that included them, they are saying this is what happens everywhere meaning this happens in every household and they don't see them depressed.

"How do I explain my burnout to ""youre just lazy"" people?","Not only burnout, I also have depression. I'm 23.

I don't have a job. I could theoretically work a job, but I would not perform well at the job at all and possibly get fired for being unproductive, it would also do more harm than good to me. But the main reason I don't have a job is because a job would drain my time and energy, which I desperately need to work on my physical and mental health and also my to-do list at home, I just cannot handle any more responsibilities currently. Its too much, im already fighting a battle 24/7 and I do not wanna attempt to work even harder than what is physically possible.

So now I often get judged ""you are 23 why dont you have a job??"" or ""you should be studying""

""you should"" ""why dont you"" but when I reply that I don't have time and energy for a job or whatever they want me to do, they reply that I'm just lazzy and privileged.

I guess that someone who has always been mentally healthy cannot understand what it feels like to be unmotivated, to be physically tired or mentally, to have a brain that does not function well, to wake up tired even after 9 hours of sleep.

Self-care is not participating when you don’t want to.," There  is power in standing up for yourself and sticking to your personal  boundaries regarding how you participate in life as a trauma survivor. I  hate the constant barrage of showing up because of obligation. Fuck  that. I mean, when I think about the fact that people will shame you  over not doing something that you don’t want to do, I get irate. I think  about how many times in our lives that we are put in the position of  showing up due to social constructs, and I want to smash my face into  the wall. **You don’t owe anyone your time or sanity.**

I  implore you to please take care of yourself over the next few weeks  starting today. The number one thing that people healing trauma can do  is to say no or to say nothing at all. You don’t have to go to family  gatherings and events where past abusers are present. You don’t have to  go to work get-togethers because you are in recovery, and Tom can’t have  just one drink. You don’t have to go to the hundreds of things you are  invited to. Why? Because you are a goddamn adult, and you have the  choice here. No one is going to force you into a car, to put the key in  the ignition, drop the gear to D, and hit the road. If I’m wrong about  that, we have much more severe problems on our hands.

Creating agency as a trauma survivor

Look,  here is the deal. We are used to putting our needs secondary as CPTSD  survivors. At some point, our needs got put on the back burner as a  survival mechanism. That is OK. We can acknowledge that. However, as we  move forward, we must follow our gut instinct and listen to what our  soul tells us. If everything in you is screaming, **don’t go,** then don’t go. And don’t tell me that it’s easy said than done because you are in control. Y-O-U.

You  have the power here, and look, I know that is scary, but it’s true. You  can step into your personal boundaries, and your right as a human being  is that you only have to do what you want to do. I trust that the truth  of our healing journey recognizes that we are allowed to have agency in  our lives.

I challenge you to  continue to double-down on your personal boundaries and your right to  say no. Hell, start today. No law states you must suffer through another  family thanksgiving with your narcissistic mother, verbally abusive  step-father, racist grandmother, or anyone in between. Today, if you  need to say no, please say no. Order Pad Thai; it’s better than turkey  anyway.

Until next time my friend…

Talking about my SH is still strange for me since I didn’t even know that what I do is SH until a few months ago. So it’s been a harder habit to break since I didn’t know that I was doing it.

How do I(22F) get over the trauma that a kid(9F) put me through?,"I know I sound like a wimp, but keep reading.

I am an mental health tech, and my job is to basically be a glorified babysitter for special needs kids. I'm good at my job, but something last night makes me start shaking when I think about it. 

One of my clients scares me. I don't know her exact problem, but her father told me that her mother had done dope and drank alcohol when she was pregnant with her. 

This girl was throwing a tantrum after we left a pet store. She insisted that she held cats (which we couldn't because covid.) First she whined, then she cried, then she snapped. I had to call her mother, and we stayed on the phone with her to get her to leave the pet store, literally one step at a time. 

When we got to the car, she began *screaming* at the top of her lungs that she wanted my tablet to play games on. I wouldn't let her, because she already threatened to break it. This lasted for twenty minutes. I drove with her, another client, and my shadower(new hire in training), to the highway. The girl suddenly stopped screaming, unbuckled herself, and got up next to me while I was driving 70mph. She leaned against me, and told me that I was ugly, had no friends, deserved to die, and would kill me if I let her. She began reaching for the wheel all slowly and dramatically like she was going to yank it into the oncoming traffic from my left side. The shadower yanked her back, but she kept lunging for the wheel, trying to make us crash into the other cars. I eventually pulled over on the side of the highway and called her mom. The girl then opened the car door and tried to run out into the field, saying that she was going to get us in trouble for losing her. We dragged her back into the car, and put on the child lock. She didn't like that, and tried to fight us once we got settled again. When her mom finally came, she started acting all nice, denying everything that happened. She took the child home, and we took the other client home.

I forgive this girl, because she has a mental illness and couldn't control herself. Yet, I can't stop shaking, and I couldn't sleep that night because I kept dreaming about deadly car crashes. Car crashes are one of my biggest fears, I cant help but feel terrified when I even think about getting in one. I get genuinely scared when I picture her in my mind, and deep down I want her dead. 

I will have to see her again, only time I will be prepared. How do I get over this fear that causes me to black out, start trembling, and cant form words correctly? 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Client almost got me and a car full of people killed, and I can't get over the fear of being around her now. How do I get over this fear and continue my job as a mental health tech?",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/lpayuh/how_do_i22f_get_over_the_trauma_that_a_kid9f_put/,mentalhealth
My son had a panic attack on Friday. We talked about it,"My son and I do a little podcast every week to help parents build a better relationship with their children. On Friday his genetics, mixed with his stress levels as a teenager and a member of the divorced parents club kicked in, and he had a panic attack. He asked me if we could discuss it on the podcast, for him to let it out and also to help others out whose kids may be going through the same. I thought it may be helpful to post it here.

"If your compassion doesn't include yourself, it's incomplete - be as kind and understanding to yourself as you would be to a friend who is suffering","Compassion is something we find easy when we think of someone we love. But what about someone you find annoying or don’t like? If you think about someone you’ve met who wasn’t very nice to you, or someone that was rude or did something you didn’t agree with, you might ask the question why would you feel compassion for someone who behaves this way. 

The importance of compassion isn’t only to relieve suffering and make the world a better place, it’s to free yourself from your own suffering - your sadness, your anxiety and particularly your anger. When you see the suffering of others in their behaviour it helps to reduce your own resentments.

But where we can really struggle is feeling compassion towards ourselves; when we’re suffering we sometimes punish ourselves more for not being good enough. Compassion begins with yourself - when you let go of the idea of who you think you need to be and accept yourself as you are it’s an act of kindness that allows you to start to let go of suffering.

Has anyone else had depression and other mental illnesses for so much of your life that you feel like it's part of your identity and as much as you hate it you can't imagine yourself without it?,"I'm 29. At age 13 I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and about six months ago I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I also get anxiety attacks sporadically but never been diagnosed with anxiety to my knowledge. The first time I had mental health problems I was four or five years old. I got put into a psychiatric hospital for a week when I was five (don't want to get too much into why I was put in but basically I had extreme trouble regulating my emotions), and it was at that point that I internalized the thought (or message I thought I was getting) that I was bad and wrong and messed up. A year later my mom died from cancer and I thought I had made her sick because I stressed her out too much from being ""bad"". So again my vision of myself as a bad person was heavily internalized and confirmed. Then I went through bullying and teasing at school from age 8 to 12 because I was fat (from comfort eating because of losing my mom) and awkward and every demeaning thing the bullies said just confirmed my belief in myself being a disgusting ugly embarrassing pathetic piece of trash. Around age 10 was the first time I wanted to die. Age 13 I was hospitalized again for being suicidal. I've been on about 10-12 various medications (at different times) since I was 13 trying to treat my mental health. I have done probably 10 years of weekly therapy appointments. And despite all that nothing helped me 100% or even 50%. I still was depressed and anxious, I developed an eating disorder that went in and out of my life for 10 years, I still hated myself and had very low self-esteem and self-injured and felt suicidal and just...dark.

At 29 I still feel like I'm just destined to be this way. My biological father died from alcoholism after having it for about 35 years and he also had been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder recently before he died. My mother's side of the family had depression and anxiety and food addiction. I just feel like I'm destined to be and stay mentally ill. And I feel like it's part of my identity. Ever since my mom died I've gone through life feeling isolated and different from everyone else around me. I feel I'm just a broken person and I've felt it so long I really internalized it at a very early age. I know it sounds ridiculous but since the dark, self-hating, self-sabotaging thoughts are all I have known for practically all my life, they are.... comforting to me in a strange way. It feels.... right? to just wrap myself up in a blanket of sadness and turn my back on the world. I can't see myself being any other way. I feel like it's formed my personality? I'm not really sure. I just... at this point in my life I can see how not fixing my depression and other issues will leave my life in ruins and possibly end with me dead by suicide or reckless behavior, or long-term hospitalized. Obviously neither of those I would like, but another part of me feels indifferent to that happening. Like, ""...meh, you're a piece of shit and so messed up anyways, you're just another human out of the billions of others contributing to the demise of this planet so it really wouldn't be a big deal and would be better in the long run.""

I'll end here before I continue rambling on. Basically, I feel like being mentally ill is embedded into my DNA and is in every part of me and I can't find the motivation to try to change it or even the belief that I deserve that change or that it will even ever happen. Additionally I feel like I have no idea who I would be without it. Has anyone felt this? Can anyone relate?",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/e44yen/has_anyone_else_had_depression_and_other_mental/,mentalhealth
"Six months after my suicide attempt, I’m traveling alone and loving life.","Almost exactly six months ago, I tried to take my life. I was misdiagnosed with MDD but after my attempt and hospitalization was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I was put on new medication, started therapy, moved to a new apartment and generally hit the reset button on my life.

Now, I’m traveling Europe alone for the first time. I’m doing what I want when I want, meeting new people, seeing things I never thought I’d see, and loving every minute of it. Every second I think about the fact that I could have not had this opportunity. I could have cut my life short and never been to Europe, never felt the freedom of standing at the top of a waterfall in Iceland or on the River Thames in London. 

I’m so thankful that I made the call before it was too late, and that I had people in my corner when I woke up in the emergency room that cold March morning. I’m glad that I chose life, despite how hard it can be, how cloudy and dark and hopeless it is at times. I’m glad that I sought help and got the help that I needed.

I still feel hopeless and lost and miserable sometimes. We all do. But I want every person here to take a deep breath before they consider ending their short, beautiful life too soon. You never know what more there is to see and feel and experience. I love myself now, and I love you all.

Cheers xx

Edit: Thank you all for your support! I wanted to clarify that I wasn’t meaning to brag or seem like I just dropped everything and hopped on a plane. I actually planned this trip back in January, before my attempt, which perhaps makes it even more profound. I was tempted to cancel the trip during my treatment and recovery, but after six months I’m finally trusting myself again and feeling connected to myself and the world around me. Getting on the plane felt terrifying, but I’m so glad I went through with something that is good for me mentally, emotionally and spiritually. It’s a chance to sit with my thoughts and take in the world around me. My Eurotrip can be your anything—going somewhere new or sitting in a park you pass everyday. I just want you to feel as alive as I do!

We need to change the way we talk about anxiety and depression.,"
I think we need to change the name of anxiety and also depression so that they sound as serious as they are. So many people just completely brush off these serious mental health issues because they are so common. Thinking that ‘feeling depressed’ or a bit ‘anxious’ is the same as a full blown mental illness. Telling someone you have depression or anxiety feels like it has the same impact, as telling someone you have a cold. 
It needs to be talked about in a more serious manner so that people suffering from these sometimes life ruining mental illnesses don’t have to be ashamed. 
Pretty much every person i have spoke to who has or did have clinal depression (including myself) say that they often feel guilty, they have thoughts similar too “other people have it so much worse than me” or “im just over exaggerating.” This is not how things should be. People shouldn’t have to feel bad for being in pain. Think about it this way, you dont see a guy with a broken leg feeling guilty about having broke his leg. No, he goes to the doctors, gets help, lets it heal and will likely receive get well soon letters from family or friends. Why does the same not happen with a broken mind?
If everyone in a community can realise how serious anxiety and depression actually is, then they can empathise with those who suffer, helping MILLIONS of people who’s lives are a constant struggle, to at least feel a little bit more understood, accepted by their peers and less guilty. That to me, would be a massive step in the right direction ❤️


PS. Mental health in general needs to be spoken about a lot more. I just talked about anxiety and depression in this because i feel they are considered less serious than other mental illnesses by many.

"Being lonely in the 21st Century where we are living in a super-connected world is fricking hard, mentally taxing and it burns me out","To avoid getting into the details, I have to build a thick wall around myself because I have been struggling with multiple mental health issues for pretty much all my life.

But slowly and surely, I have been gathering strategies, techniques and other methods on how to deal with them, even though the amount of effort and time that it took me was way longer than I waited for them to be and I still have a lot stuff to delve into in order to master these strategies.

Over the years, I have been learning how to break that thick wall that I built over the years and slowly creep into the dark unknown and face these demons and even face the real world due to that my experiences has left me with a scared and scarred image of the world.

But for some reason, dealing with loneliness is perhaps one of the most exhausting, nerve-wrecking and humiliating war that I had to fight through.

I am well aware that loneliness is not easy to deal with - it is a mentally tricky thing to face and counter and can lead to so many other traps and other complications and difficulties that you sometimes become stuck in a maze or a in a super-thick and sticky web of different threads with different poisons slowly sucking away what is left of your blood, soul and health.

It is a double-edged sword that you want to get out of this invisible prison but at the same time, the prison is also your only ""home"" and walking out of it is very scary and the fear of being rejected, even if you try to be as friendly as possible, is very tough to overcome.

&#x200B;

The person few years, I had to really pull myself from my bootstraps to overcome the traps of loneliness - the fear of being rejected, the neediness of attention and the appropriate social skills for different situations.

Yet for some reason, as much as the world of today *should* be able to allow me to use the resources that we use today like social media to my advantage to reach out but in reality, it is often the opposite!!

&#x200B;

I know that social media is a big joke and a trap of itself where behind every smile and photo of the last party, dinner or get away that you want to hides a dark thing that you do not want to share to the rest of the world.

Yet at the same time, seeing the sheer amount of photos and posts where I see smiles and even laughs with other people, friends or even random strangers, it makes me feel angry and pathetic with myself, desperate to do something about it.

I reached out plenty of times with other people but more often than not, communication in the 21st Century makes us more alien than connecting to one another.

It is super easy to ghost someone nowadays or leave a seen without even giving a clear reason why or giving the cold shoulder because the person you are talking to is simply a stranger or you do not like for no reason whatsoever. I constantly feel that I do not know where I am with another person. It is humiliating and nerve-wracking and it burns me out. It makes me feel pitiful, petty, little. It makes me feel less of a human being and like I am being passively-aggressively bullied.

&#x200B;

Yet it is also pretty hilarious that the technology of today is supposed to make us more connected yet it makes it too easy to push people away. 

Why is it common to leave only seen almost after every message? Why not just speak from the heart? Or just say a word? Anything

I feel humiliated and angry and constantly going through a thick and mighty storm every day to keep myself sane throughout this process and it feels like I am going around in circles or walking inside a maze where I have no idea where I am going.

I know that loneliness is also in my head (even though my mind and body have real reactions to the feeling) but this feeling is incredibly overwhelming and when I try to reach out, nobody is available or I have to be very careful of what to say to others as though I am walking on eggshells because of random excuses like being busy or unavailable and/or whatever excuse they can think of to avoid contact",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hrmfqc/being_lonely_in_the_21st_century_where_we_are/,mentalhealth

I don’t give a shit if someone is “faking” anxiety/depression.,"Disclaimer: this isn’t targeted at any one individual or group, but rather a school of thought that seems to have penetrated everyday discourse surrounding mental health. If I say “you” or “you people”, I’m referring to people who subscribe to the bullshit thinking I’m about to outline. This was meant to be posted to r/unpopularopinion but got deleted, so I figured y’all could appreciate my sentiment instead.

It seems like whenever I see a post about mental health (outside of subs that are directly related to the concept), the same point comes up.

*”DuH… like 90% of people who say they have depression are just faking it for attention! All those kids on TikTok just want to LARP as Billie Eilish and pretend they have a mental illness so they can be trendy!!”*

Just, stop. And I say this as someone with *diagnosed* depression, anxiety and ADHD. Here’s why this way of thinking is complete and utter **horse shit**.

First off, depression/anxiety are *incredibly* common, and exist on a wide spectrum of severity. When people see someone who claims they’re depressed, but still manages to go to work/school without many problems, they automatically jump to the thought of “oh well they seem to be doing pretty well. they’re not *really* depressed.”

This is such bullshit because unless you’ve advanced science by 5 decades and figured out how to read someone else’s thoughts, you don’t know what the fuck they’re going through. Even if that “normal” person seems functional, there’s no telling what’s going on in their head. 

You think everyone who has “real” depression is a lifeless sack of garbage who sits in bed crying all day? Guess what, there’s probably a handful of people at your job/in your class that have “real” depression. They just hide it well because that’s what people with mental health issues *have to do* in order to succeed.

Second, on the flip side of the coin, *so many* people assume the complete opposite. “This person has depression and ADHD, but doesn’t take care of themselves and can’t hold down a job without breaking down? God, another faker, huh? That’s not mental illness, that’s *laziness*”.

Like, *what the fuck is wrong with you???* That’s literally what severe mental illness does to you? If “depression” can’t exist if you’re doing well on the surface, and it *also* can’t exist if you’re doing terribly on the surface, then what the hell do you think depression is!?

But even putting aside the obvious lack of understanding regarding mental health, it’s *still* fucked up to call someone out as a “faker”.

Look at it this way, let’s say someone actually *is* faking it. They post on social media claiming they have depression, but they actually don’t.

*WHO FUCKING CARES?*

Even if they don’t have a diagnosed mental illness, they clearly aren’t getting the attention they need outside of social media. And since when is asking for attention a bad thing? Most of the people who receive these complaints are *literally children.* You think that if a fucking *child* is resorting to random strangers online for support, there’s absolutely *nothing* wrong with them? And they *don’t* need people to hear them out? Of fucking course not!!

And here’s the biggest problem. WHO ARE WE TO DECIDE WHETHER SOMEONE IS FAKING OR NOT?

Mental illness transcends class, race and gender. Nobody is immune from chronic depression/anxiety. 99% of the time you *cannot fucking tell* if someone has a mental illness or not. Because it’s a **M E N T A L** illness. 

So why take the chance on saying “oh they’re just lying for attention”, when there’s a strong possibility that they’re serious and you’re just making it worse by making them feel like an impostor?

Seriously, what does anyone stand to gain from calling someone out for “faking it”? 

“Oh, but the more people who fake it, the more stigma there will be against people who have *actual* mental illness.”

Bull. Shit. Where do you think that stigma is coming from? Because it sure as fuck isn’t coming from people who actually care about mental health.

It’s coming from people like you, who refuse to believe that mental illness can affect *everyone*. No mental health professional, or doctor, or caring person is shutting these people down. It’s just people like you. The resources to treat mental health are always available, but people who need them aren’t getting them because they’re constantly told that they’re making it worse for people who have “real” mental illness.

And one more thing.

“Oh you probably self-diagnosed, didn’t you? That means your mental illness isn’t real.”

Oh, fuuuuuuck off.

First of all, how do you think you get a diagnosis in the first place? You think a doctor is gonna come to your house, take one look at you and say “yep, you’ve got depression”. That’s not how it works! You get a diagnosis by recognizing symptoms within yourself, condensing them and narrowing it down to a few possibilities, then bringing that info to a professional when/if you can. This process is known as, you guessed it, **self-diagnosis**.

And what about people who *can’t* get diagnosed? I’m lucky enough to live in a place where mental health is taken seriously and covered by insurance. So, I was able to be diagnosed and treated from a young age.

What about people who aren’t so lucky? In the US, you can pay up to $500 for an initial consultation. Not everyone can afford that. And in some countries, mental health treatment is a fucking joke.  It’s chocked up to weakness or insanity sometimes, so good luck getting a diagnosis in one of those places. And actually getting a prescription for meds? That’s a whole other mountain to climb, even in more progressive countries.

So if you’re in an area where getting a diagnosis is next to impossible, what are you supposed to do? Just sit there feeling miserable and telling no one because you “might be faking it”? Fuck no, you get online and do what you can to find support and raise awareness for others in your situation.

Bottom line, nobody knows what mental illnesses someone else is or isn’t dealing with. And even if you do, why the hell do you care?

You’re not helping anyone. You’re not saving resources for people who “actually” need them. All you’re doing is making everybody feel worse.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/pfa5s6/i_dont_give_a_shit_if_someone_is_faking/,mentalhealth

"Does anyone else hate how people throw around the terms ""narcissist"" and ""sociopath"" on Reddit?","Narcissistic personality disorder is a horrible, painful condition. It's a mental disorder that, just like any, ruins the lives of people who never wanted to be this way. Like other personality disorders it takes away someone's control over their own thoughts and behaviours and twists their perceptions of the world around them. They've quite often been through abuse which has led them to develop their condition, and often they aren't even able to see that there's anything wrong - just like in other psych conditions.

Sociopathy hasn't even been considered a real diagnosis for decades. The closest thing is antisocial personality disorder, which is another horrible condition that people are forced to live with. It damages someone's ability to empathise and feel positive emotions, their ability to control strong bursts of anger or sadness and to properly deal with their emotions, and it makes people struggle to control impulsive behaviour and fit in with society. Someone with ASPD isn't the stoic, emotionless killer from a horror film or the cool, charismatic, cunning CEO. In fact they're very often poor and not too clever, having grown up in toxic environments and never getting the support they need to develop properly.

Both of these conditions are extremely complex and very, very hard to identify and diagnose, even for an experienced psychiatrist sitting across from their patient.

Reddit uses these terms the way people used ""retarded"" a decade ago. People have taken crippling conditions that they know fuck all about beyond watching slasher films and Dr Phil, and turned them into slurs.

It's even worse just how readily people make these armchair diagnoses. Whenever anyone does something bad, they must be a *sociopath!* It couldn't just be that normal people like you and me sometimes do bad things for a variety of very complex reasons - no, they must be a sociopath (and that means monster!)

Whenever a /r/relationship_advice or /r/amitheasshole post describes someone doing something that could even just be interpreted as slightly unreasonable, or a slight overreaction, they're a TOXIC NARCISSIST! No, they didn't just snap because they've been under a lot of stress like any human can, they dont just seem unreasonable because we don't know what's going on in their head and know their side of the story. No, they're a NARCISSIST! And it seems *everyone* on Reddit knows at least one narcissist, usually more.


And how do you deal with someone who has a debilitating mental health condition? You cut them out of your life completely! After all, they're toxic and they'll ruin your life if you let them!

my brain tries to convince me that everyone secretly hates me,"I was diagnosed with social anxiety 4 years ago.
Lately I've been noticing that after social interactions I can't stop thinking about the ways I ""messed up"". And even though I'm able to convince myself logically that it wasn't that bad and that people don't hate me for it, I keep thinking that they just pretend to like me and secretly think I'm a terrible person.

I can't stop beating myself up over minor mistakes and I try to distract myself from these thoughts, but they always come back and then they won't leave me alone. I've talked to others and asked for their assessment of the situation that I currently can't stop thinking about and they reassure me that it's not that bad which helps for a while but then I go back to thinking that I made a horrible mistake and people are lying to me when they say it's okay.

This happens with things that happened years ago or when I was a child, too. It's keeping me up at night, it makes me feel physically sick, it makes it hard to eat and makes me angry because I'm trying to get better, I'm trying to put myself out there and overcome my fears but as soon as I'm alone with my thoughts it backfires.

I try to fight this feeling by playing memory games, drinking a lot of coffee and reading lots of non-fiction books but nothing helps. I should also point out that I don't have any diagnosed mental or cognitive illnesses, In a recent IQ test I scored 109 (Even though the paper specified that the results might be a bit inaccurate since my scores to each section of the test were very imbalanced meaning that I could be a genius when it comes to logic but a dumbass when it comes to memory. Either way, they didn't specify nor did they tell me if the actual results are likely higher or lower)

Ignoring Instagram for the sake of your Depression,"Hey guys and girls,

in the last time I'm again at a very low point of my life and deep depression. I noticed that my feelings get worse when I'm scrolling through instagram seeing the posts and ""lives"" of other people and friends. I know it's not always the whole reality they show there, it's only the best part they post often with big theatre to have a worthy post. That's life today. Still I feel so bad seeing other people being with other people together having fun which remembers me that I should do the same but I'm not able to have much joy due to my depression and social anxiety. Then I feel guilty and worthless.

Who else here has the same experiences? Did anyone of you quit or at least ignore instagram for a time and saw definite positive improvements in their mental health? I think I won't delete Instagram as it's something a bit important like WhatsApp. Well ok it's not even near as important as WhatsApp but I don't know I probably would miss some things as I already deleted snapchat years ago and people tell me oh you missed this and that I sent you. But that's no problem for me, WhatsApp & Instagram is enough of the always online always having to present the perfect life bullshit.

I would love to read about your experiences and suggestions! Much love to everyone with depression, it's only the brain telling us false things and emotions. It's not reality.

33 m. I had sex with my therapist after two years of being treated for Borderline Personality Disorder.,"So this is a long one. Going to try and keep it short, and be available to answer questions.

Two years ago, with nearly 20 years of mood swings, sadness, anger, substance abuse, and hyper sexual behaviors behind me, I decided it was time to get help. My wife of 8 years was asking for a divorce, and my life had become unmanageable.

I started seeing a psychologist through the VA. I’m an army veteran. She turned out to be a specialist in BPD and after some time was able to diagnose me. I had always suspected either BPD or Bipolar. 

We’ve worked together for about 2 years and have made amazing progress. She leads a Dialectic Behavioral Therapy group that worked wonders for me. It was life changing. Emotional intelligence, mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance are all part of my life now. I’m not perfect, and I’m always willing to put in the work, but life is better than ever before. I truly feel like my BPD is in recession. I also recently got sober, which helps a lot.

So this last February my wife and I separated. This is primarily due to my unstable moods, anger issues, substance abuse, and hyper sexuality. I moved into my own place and it took months to stabilize and get into a healthy and productive routine.

My last appointment with my therapist, I mentioned that I understood I was in a vulnerable situation and I was taking dating very cautiously. Being roughly 70 days sober, not completely over my ex, and prone to emotional dependency, I need to really consider my actions and emotions. I’m in a vulnerable place where I could relapse in a few different ways.

Well two days after that she texts me at 11:30 pm and starts flirting with me. She’s never texted me before and acknowledged how risky it was to do so.

She even mentioned the fact that I said I was vulnerable, and stated she felt vulnerable as well.

I at first told her I wasn’t available because I had gone on a date with a new girl and wanted to give that my full attention while I figured out where it was going. Also, I’m not attracted to this woman.

Another day goes by and I can’t fight the curiosity. I started texting her and just soaked up the attention what felt sexually deviant. Asking her about why she likes me. What she’s into. What she would do to me. What she wants me to do to her.

Here’s the thing. I have a history periods of being sexually involved with people who I’m not attracted to because I like the attention, I like being used, and I like things that feel taboo. I almost always end up feeling ashamed and disgusted by my behavior when this happens. And this woman, more than anyone knows all of that about me. 

Well two nights after she texted me for the first time, I went over to her place to give her what she wanted. She didn’t pressure me to, so we were both consenting, but it doesn’t feel good now. I almost immediately realized I wasn’t into what I was doing, but I stayed and kept doing things until I got her off. Then I left.

Looking back on it, it feels a little predatory. Here’s the person I’ve been most honest with about my hyper sexual episodes and how they’ve always made me feel bad. And I end up getting baited into just that. 

I’m not going to report her. At this point I should have better control over myself. But I’m disappointed in both of us.

I’ve since asked her to refer me to a new therapist. She did so happily and respectfully, and the new one feels like a great fit. 

There ya go.

EDIT:

I want to thank everyone for the overwhelming response to this post. I have to admit, I was honestly struggling with whether or not I should feel bad about this situation. It’s pretty clear now that what she did was wrong. Had the cards not been so stacked in her favor, she’s definitely not someone I would’ve been intimate with.

So here’s the update, and I’ll say at the beginning that many people are going to be less than satisfied. I reached out to her and told her exactly how I feel about what happened, how it was manipulative and I’m left feeling used. She seemed to be apologetic and understanding as to why I felt that way. I say “seemed” because to be brutally honest I don’t know if this is a one time fuck up, or a calculated cruel person just doing her thing. Of course when you get called out on doing something wrong, you say whatever it takes to deescalate the situation. So who the fuck knows. 

I want to preface this next part with my feelings of how to support people dealing with abuse, trauma, and the like. I think it’s important to make yourself available to listen, offer support, and support them in finding closure, however they deem necessary. I’ve had friends who were assaulted and didn’t report it, and I tried to understand that it’s their closure to find, not mine.

She said I’d be well within my rights to report this, if I decided to do so. I’m not planning on reporting her. I’m not blaming myself for what happened, but again it’s not uncommon for me to get myself into situations I regret like this. I’ve expressed how I feel about it, I’m choosing to believe that she is sorry and remorseful (choosing because again, I’ll never really know) and I’m moving on. It’s not fair to be taken advantage of, but I also don’t feel like it’s fair for me to be the one who has to report this and take on that process. 

Go easy on me, but this is where I’m at with it. Who knows, I may end up feeling differently about it in the future. Hell even as I write this I’m thinking “did she ever care about my well being? She never contacting me outside of a meeting to check on me. Even after I’d cry in a meeting and tell her I don’t know what to do, and I couldn’t fix my life, I couldn’t control myself. She never texted. It was only when she wanted sex that she went there”. Yeah. Idk. That’s where I’m at. Sorry to let y’all down.

"Mental illness isn’t a choice, we don’t wake up one day and say “Hey you know what?! I want to start hearing voices in my head. That sounds like a great idea! Let’s throw in some anxiety and a dash of depression while we’re at it!”","Living with a mother who has a mental illness, caused me to have a lot of resentment and anger as a child. It has also caused me to have my own issues with anxiety and depression. 

My mom had her own business and was very successful. When I was 8 we had a flood in our house that completely destroyed her business. I didn’t know it at the time, but she started doing heavy drugs. She would constantly pass out and not eat for days. 

At 8, I was no longer a child but a parent. I remember going into our kitchen to cook food so she would eat and seeing pipes and burnt spoons on the counter. As a teenager she would trick me into thinking that we could practice driving so I could get my license. When in reality, she would be flagging people down the street asking if they had any drugs she could buy. Few years later, she was put in a psychiatric hospital. She had called the police telling them to stop following her and bugging her house. She was arrested and placed in a psychiatric facility and diagnosed with schizophrenia. She was later court ordered to stay in a half way house. After her time was up, she decided that she never needed help and was able to walk out freely without anyone stopping her. 

Anosognosia has serious consequences. I’ve watched my family members step away from her like the plague because they became so angry with her that she wouldn’t admit that she needed help or believed that she was doing it on purpose for attention. They convinced themselves that she would somehow “snap out of it.” 

Here’s my main point in all of this, if a person does not think that they need help they will NOT get treatment. In coping with my own mental issues, forcing anyone to do something they hate is far worse for our mental health. Instead of fighting it, accept it for what it is  Stop putting these expectations on us that are unrealistic. Sometimes we don’t need help in the way you think is best. We don’t need further rejection or guilt. Most times we just need support. We need love.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9zfdlo/mental_illness_isnt_a_choice_we_dont_wake_up_one/,mentalhealth

Was the way my mother touched and treated me growing up normal?,"Im 21 now. I don’t even know at this point. I’ve been thinking a lot about my childhood, and now I’m remembering lots of things. This might just be jumbled because I’m just typing as a go.

I remember since I was a child, she would touch me between the legs. A lot. She’d tickle me or pinch me there to tease me. This has probably happened hundreds of times. I don’t think it really stopped until I was 18 or 19, maybe? It wasn’t under my clothing so I don’t think it was sexual. It was just weird.

She had a weird obsession with my underwear. She would smell my used clothes in front of me a lot. Sometimes she would call me over and smell my underwear while I was wearing it. If I told her no, she would tell me that it was her job as a mother to do this and that all moms do this with their children. She said it was her favorite smell. This kept going into my teenage years.

We had this weird joke about me not wearing underwear. So sometimes she’d check. She’d touch my butt or my genital area to see if she could feel it beneath my pants. Other times she’d also just pull back my pants and just look. The last time I remember her doing this was when I was 20.

She used to walk around the house completely naked, but stopped after my dad got angry and told her it was inappropriate to do that in front of us.

When I was around 16-17, she would force me to sleep in the same bed as her while she was naked. She would hold me against her body, and her genitals would touch my skin. When I told her I didnt like doing that, she would get upset and told me that it was natural. I got scared when she did this to me, and after I told her that I was scared she would rape me she stopped. I feel a lot of guilt for saying this.

Around the same time, I came out to her as a transgender man (and still am a man today) and she didn’t react well. Sometimes she would lightly touch my chest and try to get me to appreciate my female body.

This is all I can remember at the moment. I feel sick and scared when I interact with her sometimes, and I don’t know if it’s really justified.

"I actually can't stand the saying ""Happiness is a choice"".","I constantly see inspirational quotes about how happiness is a choice and it's frustrating to me.

Hear me out:

Yes, of course it’s a choice when life is going well for you because your baseline is already happy. It”s actually EASY to choose happiness when you’re already happy.

But when you are facing a hardship in life or you are feeling depressed- You are not waking up to sunshine and rainbows and butterflies everyday. Choosing happiness might not be in the cards for you when you’re struggling just to make it through the day. And that might not seem fair, especially when you see the people around you enjoying life and living so lightly.

But believe it or not, the struggles you are faced with are fair because in the end they are a damn GIFT. It may not feel like it now, it feels horrible and heartbreaking and hopeless. But slowly but surely each day will get better and you will get through it and become a stronger person.

And let me tell you, when happiness IS finally an option for you again, you will choose it and feel it so deeply in your soul. You will understand WHY you had to lose it in the first place and you will do everything you can to never let that feeling go.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/kqnhjk/i_actually_cant_stand_the_saying_happiness_is_a/,mentalhealth
My girlfriend said “I love you” to her male friend,"My girlfriend is 25 and I’m 19. I had never heard about this guy until now. I looked over her shoulder and this guy is helping her sell something because she is short of money. She texted him “I love you” and he replied “I love you too!”. She said it’s just a platonic friendship. 

She asked me to send a reply because she didn’t know how to spell a word so I scrolled up the chat but not all the way and it was just him trying to help he with selling the product, he’s in her class at university. 

There’s also more signs I think she’s cheating - she constantly accuses me of talking or looking at other girls, and gets mad. She will hit me if she thinks I looked at another girl in public. She will avoid sex and avoid seeing me because she’s “tired” or “ate too much”. Her schedule is always busy etc and when she does meet up she’s always in a mood with me for no reason. Am I right to assume there might be something more going on here?

Why am I listening to a bunch of bullies talking about how much they care about mental health?!,"Our firm has this national wide event called mental illness awareness week. Being in this practice for so long, I was fully aware of the fact that, if anyone ever found out I was diagnosed with depression and had been medicated for 10 years, attempted two unsuccessful suicides and still had mental breakdown from time to time during busy season, I would be isolated by everyone and have no further career progression.

But I am seeing all these perfectly normal individuals talking about their experiences with mental illness mainly because of their family members. What am I supposed to feel?! That our existence hindered their career progression and made their lives miserable? I had enough guilty feeling because of my mom. I can even recognize one of the guest speakers. When I suffered from workplace bully and I talked to him, he did not do anything!

Baby steps with my deep depression,"I have struggled from severe depression since I was 6. I didn't realize this when I was younger, but I realize that one of the signs is not having the will to brush your teeth, not showering, nor being hygienic at all. I struggled with all three of these things. Well, after being on medication, I can say that I am showing daily, brushing my hair, and wearing clean clothes. I am also starting to brush my teeth more. I know this sounds stupid, like how can someone NOT brush their teeth? But, it has been with me so long that if wasn't worth doing anyway. Like the will to do it simply was shattered. So now that I am slowly doing it, I am a little bit happy. 

I have a dentist appointment Friday so I am nervous, but I have been working hard, so I can only hope things are okay. 

I also only now realize how important a clean room is. For the first time in years, I felt pretty. I am struggling with weight, but I put on a cute sweater I had lost, and I did my hair into a messy bun with two little strands to angle my face. I felt so cute, and it was rather weird.

I turned 24 only 5 minutes ago,"Hey, I don't really know where else to post this. My birthday is today, 3/28, and I was planning to kill myself today. I was admitted to the psych ward in August 2021 for a second time for a suicide attempt. When I was released I made a promise to myself if I didn't have my life together or something to live for by my 24th birthday, I would kill myself on that day.
And today is my birthday. I don't have my life together, I live in transitional housing for homeless women, I have a dead end job as a barista, a shit car that is constantly breaking down. I thought I didn't have anything to live for, I'm not in a relationship, I don't have a good relationship with my family, due to my mental illness I have cut ties and pushed everyone out of my life. I don't even have a pet.
But, I realized, I do have something to live for, which is myself. I want to live a life that is kind, bright, and warm. I want to have a future, I don't care if it's even alone, I just want to be happy and loved, even if it's only by myself. Not only am I working to get better, I am looking forward to when I am better.

"After more than 2 years working on a relationship with a person suffering with mental illness, I can say I've reached a place where we both feel deeply happy and in love"," I have a 2 year long relationship with someone diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder. Things have been very hard in the past, but right now, I feel really happy on my relationship and I do envision a long term future with this person. I don't exactly know why I am writing this, but since I feel like sharing a little of my story with the world, I thought it might be useful to someone to read my statement about my experience and journey to where I am now.

Things were really hard in the beginning. My partner was very unstable and deeply depressed, simple things like sleeping or eating were herculean tasks to him that demanded a lot. Huge anxiety was easily triggered, that led to paranoid and intrusive thoughts, specially at night. Sometimes it lasted a couple of days, sometimes it lasted weeks, or a month. I really felt like on the more ""happy"" and stable days I had to take the best advantage out of it so that he felt like ""coming back"" from the pit hole was worth it. I felt like every time we cycled back into a depressive episode he was further and further away from me. I knew I couldn't really do much more than support him and maintain the bare minimum communication he allowed me to have with him but I just kept insisting and insisting because I thought that if I stopped doing so he would just detach completely from everything and everyone.

It was rough. Sometimes the emotional distance between us was so big that I thought I was in love with a man that would never love me. I felt neglected emotionally a lot of the times because I was supporting everything I could but I couldn't really have that back because my partner was living in a ""survival"" mode. When he became more willing to share, our communication also improved, he shared more with me and I learned how to help him better and also how to help myself to not take things too personally sometimes. Also, therapy and medical treatment were of main importance for his progress of course. There's no partner that can cure an illness, it can make it less difficult, for sure, but only the right treatment can really make it better. Fast forward to nowadays my partner works a full time job with quite some responsibility, he has plans for the future with me, he's stable, for the most part, he keeps his medical and therapy appointments on check, and he's happy. I wouldn't be with anyone else but him. I'm more confident than I have ever been, for the first time I feel someone truly sees me. and values me. We're both on our early 20s and starting our careers, I hope we can move in together in the near future, of course there are still bad times, but I do think we are more prepared now to manage the hard times.

I love him deeply, I'm so so proud of him for overcoming so much and that he's no longer suicidal. I am beyond happy he hang on long enough to embrace the person he's becoming and let himself love and be loved too. There's no better feeling in the world than just laying on his chest listening to his heart beating at night before falling asleep, I now it sounds very cheesy, but it's really the truth for me, it does feel like heaven.

If you're on a relationship going with a hard time understanding and dealing with your partner's mental health, I don't mean with this that you should stay and that you should endure all of it because I know how brutal and lonely it can be. Mental illness is devastating for the ones suffering with it, but also to others close to them. On a relationship, it can indeed became unhealthy for both parts to stay together, so, by no means I believe that the answer is always to stay. I only want to say that sometimes, it takes time and work, but things do get better, a lot better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jegd7z/after_more_than_2_years_working_on_a_relationship/,mentalhealth

She kept going with them as it was all her friends (but it was only the boy who called her over and cut me off) and i didn’t want to seem possessive so I kept telling her to go over.

 And then i started to get really mad (i was already not right in my head) and started shaking with anger and thinking of what he done. Then we were standing and i said we had to go somewhere and she said ‘okay’ whenever he came over and said she had to come with him somewhere else without me.

 I flipped and punched him and started shouting at him that ‘he isn’t allowed to act like he’s better than me after raping her’. Police got involved and took me off him but now they had to tell her mother who is now depressed because of it and she still doesn’t want to lose him as a friend and now her whole freindgroup is split up alienating the boy. 

Her whole life and her families life is now ruined and it’s my fault and i don’t know what to do to help and the guilt is crushing me. I can’t cope with it and i have no one to help me as i have no friends and i can’t ask her for help as she’s having to go through it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/16vntu9/i_ruined_my_girlfriends_life/,mentalhealth

I tore my ACL in August a few days before my 18th birthday and she's been here for me through the whole healing process, but in January of this year she lost two grandfathers and it's been hard for her. She's been so stressed but has always had a smile and a kiss for me through it all. She always reminds me how much she loves me and I couldn't ask for anything better.

I tried to hang myself this morning.,"I tried hanging myself with a belt this morning in my apartment. Couldn't find a place to actually hang from so it was more like intentional strangulation because I was just kind of sitting on the floor of the closet with my back against the door.  I really thought I was going to go through with it. Things got all blurry, but my heart started racing. I honestly felt more at peace in that moment than I have in years. Then my cat started scratching at the door behind me. The closer I felt myself to passing out, the more she started scratching. Listening to her frantic scratching is not what I wanted to hear in my last moments. And it kept reminding me that there was something that cared about me. It made me feel so guilty and horrible. Just added to the bullshit. But I love my cat and my husband and my friends but I am so tired. My job has sucked the life out of me for the last 4 years and I can't take the stress anymore. I feel like they'd be happier not having to worry about me anymore. Its almost like I'm mad at these people (and cat) for caring so much about me. It makes this process take so much more thought and deliberation. All of which I thought I had done beforehand this time. I want to cry for help but I can't because it makes me feel like even more of a burden. I'm only 26 why the hell am I like this. Im so mad. Sure my life hasn't been the greatest but it sure as hell hasn't been as bad as it could have been. I hate feeling all of these things. I'm in therapy and taking an antidepressant but I don't feel like anything is working anymore. I feel like my mind just won't stop. Ever. My coping skills don't always work and I'm tired.

She said I’ll never get my licence, have a job or get married because I have learning disabilities

She was my teacher from 8-10 years old.

I had her because I had inflamed ears which weren’t diagnosed until I was 6 and didn’t get fixed until 8 years old.

It gave me learning difficulties as I couldn’t hear and I needed grommets and other ear treatments performed.

I’ll never forget me telling my support teacher “I have sore ears , I can’t read this book” and she said “don’t trick me, you obviously don’t like this book I’ll get you another one” 

When she returned my ears where running blood like a tap as my ear drum perforated.

She was always so mean to me.

Learning this information made me feel really insecure, idk why my mum told me.

I’m now 31, with a licence, two degrees, I was top of the class in my latest degree, have a great job, Im married and I’m pregnant expecting my first child in my own home with my husband.

My mother told me to find somewhere else to kill myself.,"Last night, during an hour-long completely one-sided tirade, my mother screamed that when I kill myself, not to do it in the house, because she didn't want to deal with the mess.

I was already building the resolve to commit suicide throughout her rant. I got hit with the typical ""you're not depressed, you're lazy"", and all the related tropes about how my situation is all my fault and anything she's doing is just in response to me ""hurting"" her by existing.

I've posted about my situation here before, and to be honest I'm extremely surprised I made it this long. But when my own mother's response to knowing I am suicidal is to tell me not to get the carpets dirty, I'm feeling like it's time to cash out.

I WENT TO THERAPY FOR THE FIRST TIME,"I had my first therapy session today, and I feel alive. Does that sound weird? 

It was mostly a what do I want to get out of the sessions, kinda thing - cause I'm nearly 18, and it's a child mental health service thing (5 - 18), so we only have about 4 months. 

But it was really therapeutic in a way, even if I was just outlining some of my struggles and basic battles I have with myself daily. Some of the things I said, she shook her head at, like when I said I have no reason to be scared of the fights in my house, cause I'm used to it lol. But yeah...

We came to the conclusion together, that I am fed up of being judged, and wanna change that and the hypocracy in my family. I just don't know how. We agreed that fixing that will hopefully mean I dont have the need to hurt myself, or lash out involuntarily. But that's only gonna be noticeable after a while. So can't comment on that right now.

My dog has no clue he saved my life,"My little homie has no idea what he did.

I have always found it hard to reach out for help, always worrying about being a burdon to others, even when they said they were open.

Around March I had gotten back from a class trip which I had made some friends, opened up to people, and had a great going social life, something I always struggle with. But as you know what happened in March had some different plans.

My school was closed off, the only way I had contact to these people, I had a couple friends numbers, but didn’t really see them and drifted a bit apart.

I was plunged back into a state of loneliness I felt like I had no one, I still had peoples contact info, but being autistic means I extremely struggle with reaching out. This caused me to spiral

Thoughts of un worth, fear, and trapped filled me. I was a shell.

It came to a head when after long suffering I thought, this needs to end. I walked out of my room wondering the quickest, and painless way to end it.

I looked over and saw something, my German shepherd chilling on his bean bag. I curled up on the bag and vented, cried, and he just listened.

In the end, I left the beanbag feeling as though I am worthy of life. I had already tied a noose, I had access to knives, but little drago was there.

He had no idea, he didn’t pull me out of a fire, he didn’t fight off a bear, but by just being there he saved me.

It’s been over half a year now, I’ve learned to talk more. I’ve even for the first time in a long time, invited someone out. Im now indulging in my love of bikes and engineering. I’ve healed, I’m now even starting to accept my neurodiversity and masking less.

All this improvement wouldn’t happen if the family German shepherd wasn’t sitting on the bean bag that night. He has no idea what he did.

I cleaned my appartment and invited someone over!,"I struggle with anxiety and depression, I haven't eat a proper meal (only bread and crisps) in a whole week because I can't gather the courage to cook, I just lay in bed all day doing nothing (it's even too hard to watch TV shows, or youtube videos) and only get up to pee and smoke cigarettes.

Two days ago I had a phone call with my psychiatrist, she increased my meds again and gave me a few recommendations. Among them, she suggested I see a friend IRL. I don't have any friends in the city where I study, only an acquaintance from my marine biology courses.

Just after hanging up with my psychiatrist, I sent this acquaintance a weird message, proposing her to come over. I'm not really sure why but she accepted, and even seemed happy!

So yesterday, even if I didn't really feel like it, I cleaned my whole appartment, put on nice clothes, and I even went grocery shopping (I usually hate that, it drains too much of the few energy I have lol).

She came on the afternoon. We made some snacks together, and ate them watching a movie. I had feared a lot it would be awkward because we don't know each other a lot, but it was really fun!

I was super exhausted after that (and went directly to sleep at 6pm, oops), but also super glad I did it!

And in bonus, I had some snacks leftovers I ate for diner (when I woke up at 11pm, but still), and a clean appartment!

Driving around for hours listening to Nine Inch Nails and getting pulled over by the military police has been an oddly enlightening experience.,"I'd even go so far as to say spiritual, and I do *not* consider myself spiritual or religious (anymore).

I was feeling like shit today, borderline suicidal, and since I'm living with my parents for the time being, I had to get out of the house to feel through my emotions in private. And it was just... the most compelling feeling of peace I've experienced in a long time. Something about the music throbbing while I drove through a really heavy fog, only car on the road, with the streetlights glowing pretty colors through the mist, just got my thoughts flowing freely again.

I won't jump the gun and say I'm cured, but I did just resist some self destructive habits once I got home, and I'm now doing the coursework that I've been putting off at risk of failing out of school because I *just. didn't. have the energy for it*... So even if I wake up next week and I'm worse off and I feel silly for being optimistic, at least I got a precious window of peace and lucidity that helped me to at least pass the semester.

Oh, and getting pulled over! So, I was so absorbed with my thoughts, I was doing the drive on autopilot thing - see and react to things like red lights and sudden movements, but not really think about where I'm going. I was just navigating by instinct and I ended up going too far on a road and heading for the military base just outside town. Turns out, military cops don't really like it when you suddenly show up to their gates in the middle of the night with a car full of mysterious boxes (haven't fully unpacked yet), then suddenly freak out, turn around, drive on the wrong side of the road for a minute, then correct yourself and try to leave thinking nobody saw you being silly and stupid.

Anyway, the guy that immediately pulled me over was... just a really, really genuine human. He asked me how my night was going and I just explained the whole thing, the need to get out and clear my head, the reason I was too distracted to see the big ass signs about it being a military base (that's also due to the fog, it was incredibly thick, in my defense). Sounded like an absolute nervous wreck. And he listened. And he was really empathetic, just letting me off with a warning.

The funny thing is, I spent a while beating myself up, thinking ""man, this guy must think I'm some huge kind of stupid weak kid. He's a responsible ass adult, working a job in public safety, and here he is, having to chase down a stupid kid with a panic issue. All because *I* can't properly process my feelings.""

But I considered it for a bit, and I realized that this random cop, who doesn't owe me anything, who's shift I rudely interrupted, saw me in one of my worst states and still had it in him to treat me kindly and *listen* to me. Actually *listen* to what I was going through. And I realized that I haven't been doing that for myself.

Guys, see, I need to treat myself with the same empathy and sincerity that this cop treated me with. I need to listen to myself, and forgive myself \~\~even\~\~ *especially* when I'm in my worst states. Because the only way to leave those states is with love and support, and 90% of the time, when I'm not lucky enough to have this cop around, I need to provide that love and support for myself.  I think, for the first time in a long time, I can cut the cynicism for one little moment and tell myself *it's gonna be okay...* and actually mean it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/gi96dv/driving_around_for_hours_listening_to_nine_inch/,mentalhealth

"""Your child, your rules"" is single-handedly the most stupid saying I have ever heard","Now, I am speaking from experience when I say that this statement does wayyyyyy more harm than it ever did good. My mother is an abusive POS, father was even worse before he was divorced. Routinely, I would go to over to videos on subreddits and just watch some posts there. I recently saw a post about parenting, and people in the comments all had the same general consensus that ""your child, your rules""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Problem is, no one really gets all the possible ways that this could be applied. Sure, it is usually used for logical stuff like what religion the child is associated with or maybe whether the child is a vegetarian or a meat-eater. But have you thought this saying through? You're saying that it is this person's child, and that they should be able to make the rules. You are putting this person on one of the most dangerous power trips ever. Now, what would you do if you found out this person over/underfeeds their child? What if they feed the child too much junk, or strictly healthy foods without letting them have any junk food? What would you do if, whenever the child speaks up, they shut them down and go on a tangent before mentioning ""I'm your parent!""? Now do you see where I'm coming from? Look, that was pretty much my story, so I hope you really listen to what I'm saying. I'm 15 years old and I could tell you that shit is damaging. I don't need anyone going through something similar because people keep using this idiotic statement.   


  
And yes, I know this sounds like a giant hyperbole, but it really isn't. Think about it, if you're living with the mentality that ""this is my child, I set the rules for them and no one else"" you are most likely going to turn out as an abusive/narcissistic parent. It's a terrible lesson to be spreading on these subreddits, and are most of the time not even warranted. Being a parent means nothing more than you contributed to the birth and growth of this child, and you are not at all entitled to jack shit if you betray that initial trust.

You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?,"I remember feeling pretty smart when I was a kid. Maybe that's just how all kids feel but that's what I remember – getting better grades than most other kids. During my teenage years I didn't work very hard and still got good grades. I even got accepted into a school that only took on students that got good grades. That's when things started to change. Everyone seemed so much smarter than me and it was really scary. I went from feeling like one of the smartest guys in the room to the dumbest – and I'd let myself know just how dumb I was, beating myself up.

Soon, I wasn't just stupid, I was boring. Then I was ugly and weak and pathetic in the eyes of everyone. I felt like I was getting dumber.

I lasted two and a half years at uni before the suicidal thoughts started to become a real plan. Scared, friendless and far from home, I decided not to go through with it one night – the worst night of my life. Instead I called my mom late that night and early the next morning I was on a train home.

Since then, I've been living with my mom. I work as a waiter and the job sees a high staff turnover with a majority of people working there being students trying to earn some money in between their studies. I can feel them judging me when I tell them that it's all I do – I'm not doing this part time while I chase my dreams. I don't have anything else going on. I'm a 25yo man living with his mom and working a minimum wage job.

I got help, of course – talking to some professionals and taking pills – but the thoughts never really left. I know I'm not supposed to indulge them. My therapist told me, *you wouldn't say those things to your best friend so why would you say them to yourself?* I would reply that my best friend isn't trying to sabotage and fuck up my life. But I was never trying to do that and yet I felt like I deserved to hear the the things I was telling myself and deserved the life I now had because of how stupid and pathetic I was.

Recently, after doing something stupid but totally forgivable and human, I googled 'Is it possible to get dumber?' The first result was the question: *Is it psychologically possible to get dumber* on Quora. One of the answers by Norma Pellett:

> My experience tells me yes. I know a woman who was articulate and educated. I moved away and saw her again after ten years. She had no opinions of her own and couldn't articulate a decent sentence.

> I asked other friends if she had been ill or in an accident. No, she hadn't. Then I heard her husband talking to her. He called her ”stupid” and told her what she was doing was idiotic. He berated her for several more minutes. She was so cowed by this abuse that she bought into his assessment of her intelligence.
> She became what he expected her to be.
> I was too young and unsure of myself to call him on it or even to try to find a way to help her. I am ashamed that I didn't do anything.
> I'm not even sure that thirty years ago people really thought of emotional abuse as abuse. There were no bruises or broken bones, but this was much worse.
> Don't spend any time with someone who puts you down — not even if they say, “just kidding” or “can't you take a joke?” Months and years of this “humor” can destroy anyone.

Abuse is a terrible thing and I don't want to diminish it or its victims but I couldn't help but compare the husband to the voice in my head. The abuse I put myself through. I imagine having another person tell you those things is a thousand times worse.

I have always thought that a smart person was smart no matter what. That they may not believe it and people might tell them otherwise but they were, unchangeably, smart. Maybe it's obvious to everyone else but it never occurred to me that people could become the person they were told they are. That their personality could be moulded. What my therapist should have told me is *You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?* Thinking of it that way it's hard to feel like I deserve it. There is not a person in the world that I believe deserves abuse.

So how to stop? It's important not to try telling yourself the opposite of the things you usually tell yourself. I'm not going to look in the mirror every day and tell myself I'm smart, confident, handsome etc. That just feels inauthentic and quite silly. What you have to do instead is learn to recognise the thoughts and externalize them – think of them as not your own but rather your anxiety's or your depression's. Your illness is your own personal abuser. Then the next step will be to stop believing the thoughts by not giving them your attention. Don't think the opposite or try to argue with them (e.g. *I'm not ugly I'm beautiful*) instead, try to refocus on whatever it is you were doing. This is hard but can get easier with practice. Mindfulness meditations help. You can even try talking back to the thoughts as though you aren't taking them seriously, *Thanks anxiety, tell me that again! C'mon that's what you always say. Ha, that's a good one. I was hoping you were going to show up.*

I feel so far behind everyone else but I'm going to really try getting better this time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/c647ep/you_wouldnt_emotionally_abuse_another_person_so/,mentalhealth
I think people who make jokes/say that people need to “man up” or “grow a pair” or “be a man” are part of the problem.,"


My friend tried to commit suicide last night. I watched him drive away in his car drunk and he went on the highway/motorway saying he didn’t care if he died. Tried to stop him but couldn’t. That’s not the issue though. 

I had no idea he was suicidal, his family had no idea he was suicidal, his friends had no idea. He’d kept his mouth shut and let these feelings fester. 

The conversation about male mental health is nowhere near what it needs to be. It is heading in the right direction sure, but at the moment it only seems to be a big deal when someone is on the brink of suicide or having severe depression. 

There is no emphasis on normal day to day life, people telling young boys to man up if they are upset. Saying be a man. This is vile behaviour and forces boys to stuff down their feelings and deal with it through anger since they feel they can’t talk it through. Even saying it to girls shows them that this is how they should act and that boys should act differently when it comes to feelings. 

In the US four times as many suicides are by males. 9% have daily anxiety or depression. Of those 9% only a quarter found help for it according to the national health survey 2010-13
Source: https://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/12/numbers

In the UK 76% of suicides are carried out by males and 12.5% men are affected by depression. Of the people that seek help through therapy only 36% are men. Then the most shocking stat from the UK, of all the things that kill men under 45, getting hit by a car, murder, heart attacks etc, the leading cause of death is suicide. I am an under 45 male in the UK and to know that the most likely way for me to die statistically is for me to kill myself is shocking and scary. 

Only 15% of men report they would take time off work to focus on mental health. 34% would feel embarrassed or ashamed to do so for a mental health issue compared to the 15% feeling ashamed for a physical injury. 38% would feel that their employer would look down on them for taking time off for a mental health issue compared to the 26% for a physical.

Even among my friends this sort of “man up talk” happens where if a guy gets upset over something deemed trivial he gets told to stop being a girl. I personally am quite sensitive, when I get super angry I tend to tear up. I hate it because it sometimes weakens my argument but it’s just how I am. When I get angry I tear up. It’s not a “sad cry” I’m just angry. 

 I had an argument with a close female friend and she said “I’m only joking, so stop crying and grow a pair, man up”. That says my feelings aren’t allowed because I’m male, because apparently I’m not supposed  to feel that way. I should be calm and collected at all times. But all that does is make my squash my feelings away and deal with them some other way. 

That other way can turn into depression and eventually suicide. 

We need to change the mental health conversation so that it’s not a conversation about men on the brink of suicide. I’m aware that it isn’t only aimed there but at the moment to me it feels like not enough is focused on males feeling  like they *can* talk their problems through with people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/c44zo9/i_think_people_who_make_jokessay_that_people_need/,mentalhealth

Religion used to mess with my mental health SO MUCH,"There is just so much guilt. Guilt for not praying. Guilt for not fasting. Guilt for feeling sexually attracted to someone. Guilt for masturbating. Guilt for eating certain foods. Guilt for dressing a certain way. Guilt for things that are in no way hurting another human being. Guilt for everything.

I left religion some 6 or 7 years ago and I'm not gonna pretend my mental health is perfect right now, but letting it go has helped me let go of so much unnecessary guilt.

I still get anxious and jittery for no reason. And I still have days where I don't really feel like getting out of bed. But at least I don't go into a downward spiral and make things worse for myself by also shaming myself for missing prayers by not getting out of bed.

I did something today that I haven't done since 2019,"I folded my laundry.

Just about one year ago, my OCD caused me to suffer (another) complete mental and emotional breakdown/collapse, culminating in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. Being in such an unstable state is one thing, but then being quarantined and unemployed made things...dark. Horrific, really. I spent every waking and sleeping moment in bed, trying to escape the confines of my own mind. I would go a week without showering, wearing the same sweats and t-shirt every day. I very nearly attempted suicide again.

Before the day I ""broke"", I had emptied my dresser and closet, and did a giant wash of almost every item of everyday wear I owned, clothes for all seasons. And for the next year, they lay in assorted baskets strewn across the laundry room, untouched and unexplored. I've started coming around to stability and normality over the past month, and today decided to finally take a step out of the darkness, and fold my god damn laundry.

And it feels amazing.

I don't mean to sound braggy or anything...I guess I just wanna say that things can better and the small victories can be really powerful and uplifting. The dark times seem eternal--but with hard work, therapy, meds, faith, support, family and friends--whatEVER aids your mental health journey--things CAN get better. Even in times such as these.

"My ""friend"" sexually harrassed me","So I went to his place to eat and then at first he started tickling me and then later it went much further than that all because I didn't want to cuddle.

When I refused to cuddle he was ""hurt"" by it especially after he bought me food.
As for tickling I easily thought him off with my legs at first and he commented how strong I was and what the hell was that.
So later on he restrained my movement by sitting on me. He even held my hands above me that it had left a mark.
He did touched everything that he's not supposed to and even choked me.
He lept saying how my body was reacting differently from what I was saying.
I kept telling him to stop and kept telling him no. 
When I told him I didn't consent to sny of that he told me to then give him my consent. 
And that went on for more than half an hour.
Slowly step by step.
When I was about to leave he grabbed me from behind and ended up taking half my bottom clothes off.
Only when I was really shaking and was about to cry did he really stop.He kept apologising and didn't  let me leave.He kept going after me.
He even asked me what can he do for me to forgive him.He did buy me a new tank top and shorts but he himself even said how that's not enough to make up for it.
Idc if he's really sorry,he shouldn't have done that.
I'm reporting him to police tommorrow.

I wish people understood or cared about the psychological damage of small penis shaming.,"Growing up a boy, society repeatedly makes sure you understand a few things about being a man. On for those things is that a man is supposed to be big. Both in height, but especially in penis size. You see that any man who's small is to be treated with ridicule and scorn. And you see that men with big penis are treated with admiration and praise.

It's been 7 years since mine was referred to as a ""*pencil dick*"" by a woman (not to my face, but to a friend who thought I should know). I don't wanna go into the personal depression spiral I went through, being convinced I was sexually unlovable, but I will say it's not 7 years since, and I'm still deathly afraid of getting naked with a woman. I just don't feel safe.

I know the world will never change. No matter what forms of body shaming become publicly wrong to do, small penis shaming will remain a good, popular and acceptable form if body shaming. So my struggle is maintaining some form of self -worth, when I'm constantly reminded how worthless and inadequate having a small penis makes a man, when I hear people laughing at small penis jokes, as if it really does make us deserving of ridicule.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/15vbr66/i_wish_people_understood_or_cared_about_the/,mentalhealth

My Parents Punished me for Having PTSD," I had been sexually abused by my grandfather for 3-4 years, literally all of my early childhood - I do not have a single memory before him abusing me. My parents found out after constantly punishing me for masturbating (in my room), wetting the bed, having outbursts, etc. There was legal action taken, I was in counseling for the bare minimum time. 

 I had horrible nightmares, night terrors, I sleptwalked. My parents literally punished me for getting out of bed and waking my mom (who was a stay at home mom with all of her kids being in school for 8 hours out of the day) up because I had nightmares that made me feel terrified, paralyzed, and unable to go back to sleep. 

 On one specific occasion, I remember being in the 3rd or 4th grade (only 1-2 years after the abuse had ended) and waking my mom up because I had a nightmare about dolls trying to kill me. My parents were so mad that my dad made me sleep with the light on in an attempt to make it where I couldn't sleep, when I did fall asleep that night he came in and intentionally woke me up telling me I didn't deserve to be asleep, I was going to learn a lesson about waking my mom up, and that he hoped I didn't sleep all night (I had school the next morning). On top of all of that, they made me stay home from a party that everyone else got to go to (my mom stayed home with me). When they got back my sister had brought me candy, he said I wasn't allowed to have it. He also made a point of saying how everyone asked where I was and he told EVERYONE why I couldn't be there, and he made me feel guilty for my mom not being able to go and having to stay home. 

  I confronted my mom about it today (I'm 24) and she just immediately started saying the typical, ""Oh yeah we get it, we're terrible parents, your childhood was terrible."" She then kept saying I never told them I was having nightmares even though I remember ALWAYS telling them about my nightmares and the only time I didn't get punished was the night I had a nightmare about someone shooting my family because that was deemed realistic enough to be afraid. I told her all I wanted her to do was apologize and she full out said she will never apologize and to leave her alone.

  I got frustrated and sarcastically asked if they were never told I would have PTSD after being abused my entire childhood, she said no. So I asked if they seriously didn't have enough common sense to think maybe their child was traumatized and she said no. 

  My parents were so focused on making me ""normal"" that they traumatized me worse than that abuse ever did and they won't even acknowledge that they did anything wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jp6m2x/my_parents_punished_me_for_having_ptsd/,mentalhealth

And I have a girl that I really like but I act "" Nonchalant"" to keep my feelings safe which instead honestly pushed her away even more. I hate TikTok and what it's done to me and I'm starting a new leaf without TikTok or Instagram. I substituted TikTok for YouTube and I watch videos but idk if that's an issue or not.

I'm finally off my anti-depressants after 8 years. I'm now 31.,"Big news! Super amazing news actually. 
For the first time in 8(ish) years I'm no longer on anti-depressants!! *uproarious applause* 

They're now totally out of my system and its crazy how different I feel!

The only satisfactory way to describe it is like Ive had tinted glasses and ear plugs in and now they're off!

The be more specific I was on SSRIs. Basically my brain doesn't make enough serotonin and they kept it active in my brain for longer before the chemical found its final destination. 

Coming out of winter and into a more active schedule is really helping and I have high hopes for me and my brain. 

I'm really pleased and i wanted all of you lovely people in internetland to be pleased too!

I'm 31 now, and I started them when I was 23 so this is definitely new ground for me - infact I have a lot of people in my life who have never known me without their affect on me, so it feels kind of like I (and they) will be meeting a new shiney Fred. 

Anyway, go me!

If anyone has any questions or anything, to do with mental health im happy to share my experiences (such as they are) with you if it'll help provide any insight into helping your own. ❤

Edit 1: I still go to my counselling session every week. 

Edit 2: I still use the coping mechanisms I've learned. I'm also giving myself tons of patience and elbow room. I eat the chocolate, and i take breaks, and I talk myself down or up as I need.

I ate and didn't purge for the first time in 2 weeks. So happy!,"I have purging disorder, which is purging but no binging, like half-bulimia and half-anorexia, for half a year already. After my high school graduation, my depression and anorexia onset were so bad I purged every single thing I ate. Today I did a long workout and then ate a light meal. It's been so long since I last ate and actually kept food in my stomach. I'm so happy about this. Even though my workout burnt way more calories than I ate, I'm still proud of this little achievement.
The only concern I have now is that I have partially starved myself for quite a long time, so my body will kind of store what I ate as fat because it doesn't know when the next starvation will come. Now I'm trying to purge less, eat a little, and workout a lot.

"people only care about mental illnesses that are cute, quiet, and make it easy to pity you. do you agree?","when my only diagnosis was depression and anxiety, i was easily pitied and white knighted. either by boys who thought being suicidal and helpless was sexy or with half assed attempts from mental health workers / volunteers. 

well my bpd symptoms got worse. instead of sulking when i am feeling self doubt or low self esteem i immediately project and lash out. this comes from a place of extreme pain and years of trauma but because it is a stark contrast to the inwardness of depression i rarely get the same attitude i did when i didn’t mention bpd symptoms. i see it constantly - no regard for anger as a mental health symptom in support communities, pointing fingers and calling the aggressive psychopathic, etc. 

people will advocate when you’re all cute and quiet and tiny and not making any noise. once your mental illness becomes external and your pain manifests into outbursts and aggression it’s completely dismissed and the person is disregarded and abandoned. 

this is why i am so afraid of having bpd. but that’s beside the point. i was wondering if you guys had any experience with this phenomenon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/oplezp/people_only_care_about_mental_illnesses_that_are/,mentalhealth

A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness," 

A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness,

If you are reading this as one of **many** who doesn’t understand what it’s like to deal with mental illness, I am very happy you don’t experience firsthand what I and so many others have to experience on a daily basis because...

**I would not wish this pain on my worst enemy.**

**I am so happy** you don’t have to experience feeling that no one in your life truly loves or cares about you, despite them reassuring you that they do on almost a daily basis.

**I am so happy** you haven’t had to answer any of the further questions that follow “do you feel anxious or depressed?” when visiting the doctor’s office.

**I am so happy** you have never thought the world is better without you in it.

If you have never had to leave a party because of a sudden wave of anxiety or sadness, *I really hope it stays that way.*

If you are able to get out of bed without feeling nauseous with anxiety or the weight of depression, *appreciate it* every single day**.**

**Don’t ever take it for granted.**

Don’t let a day go by without appreciating how *beautiful* life is and can be. Because many of us, myself included, aren’t always able to see that beauty, no matter how hard we try.

While mental illness is something that is so wrongfully romanticized in the movies, **it is very ugly in real life.** Mental illness is not **“quirky”** or **“poetic”** like society makes it seem on social media.

Being mentally ill isn’t *aesthetic worthy,* mascara filled tears with sad music in the background; mental illness is barely being able to keep up basic personal hygiene because it feels almost physically **impossible** to get out of bed. 

**Mental illness makes the world seem pointless.** 

So when a loved one approaches you seeking comfort or a listening ear, please don’t automatically assume it is an annoying cry for attention. Because I promise you, that assumption is our **worst fear.**

**The last thing we wish for is to be a burden on the ones we love.**

Isn’t it ironic that even when we are struggling, our first thought is to not make our loved ones uncomfortable?

And when we cancel plans or fail to stay around the entirety of a social outing, don’t take it personally.Trust me, we already beat ourselves up for it enough already because we finally put ourselves first for once, even though that is what we should’ve been doing all along. 

When we isolate ourselves from you and push you away, don’t think it is us being rude. We are just trying to do what we can to feel like we aren’t dragging you down with us.

Please do not blame us for the cards we got dealt, we deal with them the best we are able to, even if it means pushing loved ones away to avoid getting hurt. 

Most of all, see mental illness as you would any broken bone or any physical sickness.**It hurts just as bad and is equally out of our control.**So, while we don’t wish you would first handedly understand, we want you to **be patient** and understand the best you are able to.

**We are fighting an invisible illness that we aren’t always sure we can beat.**

However, even with this ongoing battle to stay afloat in our own minds filled with endless thoughts, **not every single day is a bad one.** 

In fact, we go through periods of time where everything feels alright again for a while. So when those good days finally come around, we appreciate it and never take it for granted. 

Because to those who struggle with mental illness, it is a privilege to feel the true happiness that **everyone** deserves to feel every day.

Sincerely,

The mentally ill",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jwz8qk/a_letter_to_those_wanting_to_understand_their/,mentalhealth
We are asking Congress to take action on the mental health crisis in America.,"Hey guys,

We are a group of high school students who are committed to solving the mental health issues of today through awareness and policy. The mental health crisis is one of the most prevalent issues facing the American population today, not only the youth. 

We are also compiling a list of candidate endorsements who are pledging to focus on mental health reform once they are inaugurated.

In fact, 1 in 5 American adults experience some form of mental illness each year (National Alliance on Mental Illness), while only 41% receive proper treatment (Mental Health First Aid). This is unacceptable, and we demand action now.

We’ve witnessed these problems in our own schools and neighborhoods, and we believe it is time for us as a country to step up and pass bold solutions to protect everyday people. 

We are also asking you to sign and share our petition (https://www.change.org/p/u-s-congress-pass-comprehensive-mental-health-legislation-now ) to ask Congress and the President to commit to comprehensive mental health reform to ensure that everyone has access to quality mental health care.

Thank you.

Edit: Thanks for the overwhelming support, we would never have dreamt of getting almost 350 upvotes in only one day. We have just started a GoFundMe in order to raise money to increase the awareness of this crisis on more platforms such as 
Instagram, Twitter, and Google.

My 9-year-old is madly obsessed with me. Any advice?,"&#x200B;

At first it seemed very cute and sweet, like a “Crush” sort of thing. Through this past few years it has been escalating to a point where it is creepy and I fear for her mental health and future safety. I’m telling this story as a way of trying to get some opinions. 

Let’s call her Cindy, she is a daughter of a cousin of mine who I am not that close to, but we still get along pretty well. I’m going to share some anecdotes so you all can see what I mean. 

We come from a family where reunions and parties are common and happen at least once a month. So, we all see each other frequently. Cindy always wants to be around me, she wants me to play with her and hold her every minute of every single reunion. Whenever I dare to hug, say hi, or even acknowledge any other member of the family (especially when it comes to younger females of the family) she would get upset and throw a tantrum, running away onto the streets. Whenever the family starts dancing outside (which is pretty often lol) Cindy makes me pick her up and dance with her. I can only dance with her, no other female is allowed near me, I can’t even put her down to go the bathroom or have a drink. And whenever I did put her down well… temper tantrum time. 

She once smacked her youngest sister (Mia, 2-year-old) so hard it almost knocked her out, just because she was walking around the house, spotted me, smiled, and wanted to get close to say hi. 

Anytime another female of the family would bring me something to eat or drink, she would make me give it back or throw it away so she could go and bring me whatever I had just been given. 

One time I did not show up to one of those reunions because some other plan that sounded more fun came around (dick move I know). Cindy asked everyone a thousand times where I was, and why I wasn’t showing up. Eventually they got tired of her and decided to call me, I explained that I was hanging out with some friends. When they told her about this, she got furious, grabbed a stone and threw it at the nearest car, breaking one of the windows. She then locked herself up inside one of the rooms. 

3 or 4 times a week, Cindy’s mom would call me, telling me Cindy wanted me to come over so I could help her with her homework. Sometimes, her other sister (8-year-old) would ask for my help too, causing Cindy to flip out, throw things at her, and call her names. Whenever I refused the invitation to help Cindy with her hw, she would start ripping her notebooks and textbooks, or pouring water on them. 

She then started to force her parents to bring her to my place every other day, even if it was for a short visit. This One time they left her with me because they needed someone to watch her to do some errands. Cindy was in my room, and I left for a couple of minutes to get her some snacks. When I came back, I found her going thru my clothes. She started crying and said she wanted to steal one of my t-shirts so she could remember me with it. I thought it was kind weird, but cute in a way. I told her she could have one of her choosing. Each time she came over after that she demanded a new shirt to take. I told her I couldn’t give her anymore shirts because I don’t have many. (which is true) Every time she would come, we would have the exact same conversation, until, without me noticing, she took pretty much all my shirts and stuffed them inside her backpack. Her mother had to come back the next day and give them back. 

I used to play along and not say much to her or her mother because, like I said, I thought it just was a “crush” or just a little girl overly attached to an older family member. It escalated gradually to a point which I didn’t know what to do. And besides, I’m really not into confrontation, so I didn’t want to cause any trouble. 

Last time I saw Cindy was this past weekend. (another family reunion) but this time, I brought my new girlfriend with me (she was my best friend for 6 years but I escaped the friendzone haha). Cindy was using crutches because she had gotten injured doing something or other while at school, so she couldn’t follow me around like she usually does. 

Obviously, she got furious when she met my girlfriend, but she didn’t say much. She sat right between us and didn’t let us kiss, hug or dance. Laura (my gf) Went to grab a drink for both of us, and immediately Cindy started moving around so she was occupying the rest of the sofa. When Laura came back, she refused to move and let her sit. I lost my patience (even when I lose my patience, I’m still pretty chill) and told her that she was being mean to my GF and that meant she was also being mean to me. I also told her we (Me and Laura) would have to leave if she kept it up.

Cindy lost it, she started screaming and kicking, she called Laura every name in the book and finished by saying that if we continued being together, she would shoot us both with his father’s gun. Turns out my cousin is not very bright, and it took her this long to realize something might be wrong with her daughter. My cousin pulled me aside and I told her everything, everything I just told you and a lot more. I advised her to seek help for Cindy and told her it was best if I stayed away for a while. 

Im really worried about Cindy and her wellbeing. So please, if anyone has gone thru something similar, or if some of you understand what is going on and what can I do to help. I would gladly listen.

Feeling weird about some stuff my mom did to me and I just want answers.," So, recently I was thinking about some things my mom has done while I was younger, I’m 17F now. She would make me shower with her from 10-13 even though I was showering by myself during this time and she would wash my private parts with her hands, not a wash cloth.

 I felt weird about it but didn’t say anything. I would also lay down in the bed with her and she would start touching my inner thighs but nothing further. Also, she would make me and my brothers rub her feet but she would make weird moaning noises and said that she had a foot fetish. She also made a weird joke about how she would show me what it’s like to get molested and tried taking my clothes off jokingly?? I remember being very uncomfortable.

When I was around 14, I told her that I had a boyfriend and she slammed me on the ground and made me tell her information about him and would not let me go. 

 Also, (last month) I was dealing with issues with constipation and she bought me this laxative device that you have to stick in your butt to do. I have trauma from that era specifically because I was raped in July and she knows that, she even knows that specific area is just a source of trauma. But, she made me take off my pants and kept insisting that she put it in her for me. I kept saying no and that I would do it myself but she kept pushing me. 

I literally was screaming no and she said that my stepdad does it for her all the time. Eventually, I started crying and having PTSD flashbacks so she eventually backed off and apologized. I don’t know what to make of any of this?

My stepdad hasn’t done anything weird but he did make a weird comment about my boobs being out when I was wearing a shirt. I just want help and someone’s thoughts.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/17n0db7/feeling_weird_about_some_stuff_my_mom_did_to_me/,mentalhealth

Is it just me or does life just feel like shit,"Honestly, lately life has just felt well lifeless.  


People are angry at each other from all over the globe. Whether if it's because of politics, the pandemic, race, cops, etc. It just feels like everywhere people are just angry. If they aren't angry then they are most likely depressed given the state of the world and what's been going on. When you think of all those things together it really makes you feel like life has been shit and still is.   


The folks on the news always seem like they are either angry at something or have something negative to talk about. The people around me are uneasy with what's been going on. Jobs have been hard to come by when taking the pandemic into consideration. If you don't want to work with other people because you are scared of the virus that's a huge chunk of jobs you can't get. Even if you get a job it's been tough trying to get a place to live comfortably. The folks I know that have a place either work 90% of their week, have two jobs or are unable to treat themselves because they can't afford to.  


The most frustrating about all this is the lack of attention mental health has been getting. At least on a national level.  All you hear is cases and deaths with very few articles mentioning mental health. When you do they are actually talking about people who have Covid or have had Covid are experiencing depression. Like you can't have mental health issues without Covid? What kind of nonsense is that? Vaccines came out which you would think is something we should be hopeful for the news tries to scare people with ""hesitancy may stop us from going back to normal"".   


Anyways that's all I have to say. I do really hope it gets better, but lately the longer the pandemic drags on I feel it's just going to make people worse and worse.

I'm surprised at how many mental health professionals don't know how to deal with mentally ill people,"I've been in a lot of mental hospitals and I've seen a lot of sick people and the thing I'm always so surprised at is how incompetent the staff is. Most are nice and well meaning people but absolutely clueless and often shocked when people have problems in there.

I remembered once a group of ladies were sitting with some of the staff and chatting about stuff, and another patient was crying hard and obviously having a problem. The staff just pretended to not see what was happening and kept chatting with the old ladies.

Any kind of therapy was aimed at the lowest common denominator, and that's understand but also useless. It was maybe playing word games or reading the safety rules. Nothing helpful.

A <1 minute exercise to connect with your feelings. All you need is a mirror,"Here's a quick experiment if you haven't tried mirror work before.

Let's do this one without too much thinking and rationalizing, OK?

It will be worth it, I promise.

Afterwards, drop a comment or hit reply to share how it felt.

**Before you do this mirror exercise read this**

* Find a mirror where you can be alone and undisturbed
* Then look at yourself. Really, look into your eyesNo preening, no posing
* Breathe slowlyUnclench your jaw
* Ease your shoulders down
* Unclench your toesOne more breath

Now say to yourself:

>I love you  
>  
>I am going to take care of you  
>  
>You're going to be OK

Yes, you can say it out loud.

No overthinking. Just do it.

&#x200B;

**How did it feel?**

How did you see yourself?

Did you feel any tenderness towards the face in the mirror?

Did it feel strange or emotional, or just indifferent?

I don't know about you, but I felt like crying. In a good way.

It felt emotional and tender. Like a step towards accepting and loving myself.

I saw myself as a little vulnerable, but felt lighter afterwards. Like I was going to be OK.

That's why I am sharing this with you.

Making effort with people mentally drains me,"I’ve [24/f] always been terrible at responding to texts, answering phone calls, joining FaceTime group sessions, and being outgoing. I don’t know if it’s some deep rooted fear of rejection or what. I remember when I was younger, I was so so scared of going to peoples doors to ask if they wanted to come out and play, and the one time I mustered up all my mental strength to do it, the mum told me that my friend didn’t want to come outside to play. It sounds like a small thing, but I remember how badly that set me back. 

Now, I’m 24 years old and struggle tremendously with making effort with friends. Sometimes I doubt if my connections with friends is even real, because I act different with all of them. I adapt, and have done for years, and it’s tiring. I’m just at a stage in my life where I want to address what’s going on with me, and try to better myself. My flat mate has just messaged me asking if I want to renew our house contract for next year (which I don’t) and as a result I’ve been suffering from crippling stomach knots all morning and have been running on and off to the toilet. 

I don’t know if any of this makes sense at all? Or if my point is even clear? I just want to know if anyone else experiences this. It would really help to know I’m not alone. What have people done to overcome this?

Just another rape story,"Hello, trapped in quarantine here and nobody to talk to so I’ve chosen to write it out. I (24f) was raped by my own cousin for over a year when I was 14 years old. Story started with force, him moving my hand, forcing my head down, holding me down, locking me in cars, etc. Same things that are pretty common with those raped by family members. What I want to talk about is the aftermath. What nobody really realizes. My virginity wasn’t lost the same way as my friends growing up, I felt my body was meant to be used because that’s all he told me I was good for. So I believed him. After having that happen to you for that long you begin to go numb. It starts out with fighting then when you realize there isn’t anything you can do after fighting screaming and clawing you way out for months you just give in and want to get it over with. I don’t feel like my body is mine, I don’t have a connection with sex. I hear stories of people having sexual partners because they are in love or want to share that with their partners, but I have always viewed sex as my duty. It was my job to make men feel nice, I never had a right to say no. Still feel like I don’t. I don’t have connections with people, every friend I push away because I don’t “fit in” with them. I’m disconnected from what your typical 24 year old would want to do (drink, party, yoga, etc) my focus for the time I’ve grown up is to just make sure it doesn’t happen again. Survivor mentality if you will... I’m not saying all this to feel sorry for myself. It happens to a lot of people. But what happened to me made me feel like a outcast, I can’t share “losing my virginity” stories because it wasn’t funny or cute. I can’t stay in relationships with... well anyone because I don’t trust people because if family can hurt me in that way what’s to stop others. I don’t talk to friends (don’t have any), I’ve lost a lot of my family due to what happened and the family I haven’t lost like my mom, dad, and brother I don’t talk to them anymore because they don’t understand why I’ve changed so much from the happy go lucky “pretty teenage girl” to the cold hearted one I am today. Nobody can help you but yourself. I’ve been told over and over again to “just get over it” but here we are, 10 years later. And I’m over what happened to me, it doesn’t haunt me like it use to. But that doesn’t mean it didn’t permanently change me. My ability to form relationships, my mentality, my hobbies, my happiness, or my thought processes all have been changed because of one person 10 years ago. So for those that have been raped, you don’t have to just get over it, you don’t have to just bury it, but you can build because of it. I’m a strong person because of it, just isolated. So if you guys have any questions like how to help those that have been through it I will try to answer to the best of my abilities as another survivor. Thanks for reading.

Thank you guys for sharing this, I hope it helps those that have been told over and over that it gets better to see from someone that has been through it, it really does get better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hbkbft/just_another_rape_story/,mentalhealth

My cat is the biggest reason why I am sticking around,"I’ve always had anxiety and big depresso my entire life. Started on meds 3 years ago, felt stabilized. But then the pandemic struck and every thing went downhill... it was like spiralling into a dark hole. 

I was never allowed to have cats growing up, although I am a huge cat lover. My parents thought they were stinky, no-good animals. At the beginning of 2021 I felt this huge void that needed to be filled by an animal. A furry companion that would give me a purpose in life to be its care-taker. To make me interested in living again. So I adopted my cat, Pepper.

My parents were absolutely livid. It was probably the worst week of my life, they were yelling at me. Telling me I just need to “be strong” and get over my depression. I felt like a bad person because I disobeyed their house rules. But it was getting to the point where I wanted to die really bad. My meds were upped, I started taking a new pill but the sadness still kept creeping in through the cracks. 

Sometimes I think about admitting myself to a hospital but I think about how I need to be here for him. I want the best life for my boy, he’s been spoiled with so much love, toys, treats, and a tall kitty condo. Everyday I look forward to waking up to feed him or give him pets. 

Pepper might not know it, but his existence is everything to me.

I’m tired of constantly living a life I don’t enjoy,"I struggle from major depression, and I will say that it is getting better. But, I am so tired of spending all day working hard and doing things that make me miserable. I am currently in school and I have a job. I completely understand that working hard, going to school, and holding an unenjoyable retail job is all a part of being a 20 year old. 

But I am completely miserable and I don’t want to waste the years that are supposed to be the best part of my life, waking up everyday and having to do things I don’t care about. 

How do I make my everyday life more enjoyable. I want to live a life I enjoy living. But it’s also difficult to keep up with hobbies because after schoolwork and my job and dealing with the tiredness that comes from depression, I am too exhausted to keep up with hobbies. I just end up mindlessly watching tv.

Getting a dog turned out to be the best thing for my mental health.,"On 4th of July this year, I unexpectedly rescued a German Shepherd mix named Sandi. A friend of mine couldn’t keep her anymore, and Sandi fell into my life.

Not only does she brighten my mood just by being the best dog I’ve ever had, but she helps me through panic attacks, and keeps me from harming myself(I punch and hit myself in the legs and head). I never had to teach her anything, she picked it up all on her own. 

Also, Sandi is one of the only reasons I leave the house, other than work.

I take her on two walks everyday, and the fresh air and little bit of exercise have done wonders for me. My appetite is back up, I’m sleeping better, and my body is starting to feel healthier.

"[Personal victory] For the first time ever, I was able to calm myself down after a panic attack, instead of going crazy in my own head","My SO went out of town last night to go out with the guys. I generally try not to bother him when he’s out doing that because that’s his time to do what he wants. He has not come yet, which is fine by me. However, the one message I sent him asking “is there plans we made for this weekend that I forgot about?”, he has yet to respond to. It’s been six hours since he was last active according to Facebook messenger. 

My panic attack started when I had this insane thought “was he out all night boozing around getting frisky/messing with other women?”. My heart started racing, my mind was running wild, I started to breathe heavier and heavier. I was in this state for about 30 minutes trying to remain calm. 

Finally, I took a deep breath and thought to myself: “If he didn’t cheat on me, I’m worked up for no reason. If he DID cheat, I will deal with him later.” There was nothing I could do at that point in time, because he either did or didn’t do anything. But getting worked up about it now literally does nothing but make me miserable. 

I view this (the calming myself down part) as a personal victory. I’ve never been good at handling panic attacks well when I’m by myself. So I am kind of proud of myself.

I Worry About This Sub,"Day after day, night after night I scroll through my feed to catch up quick and I see so many posts on this sub, mostly genuine people looking for encouragement, empathy, or just to know they're not alone. But looking for that something, that one thing that's gonna turn their struggle around. 

Sometimes a particular post will catch my eye and I'll interact, but for the most part I watch time after time as people, mostly young people, reach out for somebody's hand and no one is there to respond. I don't view this as any one person or group of people's fault, I just think the sheer numbers of those looking for real help overwhelm the number of people qualified and/or willing enough to provide it by such a large margin that a lot of the sub continually consists of largely ignored cries for help. 

I wonder what impact this has on the greater good that all of us try to do for ourselves or other people when it comes to providing mental health care, referrals, and advice. I wonder if there's a way it could be done better by all of us involved not only with our mental health for one reason or another, but with our specific involvement in the sub. I worry about all of our brothers and sisters out there who are in a position where this Reddit sub is all they feel they have.

My depression took my personality,"During my (f 20) teenage years I dealt with depression. At some point during that, it became all I was. As many people know depression can make you loose interest in things that previously interested you.
I lost all my hobbies and a big chuck of my personality. I was a shell.

I've since overcome that part of my life and am left with this same shell. I dont particularly have anything that makes me me anymore. I don't have the patience/strength to really finish anything I start (eg artwork or writing) and when I don't finish it it brings me down more.

Essentialy I don't have a personality. I think I'm very boring and have crippling social skills. I don't know how I would go about trying to fix this.

My lack of social skills (due to isolating myself through arguably the most important part of my life, development wise) has also resulted in me loosing all my friends and unable to reconcile or make new ones.

I figure I can't be the only one going through this or something similar and wonder why this big part of this mental illness isn't really talked about

I let my social anxiety stop me from seeing my Dad for the last time,"My Dad had been fighting cancer for a couple of years and had been going downhill recently. He was admitted to hospital several weeks ago and, due to COVID restrictions, only one person could visit him a day. 

I have severe  anxiety about going into new places, that is manageable when I’m with my boyfriend, but when I’m by myself.... I just cannot cope. The thought of going to the hospital and having to navigate it myself was far too much. 

My dad got moved to a hospice last Thursday for palliative care. 2 people could now visit at a time! But we were so busy with work.... I had planned on going to visit on the Monday but we received a phone call Sunday evening saying he was now unconscious and likely wouldn’t wake up. Immediately, we rushed u but he more than likely had no idea we were there.... he passed away on Wednesday. 

If I had gone to the hospital I would’ve been able to tel him one last time that I loved him. Due to COVID I haven’t hugged this man since February, as even when the restrictions were slackened I didn’t want to risk passing anything onto a shielding person. If I had went to the hospital I could have wrapped my arms around him one last time. 

But my social anxiety held me back. And now I don’t know if I can live with myself.

Edit: I did not expect this to take off even half as much as it has. I want you all to know I have read every single reply and I will respond to each.

I just contacted the suicide hotline.,I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while now and I contacted the hotline once before and it went horribly and I was so scared to contact the suicide hotline again but today I decided to give it another try. I used the chat line because I get too anxious when i have to talk on the phone and the guy was really helpful and he asked me if i had a plan and I lied and told him no because I was afraid of what would happen if I did tell him that I have a plan to kill myself so I told him that I was just having thoughts of suicide and that I didn't have a plan to kill myself. Then we just talked about what was going on and what's making me feeling this way and then we came up with a plan on what I could do tonight to keep myself distracted and busy and he gave me some coping mechanism that I could use. I talked to him for about 40 minutes and he told my that I could always contact the hotline again if the thoughts comes back. Honestly the suicide hotline did help me this time and I felt a little better after talking with them. So if you're having suicidal thoughts don't be afraid to contact your local suicide hotline it might help and if you have contacted the hotline before and have had a bad experience like I did the first time don't be afraid to try again because it kind of stopped me from doing something really bad tonight.,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/j9hazw/i_just_contacted_the_suicide_hotline/,mentalhealth

Today my dad called me and told me he was going to slit his throat with a knife he had in his hand the phone call lasted probably like 45 minutes of him just going into detail about how he was going to kill him self after the phone call and him drinking so drunk. It was so traumatizing to sit there and try to talk my dad down and nothing was working I was begging for him to not do it and how I love him and I had to have my boyfriend call the cops on him while I stayed on the phone... he kept drinking and slamming the drink down and everytime I was terrified it was his body slamming on the floor screaming “dad are you there!? Dad!!! Dad!!! Please!” And him just saying he can’t live and trying to give me information of his life insurance. He’s now in the hospital and I’m waiting till the morning to go talk to him because honestly I was so traumatized by everything I couldn’t go right away and see him like that drunk saying he wants to die.. I want to talk to him sober he’s an alcoholic and depressed and I just feel so bad for not going right away but I’ve had suicidal and depression problems in the past and he was so drunk I don’t think he’d remember me coming so I just wanted to mentally recharge so I can sit him down and talk to him about getting help because I feel like I have to be so mentally strong and be there for him it’s just going to be so hard to see him and have this talk I feel so awful and guilty and scared to say the wrong thing I don’t know how I’m going to find the strength I’m only 22 and he has no one else being that he’s driven many friends away with his alcoholism and all our family lives out the country I’m so desperate for any advice my heart is breaking and I don’t know how I’m going to do it,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/fmb46e/dad_tried_to_commit_suicide_while_on_the_phone/,mentalhealth

You may not be able to tell, but under my clothes are strategically placed scars, the blade scores my skin in places you will never see. You percieve the way I dress as modesty.

I don't shower or change for a week on end. And when I leave the house, my significant other often has to tell me I am wearing something inside out or backwards. Sometimes it takes me a couple of tries, and you see only the end result.

I don't seem like I have schizophrenia, but when in mixed company, I will take excessive trips to the bathroom, just for a moment of silence, because things are a bit too loud. You see someone with an over-active bladder.

It has just been sitting on my phone.  While the message is not a new revelation to anyone, it never hurt to hear someone say these things to me.  So I thought that I would share it.

The path of life is not paved solely in joyous moments, there are twisted unknown parts that lead us through the darkest of forests, hills that seem insurmountable, rivers that we cannot ford, and past demons that others cannot see.⁣⁣


We cannot make this journey alone and we should not try.  We must know, and remind others, that there is always an ear that will listen, a hand to offer aide, a back to share the load, and a shoulder to cry on.  No one must ever think that they need to face these challenges alone.  Call on others and find the strength you need in them.⁣


Please know that I love you and that no matter the challenge ahead of you I will stand beside you.  Please do not think it will ever make you lesser by asking for help, it makes you stronger than you know.

It's difficult to talk to her because I never know if my feelings are...real or if i'm just imagining them/being too dramatic about them.

It's so hard to answer questions about ""*and how does that make you feel?""* And ""and what do you think about this thing that happened?"" And ""why do you think that is?"" and ""what do you mean when you say that?"" and ""describe your feelings when...""

I don't know what to say or even think when the therapist asks me these. Every time I answer, clumsily and feeling fake while doing ir, the words sound silly and ..like i'm overreacting. And then...my head starts to doubt itself.

My internal monologue starts diminishing what i've just said THE MINUTE I say it out loud. ""You're being very dramatic"" ""Is this true though?"" ""Are you sure the therapist isn't laughing at you right now? She probably thinks you're undeserving of the help but she wants the money"" ""your mom would say you're being ridiculous right now."" ""Your problems are stupid compared to [x]""

I was finally accurately diagnosed after 12 years thanks to the show 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend'," 

Throwaway account for reasons that may be obvious and a **Spoiler** for season 3 of the show.

Let me start off by giving you guys some backstory. I have been in therapy for a wide array of issues: Compulsive spending, depression, anxiety, manic episodes, suicidal attempts. I attempted many times to get a diagnosis but I wouldn't share any embarrassing details that I will share with you. Every psychiatrist I would see would base these disorders off as the result of childhood trauma and an absent father. I was on all the medications you’ve probably heard of Buspar, Prozac, Xanax, and Zoloft. 

My relationships have never really been stable in both interpersonal and romantic areas. I’ve had 3 romantic relationships my entire life with the longest relationship lasting 6 months. Whenever I developed feelings for someone it would turn into severe infatuation where it went as far as stalking, rearranging my work schedule to be able to interact with him, and try to change my physical appearance in order to get them to fall for me. I am not proud of any of this but I need to stop denying that this was happening. With friendships, whenever a friend would cancel plans like drinks at the bar I would fall into a severe depression where suicidal thoughts would come to mind. I would call these friends and tell them I was considering suicide in order to get them to come see me. 

My manic episodes started getting pretty severe over the past few months to the point where I would take a week off from work and take lavish spontaneous trips to Europe, I started having auditory hallucinations of a ‘sane me’ insulting me and calling me crazy. I would go to Vegas on weekends to go on an alcohol binger and have numerous random sexual encounters. I would also lock myself in my room after work and watch TV for 6 hours straight. I will admit, I was too ashamed to open up about this as I was scared of being institutionalized and being known in my family as the freak.

In August, I wanted to start watching a new show and came across the show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. I had heard of the show before but because of the name I thought it was related to the meme I had grown annoyed of so I never really gave it a chance. As I started watching I was horrified that there were a few similarities between myself and the character Rebecca Bunch, the stalking, lavish spending, fear of abandonment, the hallucinations. The fact that she was the titular “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend” left me in a slight depression and I almost stopped watching. However when I reached season 3 where Rebecca finally gets diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I decided to finally go to a new psychiatrist to get another opinion and decided not to hold back any information that I was scared would be regarded as ‘crazy’ people behavior. Thanks to the show’s portrayal of mental illness, I was finally able to open up about the stalking, the auditory hallucinations, and everything in between. After 12 years of therapy my official diagnosis is Self-Destructive Borderline and while the road to recovery will be a long one, I am hopeful that someday I will be able to completely manage my BPD. If you're currently going through something similar know that you aren't alone and the medical professionals are there to help you not judge you.

TLDR; Was an undiagnosed Borderline for 12 years but thanks to the show’s portrayal of mental illness I finally opened up about topics I was ashamed to admit, finally getting an accurate diagnosis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9uie1q/i_was_finally_accurately_diagnosed_after_12_years/,mentalhealth
Do men go thru something in their 30s-40s that affect their emotions?,"Husband (35) stated he feels numb/Doesn’t care about anything. He said he doesn’t feel love toward anyone and we have kids. He tries for our kids but he says he doesn’t feel nothing for them either. He said he doesn’t hate his life or isn’t mad or sad. He doesn’t want to hurt himself he just said he’s content but not happy. He’s going to therapy but therapist says he’s not depressed it’s something that happens to men in their 30s-40s. It just something that triggers in them and they are the only ones to figure it out BUT that sometimes they never come out of it. My husband was never like this. He was always loving and affectionate towards me and our kids. My husband is the only one working and works almost everyday so I thought this is what caused it but he said no that it’s just turning 35 and seeing people around him dying or getting sick from old age. His therapist told him to take a trip alone for a week and that is what he is going to do. I don’t know Is anyone going thru this or knows what this is? If so can people get better?

So we are divorcing. He told me he wants to sleep with other women on his vacation so I’m done with him.  I’m going to keep this post up since it gives people a chance to share there stories.

I lost it over my son's hair,"Yesterday, I noticed that my son had been chewing on a lock of his hair. No big deal lots of kids do that. I explained why he can't and that we need to trim some of his hair to deal with the damage he did to it. It was pretty torn up in one spot. His is super proud of his long hair. It was down to the middle of his back when it is wet and to his shoulders dry because of his curls. 

My mom when to beauty school years ago and offered to cut it for me. I was very hesitant because my family jokes about cutting his hair behind my back. I told her to only cut it to his shoulders but she gave him basically her hair cut which it the short old lady cut that she and my grandma have. It looks awful and I asked her to stop but she kept insisting that she needed to even it out. 

By the time she was done I was in tears. I ran out to the car to calm down so the kids didn't see me cry. My mom came out and made jokes about how I'm not speaking to her and laughed and asked if she could cut my hair next. 

I took the kids home and fed them and attempted to put his hair in his braids that I always do but it is too short. I had a full meltdown after the kids when to bed and basically hyperventilated on my kitchen floor. I'm so angry that my chest hurts and I asked my son after I was calm what he wanted to do with it and he said ""please, don't take any more of my hair."" I know I'm more upset then he is.

There’s something beautiful about this quote,,https://i.redd.it/i8546fs7lxn01.jpg,mentalhealth
Did my mom sexually assault me? Its not sexually motivated by it definitely felt violating.,"My mom has always been sadistic towards me. She would drag me by the hair and cut it like a maniac as some punishment then tell me how ugly i look, or she would watch me throwing up on the floor and not help cos I’m being punished. However, there are instances when i do something that “would dishonour” the family? She would try to strip me down infront of my own brothers, violently pulling at my clothes while i try to cover myself. One time she told me to get naked and bend over the bed so she could check if my “hymen was intact”. 
I feel nothing but anger tbh, i normalised that behaviour from her so much that it didn’t bother me after some time, it doesn’t bother me when someone molests me in public either. I think I achieved that level of apathy and indifference by dissociation myself from my body. I consider my body as a vessel i am in, and when someone hurts or violates it, they are violating the vessel and not me personally. I do feel anger though at her and everything she put me through, so ig i feel smth. Can i call these experiences sexual abuse?



Edit: Thanks for everyone’s kind words and thanks to everyone who opened up about similar experiences. I wanted to assure everyone that i am 23 now, last time i was sexually abused by her was a couple months prior to leaving the country at 18. I don’t have to see my family for another year. I wanted to discuss this in therapy but I just couldn’t find the words to describe it ig, I didn’t know what to label it as. Now I know what to call it, i can communicate it better in therapy. 

Sadly, the idea of mental health is very undeveloped in my country and showing any signs of “abnormality” can be dangerous.

Was I raped?,"I'm not sure if this even belongs here, you can delete it if it doesn't. 

about 8 years ago I had a threesome with a married couple who I'd known since we were kids. The deal was he wouldn't be with me but we'd both be with her, which I agreed to. It was a fun night, and afterwards I fell asleep. I woke up some time later with someone spooning me, groping me, and kissing the back of my neck. I tried to push them off, I had no idea who it was or what was happening. When I realized it was the husband I said ""no, please stop"" several times, but he wouldn't listen and kept fighting me. eventually I just gave in. He sodomized me and after he finished made me promise to never tell his wife, Liz. (she had left us alone to go pick someone up at the airport). tbh I never had a lot of self esteem and to say I felt humiliated is an understatement. I didn't want it to happen but I let it happen anyway, i could've protested more maybe if i did it wouldn't of happened. I went home. I was bleeding a lot, one of my roommate noticed and asked me what happened, after a while of her whining I told her and she said ""well that's what you get for whoring around"". 

I accepted what she said, and after that I never told anyone about it, not even my therapists. it's something I try to not dwell over, but when i think about it i feel gross, and sad.

*Edit: I just want to say thank you all for the supportive comments. It means a lot, truly.*

*To the people saying I should tell the wife… it took a lot just to share this with strangers on a subreddit, the guilt and shame are very real.

"I started turning off and locking my phone away every weekend, and it's liberating","This may not apply to everyone. But for me, a person who is severely addicted to instagram and messaging apps, it's just really liberating. I bought this locking device that allows you to lock something in it and set a time for it to reopen (not naming any brand here, everyone please don't make this a post about products). I started out by locking my phone for a few hours, then a whole day, and eventually a whole weekend.

It is surprisingly beneficial to my mental health. I am a hypersensitive type and love to overread and overthink anything anyone say to me. And I also don't have a life. So what happen is that I need to constantly chat with my friends and family, even to the point that may annoy them, and when they show a lil bit of disinterest, even when they are really just busy, I'd literally feel hurt, it sounds so stupid to say such thing as a grown ass person, but yes, and I really hate myself for that.

Once I locked my phone, my brain will immediately try to find substitutes to generate the same stimulation, sometimes I'd use my computer to browse the internet but using the computer just never brings me the same negativity that a phone does, same as how youtube and reddit are somehow just much less toxic than ig and whatsapp to me. I don't play video games and my social circles don't use facebook anymore, so I normally can shut my computer pretty quick because I feel bored again.

And weird enough the next thing I know is that I find myself actually get up from my lazy ass and start doing things like chores, sorting mails and even doing some exercise. I don't think I am anywhere near being mentally healthy, but seriously I am much much better off without that damn phone.

Edit: Sorry guys I can't pm the brand of the device, it's against the rule, you can generally search timed locking box and anything similar will do. There are many boxes that do it.

Edit: The point of this post is really just to put your phone away, and you will instantly feel better once you can detach from the toxicity and focus on yourself.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/mwwo59/i_started_turning_off_and_locking_my_phone_away/,mentalhealth

"If you live in America, Good luck with affording Mental Health Perscriptions","Speaking from my own personal experiences, America doesn't care about your mental health. Do you need a new SSRI that's come out in the past 10 years that helps you a lot? How about you pay over $1,000 for it? Oops, you need that medication to save your life and don't have insurance?

I no longer want to die.,"This time 2 months ago, I was 34 weeks pregnant, with an adoption plan in place to relinquish my baby at birth. After years of suffering heavily with my mental health, I thought I was too fucked up to be able to love a child. No maternal instincts, I couldn’t even look after myself, how the fuck would I look after a baby?

I thought it’d be cruel to subject a child to a lifetime with me. That my baby would be better with someone else, I concealed the pregnancy from my entire family, I’d completely isolated myself from everybody, convinced that I would give birth, give up my baby, and never tell a soul. 

The isolation, spending weeks on end alone in a flat without leaving the house led to a massive decline in my already dire mental health. At 8 months pregnant, an ambulance was called to me at a multi story car park at 3am. I couldn’t do it, not when there was only a few weeks to go, as much as I wanted to die, I figured I’d hang on just 4 more weeks until my baby was born, then I’d do it. 

This led to many services getting involved, social workers, specialist midwives, the crisis team, the home treatment team and even perinatal mental health specialists. I’m not going to go into detail about the home environment I was in, because it still pains me to this day, but it was heavily infested with rats, only one window to the whole place, but because I was heavily pregnant (suffering with carpal tunnel) and could no longer work (I’m self employed, no maternity leave/pay.) I was stuck there, In this dungeon, 8 months pregnant stuck in a dark hell hole I couldn’t go outside due to concealing my pregnancy, listening to rats chewing through the walls around me. I was so ready to die.

Then, my family tried to barge in, convinced that I had fallen into a horrible drug addiction or worse, was rotting away alone, I promised that I would see them the next day and tell them what was happening. They thought this was me being ready to open up, get help, when really it was me giving up. I had nothing left to lose, I planned on being dead soon anyway, and I missed them. During my pregnancy, because of me concealing it i had to miss seeing my mother in hospital after she was rushed in for emergency surgery, my family dog dying (I never got to say goodbye) and, the death of my aunty and her funeral. I figured if I was going to die soon, I wanted to spend my last bit of time with them. I was surrendering, the adoption plan was in place, my baby would have a good life.

My family were supportive, as I knew they would be. Many services presumed my reason for hiding the pregnancy from them was out of fear, but it was the opposite. I’m lucky to come from a loving wealthy family who I didn’t want to change my mind. I wanted to die. 

My family begged me not to go through with the adoption, my mother offering to take full custody of my baby if I tried motherhood and didn’t like it. I wanted them to be happy, I thought he could be my replacement when I was gone, that he’d keep them busy and take some weight off their grief of losing me. I agreed, my mother got me to move back in with her, and I enjoyed the luxuries of sleeping at night not worrying about rats crawling over me and having access to hot water again. 

12 days after I told my family I was pregnant, my beautiful baby boy was born, 3 weeks early. From the second I first held him, he was my boy, and he wasn’t going anywhere.

From the moment he was here, it’s like my mental illness has been an awful boot camp that I’ve finally graduated. Like all my suffering is now worth something. 

As you’ll know, BPD amplified all emotions, I feel everything so intensely my emotions are like a physical sensation. In the past, this has caused me so much pain and heartbreak, until the second I first held my son, and the feeling of maternal love flooded me with the most intense, incredible feeling i could ever imagine. Something I never imagined I could feel, that I thought I was too fucked up to experience, came to me so naturally. And now I have a little human who I can love as much as I want and it doesn’t aggravate him. I’m never ‘too much’ for him, because he needs me and depends on me fully. How can I possibly be suicidal anymore when I have my baby who will always need me?

All those nights I’ve spent awake all hours in tears, seem like preparation for the sleepless nights of having a newborn (,minus the tears!) 

My baby has become my fixation, and the best part? He wants all of my love, he doesn’t want space from me. And I’m never alone anymore. I have somebody to be strong for. Do I still feel like shit sometimes? Absolutely. But I don’t get the chance to feel like shit for too long, cause my baby keeps me busy! My overthinking myself into depressive episodes? Don’t have the time anymore, my boy needs me.

I never imagined being a mother, and I never imagined getting better.. which I’m still not fully. But I’m the best I’ve been in years, and for the first time in a truly long time, I’m no longer suicidal. I want to be here, I want to care for my son, make sure he’s so loved that he’ll never feel unwanted like I have. And with him around, I can’t imagine feeling unwanted for a long time (until he’s old enough for me to be embarrassing!)

It’s like all the love that I’ve had to give finally has a place to go. I’m so happy. I look at him and I just want to do right by him, to be the best mother I can be. 

2 months ago I was 8 months pregnant, isolated from everybody, in a dark rat infested flat, planning on ending my life.

Now, I’m currently led on my big comfy double bed, watching my 6 week old baby sleeping peacefully beside me in his Moses basket, in a nice light clean house, smiling to myself and making plans for our future. 

I always rolled my eyes when people told me it gets better. I’d suffered over a decade of things just getting worse, until this year, I’d finally hit rock bottom. 

Now I’m on top of the world. I’ve never been happier than I have being a mother. It’s been so long since I’ve truly enjoyed being alive. 

This turned into a huge essay, but I don’t like sharing this too much IRL because of the shame and embarrassment of living in such poor conditions, the state my mental health had got to, and also now that he’s here... it breaks my heart to think I ever even considered adoption.

I’ve been heavily and closely monitored by many services, and in the 6 weeks since his birth, I’ve been discharged by 4, and have reduced visits from daily to fortnightly/monthly by all of them. They all tell me how amazing I’m doing at being a mother, and how in their professions it’s so nice to see a happy ending. I feel like I’m finally good enough at something, and that’s being his mummy.

Sorry to go on, I just wanted to share my story and hopefully inspire others that sometimes things do get better. Maybe your turnaround will be nothing like mine, and I’m not at all suggesting having a baby will cure your mental illness, but for me, this is finally me coming out of the other side. 

I’m finally happy. At 22 years old and a decade of diagnosed mental health problems, I don’t want to die anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/dernuk/i_no_longer_want_to_die/,mentalhealth
Why is mental health care so inaccessible?,"Everyone's advice is always, ""talk to a professional"" but nobody will acknowledge how impossible that is. 

I work a full-time job, with benefits. Financially, I'm not rich, but I'm not poor. My insurance supposedly covers mental health services, but I recently made the call for a referral, and I was only given a list of 3 providers. None of them are accepting new patients, and even if they were, I can't find enough info on them online to even know if they will be a good fit for me.

There are a few providers in town that I think I would feel really comfortable with, but they are not covered under my insurance and I cannot afford to pay out of pocket. I make enough that I don't qualify for sliding scale, but not enough to actually pay the full rates.

This is ridiculous to me that, at this point in my life, I am more financially stable than I ever have been and quite frankly, pretty privileged in terms of money. Yet, I cannot get decent mental health care.

Older man (White Male, probably about 60) walks in as I’m already served my food and makes the decision to sit by me with all of the empty spots around.

He seems like a nice enough fellow, but complains about his kids, ex wives, the price of food, politics, and just about everything. 

I make the traditional small talk, just trying to respond as positively as I could to his incessant negativity when out of nowhere I get “You ch-nks never know when to shut the fuck up and it’s starting to piss me off”. I was absolutely taken aback, and knowing that I have a large temper and I’m in a packed restaurant I quickly threw some cash on the table and when the ladies behind the counter asked me where I was going (leaving most of my food” I just said “I’m sorry, I lost my appetite” and walked out as fast as I could.

I didn’t want an assault charge or to cause a scene, but now I can’t sleep at all for the second night and all I hear is his voice. Now I don’t know if I did the right thing. I am not suicidal, but I am having the hardest time with fast thoughts, episodes of uncontrollable rage, and episodes of uncontrollable sadness as I hate that I couldn’t defend myself and I let him prove that I’m a coward. 

I have always been very socially concious and respectful, and I was taught that that was enough. I work hard, 4.0 double major, work charities, try hard. I did everything I can but I can’t bleach my skin or change the way I look. What can I possibly do about this now? I am doing all that I can and it still seems that there’s not a place for me if I can’t get a simple breakfast.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/sxjc6k/yesterday_i_was_called_a_racial_slur_in_a/,mentalhealth
I almost killed myself and it's made me no longer suicidal,"Two nights ago I was on a building with one leg hanging over the edge. I'd called police so that they could find my body and was trying to pull myself over the edge. But I couldn't do it. In that moment, I realised I didn't want to die, just that I'm severely depressed. It's been liberating ever since. I'm no longer mourning for myself or constantly thinking about suicide so I'm feeling a bit better. I've started planning for the future again which is a nice distraction from the way I feel. 

I'm not saying anyone should put themselves in this position to 'test' it or anything, just that no matter how suicidal you feel there's always a part of you that wants to survive because that's our human instinct. Listen to that part. You can do this <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/pzm5gj/i_almost_killed_myself_and_its_made_me_no_longer/,mentalhealth
Men’s Mental Health - I’m here to help,"Hi guys - I’m a 19 year old male who has suffered with severe anxiety, depression, and OCD for over 10 years. I want to end the stigma surrounding men with mental health issues, and help others. 

If there are any men in the group that need a friend, someone to vent to, or anything at all, please message me. I am open to helping anyone, but I feel I’d best be able to help men under 30, just because of my life experiences. For reference, I am located in Virginia, but I’m happy to help anyone anywhere. 

I hope that someone will find this and will have the courage to reach out. My DM’s are a judgement free zone. 

(PS - I am not at all sexist and believe women’s mental health is equally important. I just can relate better to men and what other men may be feeling regarding the stigma.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jqyr25/mens_mental_health_im_here_to_help/,mentalhealth

I am utterly incapable of getting any school work done,"The amount of missing essays, note sheets, coursework, etc that I need to hand in is outstanding. I’ve got so many emails from teachers telling me I need to hand my shit in soon, stuff that was due a month+ ago (that I haven’t even started) 

Idk why I can’t do it. When I actually get far enough to open up my laptop and get the pages that I need, I just end up writing a sentence, staring at my screen for ages, and then giving up. And when I don’t get that far I literally just lay around on my phone pretending it’s not a problem. 

With online lessons as well, it’s so hard to convince myself that it’s not actually optional and I have to go. Usually I either don’t show up, or on rarer occasions I show up and then put it in the background and don’t pay attention at all. 

Idk what’s wrong with me. I’ve been unmotivated like this for a long time but it’s only in recent years that it’s gotten this bad. I used to do homework on the night before/morning of but now I just don’t do it and hope I won’t get told off too badly. 

I’ve tried so many things, pomodoro, reward systems, breaking tasks down into super small bites, focusing on how important school is for my future, short time limits, smaller tasks first, bigger tasks first, etc. I’ve read hundreds of “how to get motivated” articles and the advice never helps. EVERY time I start to work on something I just end up not doing it/thinking “i’ll do it tomorrow” and then not.

Idk what to do, it’s pathetic how incapable I am tbh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/kvoglq/i_am_utterly_incapable_of_getting_any_school_work/,mentalhealth

I Feel Like Myself Again!,"TODAY, I FEEL LIKE MYSELF AGAIN! I don't know how to explain it! I just feel.... right? For the longest time, I have struggled with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks (without therapy/ suffering in somewhat silence and without support). In addition to this, I had an eating disorder (for 6 and a half months) that took over my life, more than depression, anxiety, and panic attacks every could. I ""broke up"" with my eating disorder 5 days ago. I actually wrote out an entire letter to my ED and put it away. In the letter, I discussed why we were ""breaking up"" and why we should NEVER get back together again. It may sound weird, but, I think it worked. Today marks 2 weeks of my ED being gone. I feel energetic again, unapologetic about eating, and powerful. I feel confident. I feel like me again. My depression has lessened and so has my panic attacks. My anxiety is still not better, though, I've been struggling with that for years. I'm sorry if reading this wasted your time, it's just, I feel so happy and freed. I hope you, the reader of this post, has a magnificent, immaculate, and fantastic morning/ day/ afternoon/ evening/ night/ life in general. If you are struggling with any mental disorder, I know it's hard, tough, and just a big ball of horribleness, but I believe in you.

My boyfriend killed himself and now I want to too ,"We were together for 8 years and knew each other for 10. I even hate saying boyfriend because people take our relationship less seriously but our relationship was deep and we were each others person. We never married because we didn’t wanna follow societies rules. I loved that we always had that understanding and at least we always had each other… but now he’s gone… and left me on this god for saken planet to deal with his family and my own life.. which isn’t even much of a life… It’s been about a month in a half. I know it happened. I know… but I’ve been in denial for the most part. I went to his “celebration of life”, I read his note, I saw his death certificate… I’m in very complicated grief… but we were supposed to stick this shitty ass life out together and now he’s gone… how could he do this to me… I’m so hurt and mad and I don’t want to keep living anymore. Im supposed to go to work and act like everything’s okay and keep paying bills and live life for a life not worth living. The only thing I’m living for is my mom but that’s honestly kind of dark. It’s like I’m hoping she passes soon so I can leave this miserable life. Some days I don’t even know if I’m strong enough to wait for her. I’m tired of being in pain. Just living. Anytime I go out and “ live life” I hate it and it just reminds me of why I should’ve never been born. Living just to not to upset others at this point.

I have always been under the impression nobody notices me…,"Today I was sat next to a person with really cute hair and I kind of wanted to compliment them but they had ear plugs in so I didn’t know if I could.

Well… when they were about to get off the bus, they handed me a note they had written on their bus ticket. I was honestly confused and intrigued.

I look at the note and it essentially reads that they think I seem cool and if I’d like a friend I can message them (and gave me their details of sorts).

Honestly, I would’ve never seen this coming from a million miles away and I feel so ecstatic and joyful that someone noticed me? I was under the impression that I’m a ‘nobody’ that no one ever pays attention to, but clearly that’s not true. I don’t know whether to cry or run around in happiness… all I know is I’m really, really happy!!

My parents were having sex next to me and it fucked me up,"Hi guys. Just wanted to vent a bit about some of my childhood traumatic experieces.
When I was a child my parents had been having sex next to me in the same bed. My first memories are from around when I was 5 years old. They were doing it thinking I was asleep but I was too scared to tell them I am not and that I see and understand everything. I started then to make some noises during their sex so they could feel uncomfortable and they stopped doing it since I was about 7 because they moved me into my own room.
The thing is that it made me sexual way too young. I had my first sex with my female best friend when I was 8. I literally was repeating what I saw and I actually even experienced pleasure. She didn't even probably knew what I was doing. When her mother found out she was mad af. I remember my friend came to me and said we are not allowed to spend time together in her room anymore. After a while I started touching myself and putting some toys inside to feel pleasure. I was just 8 years old...
I feel so fucked up in my brain from all of this. I feel horrible for what I did. I feel gross about myself, I feel as a pervert and rapist. I hate myself for being so sexual. I had a very messy sexual life afterwards with a lot of partners and I was even cheating because sex was my weakness. I am ashamed of myself. I stopped having sex now because I feel like a perv. I don't know how to overcome this trauma and what can help. Did anyone else go through something similar? Please shine some light on this if you did. Thank you.

Update: Thank you all for such a support. I feel much better after reading your comments about the fact I was just a child and is not my fault I wasn't taught about sex and what's right and what's not. I also want to mention that I am a female and already an adult, it was more than 20 years ago but I kept this within myself for a long time because of shame and guilt I felt. Thank you for this opportunity to open up and be heard. You are great community 🩷",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/16d48fi/my_parents_were_having_sex_next_to_me_and_it/,mentalhealth
"I don't want to turn into a violent, angry, incel [M 21]","Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I saw the recent documentary on incels by the BBC, and it was just me staring at what I've become.

&#x200B;

I'm socially maladjusted due to my upbringing, my parents didn't allow me to interact with other kids, so my social skills dwindled ever since. I have a lot of social anxiety, and can barely look people in the eyes. My posture is stiff, I can't smile, I'm paranoid that everyone hates me.

&#x200B;

Because of this, I tried to find a community of others that felt similar to me. I dwelled within incel forums for the past 2-3 years, but I don't want to live this way. I see people on there talking about the most fucked up shit, and I sometimes smiled about it. I don't want to be this way.

&#x200B;

I want help but I don't know what to do. How do I become socially successful and beat social anxiety? I want to be accepted by others, not become a sick person.

Is it even possible for me? I don't have any friends, social-skills, or people to support me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/cddceh/i_dont_want_to_turn_into_a_violent_angry_incel_m/,mentalhealth
Getting a cat helped my mental health,"I was going through a really rough time as far as my mental health goes. My therapist wasn't the right one for me, so I quit going and was really not feeling so great and was in a pretty dark place.

Then after a while he decided he could trust us and have been amazing. He sleeps in my bed every night and loves to talk to me. It's really nice having him there when my roommate isn't home. His presence makes me feel a little less alone. I still struggle with it, but he's made it a little easier cause I have this cute little guy that's always happy to see me.

I'm a 40+ year old man with two young boys and a wife. I need to brain dump.,"Firstly, I just need this out of my head. I am not posting for attention or answers. I just need to get this all out without effecting someone else with my worries or just downright dumb thoughts.

I've been messing up again. Not knowing what's going on with schools and if they will close them again or if they will just keep going until kids start dropping. I don't know if I'm really worried if I've been made to feel that way. I don't know because the people in power are less honest than my 6 year old.

He's six. He was just 1. My other is 4. But he was just born it feels like. I'm 41. AND MY KIDS ARE 6 AND 4. How much longer do I have where I will be mentally fit to care for them? Or will I just be the old ass cranky dad who forgot what it's like to feel the magic of being a child? I haven't yet but one day I will. Will I make a big enough impact in my sons lives then when I die they will miss me? Will they talk about me with pride? Or will it be all the ways I failed...I'm so scared to screw up being a father that it is crippling.

My father wasn't a father. He was there. He didn't beat me or hurt me or scream at me. For that he would have had to actually care I was alive. I haven't spoke to him in years and I don't see that ever changing. My mom. My mother. The most racist, horrible, mean, scorned and damaged person I have ever met. I love her but I don't ever want to see them again.

I'm white. My wife is black. We have two mixed boys. The world is so messed up. Will my boys be treated different? Will they be looked down on? Will they not get chances because of it? Or will someone hand them something just because they are mixed? Why in the hell do I worry about this? Will they get killed at school? Will I be able to save them if they are in danger?

How do I cook a fucking hamburger on the stove without it turning to shit? I can't even fix the damn toilet that keeps clogging because I was never shown how to be a man and I know the world is different and It might not be right but It feels that way. I have nothing to be proud of. What my kids and wife? How in the hell has she not left me yet? I'm the most annoying person you could meet. I started puking again. I can't handle this. I used to be skinny and fast and strong. Now my knees hurt. The other day I hurt my neck from STANDING UP? It hurt for three days. I feel like there is nothing useful in me anymore. I'm 41 and anything that mattered is gone. Now I only have jobs. I have a job to raise my children to be great humans who don't hate. I have to teach my wife how to prepare for when I die. I have to make sure everyone is okay and taken care of. So when I die they are okay.

So what about while I'm alive? I get that I don't matter in the long run. My children do. But I am sick of being here. On Earth. I'm scared. I'm mentally alone. I make myself feel this way and I don't know why. I just want a life I can't have. I try to make things like they were...like all the horrid holidays when I was a child I try to make so beyond special for my kids that I've spoiled them and now nothing means anything.

I just want to feel like I'm wanted again. Not needed. I wish I had a friend. But I'm terrified of people. I can't even order at a drive thru without going into a minor panic attack and ordering too much. I'm starting to mentally crack at the smallest things. I don't yell or scream. I go sit in the garage and cry. So no one knows it. So when someone askes me why I'm sad and I explain it, they can't follow up with ""well what you need to do is"" ""or you shouldn't feel"". No shit. I'm not doing it for attention and I didn't say it was rational but I'm a grown ass man and I should not feel like this. I should not feel like I only matter because of ""responsibilities"". I just want someone to have a better day just because I am in their life. Why is it so wrong to want to feel good about something? To be noticed. For something besides ""can I have a snack"". Or because 99% of every decision that has to be made has to be made by me or it doesn't get made. I'm stretched too thin. I'm not superman. I can't do it all. I can't always make a decision. I'm human. And right now, I'm scared. And I'm not dealing with it okay. I knew that when I started to puke after I eat. There is this spot in the back and side of my mouth that if I tap with a straw I can empty my stomach in 10 seconds. So now I eat once a day. And I notice that my belly stays now. My whole life I could never gain a pound. 140 was the most I ever got. Then I was 160. And my stomach was gone. Now it was bigger. I was short of breath. My hair is gray in spots. I'm getting older. I'm already old. And one day I'll die. And idk what that is either. But I know that it doesn't matter what good I do, what will matter the most is what I wasn't able to do. The areas where I failed. Because no one is perfect. So I am going to fail. And that is the one thing I cannot afford to do.

I'm not asking for a pity party. I'm not asking for a damn thing. I just needed this out. But I will say that being a man makes this harder. Men are treated different when they talk about mental health. If I could just man up I would. And I do. Every damn day I man up. I do my job. I take care of my family and I'm damn good at it. But sometimes, it all comes in at me. Sometimes I get a chance to sit and think. And that is scary. I live my life on autopilot. When I stop to think is when it's bad.

I don't know any of you but I hope you are all happy. We live in an age where it's almost comical for people say they just want to be happy. But it's not. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be loved. Or wanted to be noticed.

&#x200B;

My guinea pig died and no one cares,"My guinea pigs (Täpi and Triibu, Täpi died in 2016. They were brothers so Triibu has been alone for 4 years) have been my only friends for 7 years now.

 Täpi had a tumour and died at 3 years old. My mum was the only one to even acknowledge that I had the right to be sad but others were literally saying ""it's just a guinea pig, it's not like a dog or anything so it doesn't matter"".

I was really depressed after that and since he died in his sleep I got this habit where I have to check every 10 minutes if Triibu is moving. Their cage is in my room.

2 days ago I wole up in the morning and went to check on him but he wasn't moving. I rattled the cage cause even if he's sleeping he usually reacts to that.

He didn't.

I went downstairs and told my mum. I went outside. In a few minutes she came back and said he wasn't dead yet bus close to it and that I should go be with him. When I got there he was dead.

I couldn't even say goodbye.

And I had to dig the grave and bury him while everyone else was laughing and just chilling in the garden.

 And I can't sleep. And I'm sad. It's too quiet in my room, and all the noises are wrong.

Today my mum's been yelling at me all day to clean the cage and take it out of my room but I can't even go near it without crying.

War in my country ,"My country, Lebanon, has been been at war with Israel for the past 6 months and the situation is getting worse and so is my mental health. They’ve been targeting innocent civilians and killing children. Every day, we hear the air strike or the sound barrier broken (they do this so they could make people panic) at the most random times. I genuinely can’t take this anymore. Every time I hear a loud sound, I have a panic attack and mental breakdown. Just a few hours ago, we heard a loud sound and I broke into tears. I don’t know how to cope or manage my emotions. I’ve been trying to distract myself but my body’s in constant stress and anxiety.  I already have anxiety and this situation is worsening mine.

I watched someone mourn my own death today.,"My friend took something without me knowing. They forgot what day it was, he hallucinated that a man stabbed me, that I died. 
I held his hand and said “I’m alive, I’m safe. you’re safe” it said they were imagining me. 
“I’m real.” I said.
They started crying; “You’re not.”

Hey so this is an edit: I just want to clear some things up, my friend was not OD’ing on oxy. I would have known, and I would have obviously done something about it. My friend experiences hallucinations in everyday life even when sober, the drugs they were on just amplified them. I sat with them for about an hour after this happened, they mostly came down from the high. I couldn’t have prevented their parents from coming, and I know the safest place anyway is with his parents, who are adults, I am not. I may delete this post at some point, I didn’t anticipate having to give out so much of his personal information.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/rpfk2g/i_watched_someone_mourn_my_own_death_today/,mentalhealth

I am a broken man both mentally and physically. So I jumped on a bike and started pedalling across the country. I'm not stopping until I hit the other side.,"Hi everyone, 

About a month ago I started to think about Cycling across country, two weeks later I left Moncton NB at 1pm in the afternoon and haven't looked back, tomorrow I will cross into Quebec. 

I think this is interesting for a few reasons. 

1- As I said, I am fat and out of shape. I am 44m 6'5 320lbs and have not exercised in any meaningful way in 20 years. I have bad knees, bad back, apnea and I'm type 2 diabetic. 

2- Mentally, I'm broken. I suffer from really bad depression, bipolar 2 and Chemicaly Induced Anxiety Disorder. 

3- I was raised as a ward of the court, 30+ foster homes, street kid, jail, addiction. Been a hard road. 



So why on earth am I doing this? Two main reasons. First and foremost BC is my home province, they recently passed into law funding for school for former wards of the court regardless of age. I plan on taking full advantage of this and I think this should be the standard across all provinces. I have stagnated in the same industry for years and have hit a ceiling. If I ever want to retire and leave something behind for my girls I need something more. And education is where I'll start. 


Secondly, if I am to be successful with my schooling I need to get my head in order. Because of my CIAD I can't take antidepressants, so all my mental health issues I tackle on my own. And frankly depression is winning. I could fly out to BC and be there 12hrs from now, but I will end up being the same man. 

However, the man that can jump on a bike and pedal his ass all the way to Vancouver Island, that man can do anything. He can regain control of his mental health, he can regain his physical health and he can dedicate a healthy body and mind to his schooling. 

So I want to try and bring some awareness to the mental health struggles and the ward of the court funding thing. 


It's been over two weeks since I've left and there's been some hard dark moments, but there's been some empowering ones too. I'm already down about 20lbs, there's strength in my legs and back ive not felt since I was a teenager, I'm about to cross into a new province and I thought it was worth sharing with this community. 

I have already been posting in another subreddit since I started and they've all been so amazing. 

I have been posting almost daily updates to my insta and tiktok but if I understand correctly I can't link them here on this subreddit? I also have a blog I've been writing when I have time. 

Both the blog and videos are not a magical Xmas land type of upbeat energetic thing. I talk about and show both the ups and downs of mental health and this monumental challenge I've taken on. 


I hope there's a few of you who might pass me on your drives, don't hesitate giving me a honk or a wave. I'll be the big fat guy on a mountain bike :)

"My Mom passed in September, today a neighbor asked my Dad on a date. Am I a jerk to be upset/hurt about her asking him out when it’s still such a fresh pain for our family?","My Mom passed September 25, 2021.
My parents had been married since 1979 when mom was 18 and dad was 22.
They have 4 sons ages 41, 40, 39, and 37 and then they have me a 17 yr old daughter. 

Today a neighbor stopped by to drop cookies off to my Dad and asked him out on a dinner date. Dad looked right at me and then told her “I’m gonna have to get back to you on that one” 

Backstory on the neighbor: about a month after her husband died (like in 2016ish) she asked my Dad to come home with her one night from a bar party a bunch of the neighbors were at. Since then my Mom wasn’t a huge fan of the neighbor since she tried to convince my Dad to go home with her, and my Dad has avoided this woman like the plague because he wasn’t interested in anyone but my Mom and didn’t want to be asked again. I’ve personally witnessed my Dad jog from his truck to the house so he wouldn’t run into the neighbor and have to talk to her.

My parents were that couple that were still so obviously in love after so many years that anyone around them could see how they felt about one another. 

I obviously want my Dad to be happy and I would never stop him from seeing someone, but am I wrong to not feel quite ready yet to see my Dad with another women 3 months after my Mom passed?

Is it possible he was subtly telling her no without making a scene/awkward?

Am I being childish for being a little stressed about it since it’s only been 3 months and Dad and I are both still having more bad days than good ones?",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/rpqh8j/my_mom_passed_in_september_today_a_neighbor_asked/,mentalhealth

The system in American is directly related to the current mental health crisis sweeping the nation.,Does being unproductive make you feel worthless? Does the anxiety of paying for college only to work a job you have no passion for set you over the edge? We are basically paying our lives away to survive. We go to school to get a degree only to work a job to pay bills. I understand that are other routes to take but for a majority of people this is unrealistic. Not everyone has the capital to be an entrepreneur. Not everyone has the time to sit down and develop their skills. In American we are slaves to the system until we die. We work until we are full. We pay bills until we are poor. We are deprived of happiness through means labor to gain profit for people in power. Humans were not meant to work 40+ hours of week to have two days of freedom during the week. We are worth more than what we are able to produce to society.,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/k46evd/the_system_in_american_is_directly_related_to_the/,mentalhealth
"""Its because I love you, dumbass.""","I was beating myself up. I asked him why after all the shit he stayed. After the ups and downs, the lies and trauma, after everything, why he stayed with me.
He said it was obvious why and I couldn't see it. Not a mile a way... it was his response. 
This response wasn't out of anger or annoyance, and for once I heard something in his voice that rang a certain sincerity.
We've been through a lot and there are bad bad days like today were he will sit and listen while I panic, and help me wade through the paranoia and negative self talk. This week has been hard as I'm coming off my meds because of the shutdowns, so I'm physically withdrawing from the lack of Seratonin and other things. All I have been hearing from him is support. I've been a mess. He knows when it's bad I shut down and not think or rather think to much. 
I'm so afraid he will leave, and yet he stays. Even through my delusions of utter saddness.
There is so much wrong in the world, and yet one of my biggest fears, is losing him. Hes not perfect, but I'm glad hes my best freind.

I hate my boobs,"The title says it all. I thought I’d eventually get over this, but it’s really been taking a toll on me. For reference, I’m a 34B.
It’s reached the point where I can’t go out without an extremely padded push-up bra. 
But when I get home and take it off, I’m hit with the harsh reality of how I actually look. It’s like a constant reminder that no matter how much I try to boost my appearance, it’s just not the same.

I feel less like a woman and genuinely believe that no one will ever love me because of how I look. What hurts the most is knowing that the only way to change this might be through a cosmetic procedure, but those are very expensive, and I don’t have the funds for that.

I’ve tried everything—gaining weight (which is tough due to my fast metabolism) and supplements—but nothing seems to make a difference. I feel like I don’t deserve to be taken seriously by men, and while I know people say life isn’t all about men (and I wholeheartedly agree) I still want them to find me attractive because they’re my preferred gender, but I feel like I will never achieve that because of the way my body is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1ekeu6v/i_hate_my_boobs/,mentalhealth

Yes, they are part of us but they do not define us. Still, we let it define us because it feels so comfortable, therefore the real challenge is to find yourself outside of this sadness.

i'm so tired of being told I'm overreacting whenever I get emotional,"I (23F) was diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder a year or so ago, and it has made a lot of things make a lot of sense. I have very low self-esteem and frequently deal with thoughts of not being good enough and feeling like people wouldn't miss me if I wasn't here. When people give me reasons to believe those thoughts, it fucks me up.

When my mom didn't call me on my birthday, I spent the whole day depressed because I thought she didn't care enough to remember.

When my family dog had to be put down suddenly, I was the last one to be told, and had it not been for my brother convincing my dad to call me, I wouldn't have known until the next morning, when she would've already been dead for hours. 

My dad got a new dog yesterday, which I again wasn't told until everyone else had known for a while. He didn't even tell me, my brother accidentally let it slip after they'd been to see it and was asked if they wanted to take her home with them for a few hours as a trial run. 

To anyone else, these would be things easily shrugged off, but they really get to me. Family is supposed to be the people who will want to be around you no matter what, yet I feel they try to avoid me and it sucks. On top of that, when I get emotional over these things, I get told I need to get my shit together and stop being to overdramatic. 

I talked to my brother about the dog-incident, and he told me to stop being so dramatic, and that this wasn't a big deal. To him it wasn't, to me it is. This argument has me in fucking tears cause I'm a mess.

My whole life I've been told my feelings are too much. I was the quiet, shy kid, and was never the one to get attention. However, when I was bullied at school and at home, and developed anxiety, I tried my best to get attention the only way I knew how, pretending to be sick. After the teachers caught on that I was faking, they eventually stopped caring, and let me walk around the school yard crying. It took me so long to realize I was crying because I was extremely anxious and was begging for help. 

Now, having been told my entire life that I'm just overreacting, that's also how I speak to myself. I'll have a literal panic attack, and the only thought in my head is that I'm faking. I still don't actually believe my panic attacks are real, even though the symptoms match up perfectly, but my brain will never give me the benefit of the doubt.

I'm sorry for the long rant. Even posting this I'm expecting people to tell me I just need to get my shit together. I hate hating myself so much",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/w7q860/im_so_tired_of_being_told_im_overreacting/,mentalhealth

Does anyone feel frustrated being surrounded by people who don't recognize mental health is just as important as physical health?,"I (unfortunately, imo) come from a country where mental health is usually overlooked, if not completely ignored. Therapy is not available and people would say I'm making excuses for being lazy/stupid if I tell them about my mental health issues. Since I was a kid, I've always been someone who is emotional, easily triggered, easily stressed out, and tends to overthink. Everyone, even my parents, sees me as ""weak, oversensitive, and dramatic"". They don't believe one can be struggling mentally when they look just fine and ""normal"" physically. There were some critical points in my life when I got panic attacks and cried everyday, I couldn't eat or sleep and was losing weight but my parents were totally helpless (and clueless) because I didn't seem to be sick anywhere looking from the outside.

I don't blame my parents for neglecting my mental health though. They live in such conservative society and had a hard time making ends meet, so I doubt they even have time to learn about something so foreign to them. I blame the whole ""cultural stigma"" in general. I feel like a misfit.

I had been dealing with it since my father passed away 4 years ago. 
Last year was a really rough for me, I was unable to go outside, going to the university even to clean myself, Everything was making scared I felt like it was no future for me. My notes were going down close to getting kick out of the university, lots of debts, No money incomes, sent tons of job applications and no answer, losing friends, weight,started with suicidal thoughs and close to getting suicidal tendencies, was hitting the bottom until I met my gf (current ex) a wonferful woman that helped me go through and push me over to see a specialist because I wanted to be better for me and for her. We are no longer together but thanks to her I am better now, I don't know what could happened if I didn't meet her, I will be forever thankful to her. 

Took me a year to seen my potential and what I was capable, Also to love myself again. Was a difficult journey I will not lie but trust me, it is really worthy.

Being addicted to daydreaming (Maladaptive daydreaming),"hey um.. I recently found out about this ""disorder"" (i put it in quotes because it is not actually recognized by the DSM)

It is when people daydream very extensively for sometimes hours a day. They create their own highly structured universes and scenarios that help them cope with drama etc.

They often have the urge to that as soon as they wake up. Also while doing that a lot of people engage on repetitive movement (like pacing around). I have heard that psychologists suspect that it activates certain areas in the brain that control your imagination or might effect it in a hypnotic way (((excuse my wording i am not a native speaker lol)))

Those people do NOT gaslight themself. In fact most of MDers are able to tell which of their memories are within their paracosm/imagination and which are not.

Effects of this intense daydreaming is that people with that ""disorder"" sometimes find it very hard to focus on ANYTHING.

Some people argue that daydreaming is natural and MD should not be regarded as a mental illness. I think it certainly has characteristics of a mental illness. It is a coping mechanism at the beginning but at some point MDers find themself daydreaming all day because they got so used to living in this paracosm that they don´t enjoy reality as much anymore. And this is an endless circle. Because if you don´t do stuff with other people or your friends, and avoid your responsibilities and flee in your paracosm your live will get more miserable and your imagined friends, scenarios and word will look more and more appealing.

I recently found out that i might have this ""disorder"". I have stumbled across this because I had problems with not being able to live in the present. A lot of my scenarios are about my future and they are often highly fantastical. So instead of actually doing stuff that might bring me to a future that i might enjoy i just dream about already being there.

Since then i am always searching for new information on this subject and one researcher that does amazing work within this field is Eli Somer. He was the first one who recognized it and publishes a lot of videos about MD on youtube.

Here is his channel: [https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic](https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic)

If you have any thoughts, or further research sources please drop them here. And especially if you have experience with this subject first hand.

I just want people to know that this is real and effects people.

Even if nobody reads this..,"writing is a form of therapy that releases the pressure in my heart and brain and allows me to cope. It helps me make sense of and mop up the gray matter. I have felt pain, I have felt joy, I have felt grief, and I have feared for my life but nothing matches the nameless emotion waging war on me. For those who don’t personally know me, I am making a drastic move for the betterment of myself and my family financially and this is the battle I’m facing inside. I’ve felt so absent from myself and completely empty. Watching my house go from years of being the safe place for sailors, laughter, gatherings, hot meals, and an ear, to thin bare walls and empty rooms broke me in ways I never thought possible. People I’ve loved have weaved in and out of those rooms without thought in search of a place to call home, and here I am staring at the worn paint and marks along the walls from memories of beer pong, twister, and indoor dodgeball amongst other absurd things, wondering where the time went and if I’ll ever feel family like I have over the several years I’ve built and nurtured my circle. I don’t believe for a single moment that I wasn’t meant to experience the connections and the love that I’ve felt here, but with that comes the inevitable goodbyes. The halting end of a time that saved my life. Nothing teaches you how to introduce yourself and part ways all in the same breath quite like the Navy, but it never gets easier. No more dinners with friends gathering around the table to feel a sense of family where our respective families are absent. No more beer pong nights with 90’s hits, or spontaneous card game nights. My world has fallen silent. Laughter became tears, joy became pain, and I don’t know what to do with the things that I feel.

Schizophrenia is very stigmatized,"I was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and this disorder is very stigmatized. People think we are going to kill people or obey the voices we hear. It’s all 100% not true. There are some schizophrenics who never killed people. John Nash, the mathematician. Brian Wilson, the singer-songwriter of The Beach Boys, Daniel Johnston. a singer-songwriter. We aren’t harmful, some of us are just scared. We don’t kill nor plan to kill you. We get paranoid but we try to heal it before it gets worse. To me depression can be just as bad as schizophrenia. Any mental disorder really can be just as bad as any disorder.

Food, shelter, peace are all simple things that everybody should have but many people fight hard to get. That definitely plays a huge role is people who have depression, anxiety, stress, guilt and those types of things could snowball into more serious issues.

If everyone on Reddit is American then that means our experiences from a developing country don't matter?,"I recently asked on the teaching subreddit to share some teaching advice for a kid of our family friend who is acting uncontrollably cranky. A responder started berating me for not taking the kid to therapy. I explained to them that I live in a South Asian country so accessing and affording therapy for us is extremely difficult. I'm struggling a lot with mental health. They started blaming me for not adding a disclaimer that I'm south Asian in the main post, it's not their fault for being mean to me, the majority of the users are Americans, if I need advice then I better add this in the disclaimer.
I understand that most Reddit users are American but I thought teacher-student connection is universal irrespective of nationality. I don't understand why can't people put aside their nationality. I have had great insightful conversations with lots of people on Reddit, but I occasionally receive judgemental opinions like this. Why can't people open up to others experiences, if not then at least try to be compassionate? It sometimes does make me feel that no matter what we do, people from developing countries will always be considered stupid and unwanted.

Edit- thank you so much for such heartwarming and encouraging responses. I wish to clarify that I still have equal respect for Americans as I do for every other being regardless of their background.

"You are more than the things that are ""wrong"" with you","For whoever needs to hear this today:

You are VALID and you are VALUABLE! Do not let yourself be defined by your diagnosis. You are more than just a collection of the things that are ""wrong"" with you. You are a person, and you are who you are in spite of these things, not because of them. Never let anyone belittle you because of your struggles. You are STRONGER than the people who ""grit their teeth and bear it"" because they have not had to jump the same hurdles as you to get where you are. 

It is NEVER shameful or weak to ask for help. Anyone who tells you otherwise has forgotten that they once had to be spoon fed as a child or has forgotten how many times they've had to ask their grandchildren to fix their computer. 

Stay the path. It may be long, it may come with unexpected turns, but eventually there is light at the end.

"To anyone who was hurt, abused, manipulated or ridiculed by parents/caregivers: it's not your fault and it's not your job to fix them and their shitty problems.","I have come to fully understand something, at 25 years of age - it's not your fault how adults treated you when you were a kid. You literally had not a single ounce of control over their stupidity, selfishness and incapability.

If you were abused, hurt, ripped apart by their words or even physically injured by those so-called grown-ups in your childhood, **it is absolutely and categorically not your fault**. And it is not your job to fix it. It's not your job now and it wasn't your job then. You had no control over their actions and no responsibility for them. They had the responsibility to care for you and they messed it up big time. You did not ask to be born into the situation you were born into. You were a vulnerable child whose needs, for some reason or another, were not fully met. And that rests entirely with the adults, not with you. A child can never be blamed for that. And the child who turns into the adult should not blame themselves for their parents' shortcomings, either.

Also, **you owe them nothing**. They may have fed you and put a roof over your head, but if they otherwise treated you like shit, or still do treat you like shit, walk away and don't look back. Now you're an adult and you have choices and autonomy over your own life. You don't need to be around them if you don't want to, or if it doesn't feel safe and secure.

I am so sorry that this happened to you and, believe me, I understand. Parents are not all as brilliant and kind as they're supposed to be. Some of them are assholes.

Can someone be proud of me,"I made my way out of deep suicidal depression many months ago and have ever since been trying to get on top of things.

Despite my efforts I’m failing multiple classes at the fault of my teachers unable to cope with online learning resources. My parents believe I’m just slacking off when really I am working until the early hours of the morning everyday.

All of the pressure from school and my parents are blinding me from recognizing that I’m trying my absolute best and that the things that bother me the most right now are not my fault.

After all, I beat my depression, I’ve made new friends, I got my license recently, and summer is right around the corner even if I have to do summer school at the rate things are going.

Ultimately, I just want to hear from somebody that they’re proud of me. I don’t get to hear it from the people I wish would say it, but I know people know my struggle right now and have struggled far more than me and it means a lot to hear it from people that understand.

"My girlfriend died several years back, and I met someone else now for the first time, but I’m struggling with this a lot.","I’m 28 now and my old girlfriend of five years died soon after we graduated college. 

I loved that girl more with all my heart. We’d been together since high school and all throughout college. She was diagnosed with cancer a few months after we graduated and died approximately six months later. It was obviously very painful for everybody involved, but she and I made our peace. 

After that, I completely focused myself in my career, and I’ve seen a lot of success in it. I’m in a very good place right now professionally. To get through this, I refused to even look at any girl I found even remotely attractive for like three years. I just didn’t want to feel anything that would remind me of her. Regrettably, I think it’s made me somewhat of a cold hearted person, but it was just like the light of my life was destroyed. 

About a year ago, I met this one girl through a mutual friend, and something about her and I just kind of clicked. I’ve been official for about four months now, and I really like her; however, ever since I started to become close to her, I’ve been having these sort of panic attacks where I just can’t stop thinking about my old girlfriend. I repressed these emotions for so long it’s all flooding back to me at once and I can’t handle it. I haven’t told this new girl for obvious reasons, but I think she’s beginning to suspect that something’s up. 

I feel like I’m desecrating the bond my old girlfriend and I had by being in a new relationship. She was the girl I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. I don’t know what to do now. I just don’t. Things like this just make we wish I could be at work 24/7. Work has no emotion. It’s such a safe place for me mentally. Sure, it’s an incredibly stressful and high hours job, but work related stress keeps my mind off those other thoughts.

"Oh dear guys! I am SO shocked, surprised, and even happy (-ish)!!!","Slight TW: SH mentioned: NO details though!  


  
Our 18 year old son just came out to me! I was asking him if there are any girls that he is interested in (or thinks is cute) in his CTC classes or his other classes, and he said, ""mmmm...maybe I am not interested in girls"" to which I had said...""ok how about boys?"" He answered ""Mmmm...mayyyyyyybe!""

OMG I am so happy that he feels confident and trusts me enough to tell me that! I told him I don't care who he loves, as long as he is happy. :) Our eldest daughter (the one graduating from college in a few weeks) is in a lesbian relationship, and I remember when she had come out to me at age 17. I said the same thing to her, and we have always been welcoming of anyone she dates.

&#x200B;

I am so proud of our daughter and son. :) Now for the 17 year old...I think he is still aromantic. He doesn't seem to be interested in anyone dating-wise. All 3 of our boys are on the Spectrum and have depression and anxiety, so I have never pushed them to ""find someone"". :) Our eldest has always been more academic than boy-crazy (or girl-crazy in her case), and I just want them to be happy--WHATEVER they end up doing...dating or not dating. :)

My whole world just collapsed.,"My fiancé walked out on me last night out of nowhere. We’ve always had an amazing, strong relationship, or so I thought. I was putting dinner on his plate, a normal evening, until he mentioned he didn’t want much because his stomachs been upset and he can’t eat. When I asked why... that’s when my world ended. We have been together for 11 years, engaged for only 4 months. For the last 5 years, I’ve been living with terminal cancer and he’s been my rock. My mental health has been very touchy as one can imagine having incurable cancer and he’s been the one thing keeping me here and fighting. I actually did a clinical trial that surprisingly helped me. We’re just getting to a place with my health where maybe I can live a “normal” life. We’re supposed to be leaving on vacation in a few weeks and finally got to a point where we can plan things for the future. Theres so much coming up. I’ve been improving myself and my mental health A LOT. He says he sees these improvements and they should make him happy, but it doesn’t. He told me when I just had my scans, he should’ve felt something, but he didn’t. He’s lost his compassion for me and isn’t in love with me anymore. I supported him through school and now that he’s done, he’s not only my emotional, but my financial rock, as well as helping me with things my disability makes hard. I don’t have much family and I lost a lot of people when I was diagnosed with cancer. He threw in my face that he wants children and I can’t provide that (this isn’t anything new) and when I said I was getting to a point in my health where I could start looking into options for how to have kids he said, “even if we could, is it smart to bring a child into this world not knowing if they’ll have a mom around?” Not being able to have kids has been one of the hardest things that i struggle with, and he knows that and always reassured me that I was more important. I didn’t even know this person talking to me. So cold, empty. I feel so hurt because many times at the beginning of my diagnosis, I told him to leave me so that I didn’t have to drag him into this life and he always promised me he wouldn’t have it any other way. He told me he’s not happy with his life and his priorities have changed and he doesn’t want to resent me. We never even argued. We were the couple people looked up to and my life collapsed around me in a matter of seconds. I’m having to tell people today and they’re not even believing it. Everything was perfect and then everything was gone. I don’t know how to live without him. I don’t even know how I can make this work. I’m so hurt and angry. Why propose mere months ago after 10 years just for this to happen? How can you just leave as things were getting okay and after I had everything in my life already ripped away with cancer and was trying to figure out how to rebuild and finally have a “normal” life? I haven’t slept, I can’t eat. I’m scared of what I might do when reality sets in. I’m going to die alone. Nobody wants to be with the amputee with cancer and I’m devastated. My self esteem has never been lower. I can’t have kids. I’m going to die alone. And a part of me wishes my cancer was bad again and it would take me sooner so I don’t have to do this anymore. I’m so over these cards I’ve been dealt. I had a 20% chance of still being alive in March, and he won’t be there by my side. I don’t know what to do and I’m afraid I’ll never be okay again.

A Lush Employee bought me a bathbomb today and it may have saved my life.,"I hit rock bottom a couple years ago and lost everything due to clinical burnout, mental illness, trauma, and multiple deaths in my immediate family. I had no income because everyday I was struggling to keep myself alive and couldn’t work, so my bills stacked up quick from only being able to make minimum payments; and sometimes having to delay payments so I could eat. 

This year has been a huge turning point for me and I was able to get a job that I love, but it’s only part time and I had to do a slow-return to prevent burnout. I’ve been slowly paying back my bills, but I guess someone got fed up with me and the bank ended up taking all my money for this month. I found out in Lush when I tried to buy a single bathbomb for my aching muscles after long retail hours. 

My card declined. I played it off and left the store in a panic trying to figure out why I didn’t have five dollars, and I saw that the bank drained my account. My face must have given me away, because the cashier ran out of the store with the bathbomb I’d failed to purchase and just put his hand on my shoulder and told me it was ok. I almost didn’t take it, I was so shocked, and asked if he was sure, and he said “it’s just a bathbomb”. 

I got into my car and started to sob, not knowing how I am going to eat and pay the rest of my bills this month, and I had moments where I wanted to drive somewhere and not return - but my mind kept coming back to this person who showed me such kindness and generosity, a stranger, and they in no way were required to help me. 

I’m still emotional over it; and I plan on thanking him when I get the bandwidth to do so. Let this be a message to show people small kindnesses when you can, because you may well be saving a life and giving hope.

Found out my daughter is cutting herself,"I (32F) just found out my (13F) daughter is cutting herself. She said it’s been going on for a little more than a week. Her brother was the one who told me.

She showed me them and they are superficial and don’t need immediate medical attention.

I tried to remain calm and just not overreact or panic. I let her know that I’m sorry she was feeling so strongly that she resorted to hurting herself and I let her know that I don’t think badly of her and I want to help her.

She agreed that she would like to get help so we are going to get a referral from her doctor for a therapist on Wednesday.

She said she does it to relieve stress and when she’s feeling upset but that it isn’t a suicide attempt. I let her know that we need to find another way for her to release stress since this is dangerous.
I took her with me to work and school today so we could spend some extra time together. 

I’m not sure what else I can do. I’m trying to keep it together but I do feel terrible that she is feeling so low. I wish I could take all her pain away.

Edit: *Update*
Thanks for all the support! Even though I tried my hardest to do what was best it still felt like I wasn’t doing enough so it was very reassuring reading through everyone’s comments and experiences. 

We got a referral from her pediatrician so now we are waiting for therapy. In the mean time we have been doing more activities together and she has been a lot more open to trying stuff. 

Yesterday was rough because I spent some one-on-one time with my son (9) and she felt a little betrayed after we were spending so much time together. At first she didn’t want to talk to me but eventually she came around and I told her it’s normal to feel that way and she’s still important even if I spend time with her brother. 

My son has ADHD (and possibly autism, we are in the process of getting an evaluation) so he has been getting a lot of attention and she explained how she felt like she was set aside. It was a great conversation because I had no idea she had felt that way because it always seemed like she wasn’t interested in spending time with me and she would decline most of the time. We are planning on doing some fitness activity together but we are still figuring out what, she wanted to weight lift but our local gyms don’t allow children under 15. 

She even stopped wearing her jacket which I felt like was huge so I think we are making good progress. Just hoping we can stick with it through hard times as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/12y5qp6/found_out_my_daughter_is_cutting_herself/,mentalhealth

This has been the shittiest week i’ve had in a long time,"Guys, my mental health has declined so quickly this week, and I just need to get this off of my chest. 

To start with some background, I suffer from anxiety and depression, and I’m in recovery for anorexia (have been for 1 1/2 years). This semester is one of my hardest ones, as I’m taking 16 credit hours in 8 weeks, and it’s made me incredibly anxious, and has made my eating disorder come back into play. I feel like I’m dying because of the weight loss and my heart pounding at all times of the day. 

My cousin got into an extremely bad car accident two weeks ago, and she’s in a coma, had broken her neck and jaw, and the doctors are extremely pessimistic about her recovering. They believe that IF she wakes up, she’ll be a vegetable. This is my favourite cousin; she’s so hardworking, caring, and compassionate, and she has three kiddos all under age 5. Their dad is not in the picture, so they’ve been bouncing from relative to relative, and they’re at my house currently. I’m 24, in graduate school, and have no kids of my own, so this alone has flipped my world upside down. 

Last night, I got a call from my mom that my grandfather is on hospice, and will likely pass away either this weekend or early next week. I have to figure out how I’m going to get to the funeral with the kids, manage my school work (I have two exams this weekend and finals are next week), and have to find someone to cover my shifts while I travel for the funeral. 

I just feel defeated. All of my hard work to get my anxiety and eating under control feels like it’s completely for nothing. Everything feels out of control in my life, and it feels like a runaway train that I have to catch with my bare hands.

So... I just got ripped off during a drug deal gone wrong. And I'm done.,"
I've had a meth addiction for quite some time now. A few hours ago, I ended up buying some fake shit. Looked completely legit but wasn't. I had a fire in my stomach that hurt so bad I started bawling. I went to message the dude on my Facebook and found out he blocked me. So I sat there for about 5 minutes seething with rage. This is definitely not the first time this had happened. Suddenly, I started laughing. Not just giggling, but full blown hysterical howls of laughter. 

How stupid was I for allowing myself to get ripped off after several times of it happening?? I could have done something useful with that money. So I just shook my head, smiling, and got onto another Facebook account and messaged him. I simply said ""We both know what you did, and it's alright. Karma will take care of it. Peace.""

I put my phone down and immediately got up,, put my meth pipe on the floor, and stomped it, shattering it. 

I'm done. Recovery is a long road. I've beaten heroin. I can do this. 

Wish me luck, Redditors. I will need it. I love you guys. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/7xfruw/so_i_just_got_ripped_off_during_a_drug_deal_gone/,mentalhealth

What the fuck did my older brother just do?,"Hello. I'll post this because I am really... utterly disgusted and in disbelief of what just happened. I might delete this later or whatever, I don't use reddit that much.

For context, I'm F18. I left our home at the age of 17 to enter a state university miles long away from our home. It takes me months to return home and I came back for a week long vacation (for long holidays) last Monday. Since I will be returning back to the city I'm currently studying in tomorrow, I wanted to at least bond and catch up with my older brothers since I've been away for months. We weren't that close, but I understood them more now since I've accepted to just let things be (again for context, my older brother stopped in college and currently out of school youth).

I was with them (my siblings' room), we were having fun, my 2nd older brother [M21] was in the lower bunk bed and me and my oldest brother [M22] was together in the top bunk. We were laughing and all, playing games, then my brother hugged me while I was playing games in his phone while we were also chatting. It looked sweet to me because we were not really touchy, he's introverted, and I innocently thought that we're getting closer. While having fun chatting and all, he kept on caressing my stomach and asked where's my navel at, and he touched, caressed it so much that I felt gross and laughingly told him not to touch it while still playing the game. 

He then on proceeded to fucking ask ""where should I touch you then"" and unhesitatingly put his fucking disgusting hands on my chest LIKE IT WAS FUCKING NOTHING and whispered ""here? can I touch you here? please let me"" LIKE A FUCKING UNEDUCATED CREEP. I was so grossed out and can't think properly at the moment so I chose laugh it off and got out of their room saying I'm sleepy already and needed to rest since I still have a long travel for tomorrow.

It was so, so fucking creepy since I didn't expect my brother to be like that. In context, my 2nd older brother is just the same. He also did something like that when I was a minor. And I was raped when I was in preschool. I know nothing at that age, but I remember it until now. I allowed that person to do it because I know nothing... I really don't know nothing. I was so vulnerable. I was just a child. When my parents asked why my medical results says that there was blood in my vagina and all, I was so nervous, scared, and got angry at them. I didn't understand it, but in my mind I was so scared if they knew (it's like having sex and telling your parents you had sex at that age). Looking back, it was so gross and I just wanna cry. I don't want to elaborate it further about what happened afterwards. I tried to forget... even until now.

Please... please help. I've been through a lot. Not just this but things way worse than an 18-year-old should experience. Please help me😭 what should I do it felt so fucking, fucking gross like it won't ever fade away even if I scrub all over my body and bath again and again. I feel so dirty. I am so fucking mad right now. I was reminded with everything. Am I still supposed to understand, knowing that these guys know no shit? I AM SO MAD I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO I WANT TO CUT MY WR1ST AGAIN FOR DISTRACTION I CANT WITH THIS FUCKED UP LIFE IT'S HOLY WEEK FOR GOD'S SAKE WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS😭




Edit: guys I didn't think anyone would say that this whole thing is just made up. I really needed the advice but if it's like that then I can delete this. I'm sorry if my post offended anyone in any way. That hurts. It really... really hurts",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1brqstz/what_the_fuck_did_my_older_brother_just_do/,mentalhealth
Can I get a happy birthday?,"Not really related to this subreddit. it’s now 2 am in the country I live in. Anyway, started my birthday with a mental breakdown, and no one really actually cared if it’s my birthday.

Would anyone please wish me a happy birthday so I could feel better?

Edit: I’ve received so so many happy birthdays already and that means so much to me, thank all of you for your kindness and love you all, I’ve felt a lot better already. Some of you offered a listening ear, for what’s it worth, I’m supposed to do a group project with someone I used to be friend with, and she just asked me if I’m available today to discuss about our project, and that’s kinda bugging me atm:/

I’ve received two awards, I don’t use Reddit that often so I don’t really know what they do. I believe they cost money, thank you for whoever gave me the awards, but your blessings are already more than enough.

I tried to reply to all of you at first, I didn’t expect to see so many supportive and nice people, so I kinda just randomly replied. But just so you know, I’ve read all of the comments, and I wish you all a wonderful day/year/life, cuz you deserve it for being nice people :)

Edit: a lot of you mentioned that you’re late, just to clarify, my birthday is on 18th and it’s now 22:00 where I live, so it’s still not too late ;)

Even if you guys are late, still doesn’t matter. I’m just happy that there’s so many kind people on the internet<3

Edit: shoutout to that Redditor who suggested me to dress super hot , cuz I did and I felt fantastic :) shoutout to another Redditor for listening to some boring stuff that’s happening in my life, still wish I didn’t bother you that much. Shoutout to those who said they were late but actually weren’t haha. Shoutout to the those who sang me a happy birthday song with multiples o’s, u’s and y’s at the end of each line.

Is it normal to sometimes feel nothing at all?,"Sometimes I will wake up and I’ll just feel nothing all day. It’s difficult to explain, but everyone I know feels like total strangers, I don’t care about anyone anymore. I just feel completely bored, uninterested in everything. I’m still me and I don’t get those weird ‘my body isn’t real and I’m in a dream’ depersonalization thoughts. When people express fondness for me, I will feel upset because I don’t feel anything back. 

I will sometimes seek out material that upsets me deliberately in order to ‘snap out of it’ and feel something, but that doesn’t seem to work either. Usually I’ll experience intrusive thoughts and shame associated with those intrusive thoughts, but when I’m like this, I rarely get any and when I do, they don’t affect me. And then, at some point, it’ll just go away and I’ll be normal again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hp8m4w/is_it_normal_to_sometimes_feel_nothing_at_all/,mentalhealth

Reminding me my death will hurt people makes it worse,"Constantly being told things like ""think about how it will affect those who love you"" or ""please don't, there are people who love and very much care about you"" produces the exact opposite feeling intended. I don't even feel empathy anymore, if those around me died, I wouldn't feel anything but inconvenienced. 

It's essentially telling me my suffering and pain I feel every second of every day is less important than the emotions of the people around me, and that wanting it all to finally end is ""selfish"". 

It reduces my existence to nothing more than a NPC character on the lives of others, I only exist for their benefit, and everything I feel is necessary to continue experiencing for their benefit. Fuck this, Fuck them, Fuck it all. I want to do something selfish for once, and not have to worry about how everyone else feels for once.

"The first time I went to therapy was because my mom wanted to know what was wrong with me, once she knew that something was up she never took me back.","It was in middle school and I don’t remember much of it, but I remember that I didn’t know how to socialize or approach to people.

One day I was crying and having a mental breakdown and my mom got so mad at me because I would not stop yelling and sobbing.

A sudden point she said that we needed to go to the doctor and I was asking her why.
She told me these exact words “we are going to a doctor to see what the **** is wrong with you”.


Total confusion, didn’t know what she meant, we got into the car and we went to a weird place that I don’t remember what it was exactly, I know for sure that there was people that where waiting in the hallway and some of them where injured.

They called out my mom’s name and we went into an office, they where sitting two woman, they started to ask me questions, like how I was doing and what I liked to do in the free time etc.

I didn’t talk because of anxiety, literally not a word.

A sudden point they asked if they could talk to me alone without my mom, she said yes.

A sudden point I just started crying after she left the room, I was telling them that I didn’t want to live anymore And that everything was so stressful for me, specially at school because everyone was making fun on me.

They continued asking me questions and told them that I was not happy and didn’t want to do anything because I felt like it would serve me no purpose.

I talked to them for an hour, after that they let my mother in, they told her that I needed to come back because clearly something was wrong and they needed to starting sessions with me to help me out.

Once we got home my mom really got angry at me, she literally told me that all that was a waste of time and that of course something was wrong with me but she didn’t want to spend another penny on me for my problems.

My wife got raped and I am looking for explanations ,"Hello Reddit,

my wife and I have been together for almost 10 years now. We both are in our early 30‘s. She‘s a very happy and joyful person, and she‘s a blessing for everyone who is around her. She deeply cares about her friends and family and would give her last penny for them, if she had to. 

Recently, in a very tough conversation, she told me that when she was 9 years old, she got raped by her cousin who was around 13-14 years old at the time. Her mom and dad broke up when she was only two years old and when she had to stay with her dad, he usually parked her at her aunts place so he could date other women in peace without his child bothering him. Of course, her aunt asked the kids to play in her sons room, unaware of what was going to happen. My wife told me that he had two boxes, filled with toys under his bed. And when she was going to reach under the bed to pull out a bunch of toys, he grabbed her by the neck, pushed her deeper under the bed, pulled down her pants and did the unthinkable. 

She told me that this wasn’t the only time. She had to stay at her aunts place frequently, sleeping in her cousins room when she had to stay over night, with him in the same bed. So he used the opportunity again and again over the course of 5-6 years. 

You can imagine that I was … I can’t even find a word to describe how I felt hearing this. And since then, I try to be there for her of course and I have been a LOT over the past few weeks. But there’s also still me and my feelings. I don’t talk about the way I feel about all of this to my wife because I don’t think it’s appropriate. I am not the victim, she suffered and still suffers way more than I do, no question about it. I just try to wrap my head around how a child is able to do something like that to an even younger child. Again and again. When my wife finally put a hold to it, he must’ve been somewhere around 18-20 years old, while she was 14 or 15. Maybe someone in here can offer me some insight in what‘s going on in the head of such a person. I know that I won’t find a definitive answer, but I feel like I just need something to hold onto. I just don’t understand and I really could use some help. I beg you people, please help me.
