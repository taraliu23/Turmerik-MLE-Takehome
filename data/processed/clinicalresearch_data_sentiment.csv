Clinical Research Role/Salary Master Form & Spreadsheet,"Note: 2024-JUL-14: For any line deletions or edits, please tell me the line number, so that I don‚Äôt have to follow up for it. 

**UPDATE 2023-SEP-05:**   
*Any responses before line 3429 did not have these updates.*

* Added a column for ""year salary was applicable"": You can put a single year or a range of years. Answer is limited to only 9 characters in hopes that there will only be numerical values and the dash, ex: 1989-2023. It is optional as it is implied that the salary added is the salary received in the year of the timestamp.
* Added data rules to salary: It is now only limited to numbers so no symbols can be added and no varying answers.
* Added ""salary comments"" in case anyone wanted to elaborate on their salary. It is optional.
* Column A is now unhid, but small so you still need to expand it. This is for the timestamp.

I made a Google form that we can all fill out anonymously about our role and salary. u/snoopypoo31's recent post is what initiated the creation. I based it off responses from their thread, from my colleagues‚Äô suggestions, & from the [original media spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11obKJpckWJNyEYPdhHM0iaGp0x4QoVk_7aitRC5zVlc/edit#gid=70710369) I had previously mentioned. Please feel free to share with your colleagues in the field. I really hope this can be a resource for people. I think it's important to have transparency & it can help with wage or contract negotiations.

I GOT A PHARMA JOB TODAY AFTER 5 MONTHS OF APPLYING!!!,"I got ACRP-certified in March and today, 5 months **to the day** after that, I got an offer for a CTA role. Fully remote, great benefits, and a $19,000 (USD) pay increase from my current CRC position.

My ex left me the very same day I got certified. I didn't sign a new lease when my current one ended in case I found a new job. I lived in my car for a week before finding a month-to-month room. Now, I can move to a fabulous new city and live my best life.

To all those struggling: ***Don't give up hope!*** You *will* find something, I swear! I'm living proof!

ETA: If I could give current applicants one piece of advice, it would be to send your resumes to companies who look like they could theoretically offer your desired role.

site perspective," 

This sub largely takes the side of the CRO/monitor; therefore, I have taken it upon myself to offer up the following rebuttal. Over the years, I have watched monitoring turn from a relatively collaborative and pleasant working relationship to a check-box, outdated spreadsheet, email shit show. Every fucking one of you is a helpless baby. Every fucking one of you is deluded into thinking that your week-old reports and high importance emails have some impact upon the way we conduct research and produce data. 

Specifically, you think sending duplicate emails about ‚Äúcritical‚Äù queries that I quietly resolved this morning has some impact upon the way that I, personally, produce data. It does not. You wouldn‚Äôt know good quality data if it tried to sell you essential oils.

Fuck you. Fuck you and your study‚Äôs decision to have multiple central labs, each with their own unnecessarily cumbersome portal. Fuck Cerba and fuck LabCorp and fuck PPD. I don‚Äôt have two goddamn weeks to wait for your disease marker labs to result, and neither do the patients. Fuck your central lab for claiming that every single PK was ‚Äúnot received by the vendor‚Äù while some other ignorant, brain-dead desk occupant issues a query on that very sample. Did you get it or did you fucking not? Make better lab requisitions and quit querying for information that is on the actual lab requisition. If you make us use a special digital pen that somehow transmits lab req data in real time (no it doesn‚Äôt), I will personally cancel Christmas.¬†¬† 

Fuck you. Fuck your study‚Äôs ‚Äúcentral imaging vendor,‚Äù specifically Clario. We are the largest hospital for 900 fucking miles; you have our phantom imaging already and you have our ‚Äúqualification images‚Äù already. You wouldn't know how to read a PET/CT report if it was written in the format of Goodnight Moon. You probably don‚Äôt even know the difference between a contrast and non-con CT, and I know to fuck you don‚Äôt understand why we literally cannot MRI a pregnant woman 5 years into remission just because you think you need imaging at this point.¬† 

Gadolinium is not a con med. CT contrast is not a con med. Heparin for central line care is not a con med. Glucose testing strips are not a con med. This man is not just ‚Äútaking Narcan‚Äù because it‚Äôs on his med list; he has 4 fucking opioid prescriptions because cancer hurts. I‚Äôm not adding Narcan to con meds unless he *uses* it. Fuck you.¬† 

Fuck you. Fuck your protocol deviations. Maybe if one of your severely overcompensated project managers could bother comparing the protocol calendar to the footnotes they copied-and-pasted from a different protocol, deviations wouldn‚Äôt be inherent to the study.¬† 

Fuck you. Fuck your follow-up letters. They‚Äôre never on time, but it wouldn‚Äôt matter if they were because the vast majority of them are wrong. You didn‚Äôt list your co-monitors. You didn‚Äôt include the specifically requested list of pages that you source verified. You assumed missing data points were deviations, even though you *know* for a fucking *fact* that the EDC isn‚Äôt built in line with the actual protocol. You haven‚Äôt bothered to close out all the ‚Äúaction items‚Äù from last time that I already told you had been done. And, honestly, if we‚Äôre going down this road, I shouldn‚Äôt have to tell you that they were done; you should be actively, you know, *monitoring* open action items and closing them your goddamn self. If you send me the last visit‚Äôs follow-up letter the day before or the day of your next monitoring visit, I will personally call iMedidata to ask that your username be un-associated with every study and every site you have. If you send the follow-up letter to only the PI, or to everyone except me because you‚Äôre going behind my back to get the answer you want again, I will hire a man to steal every one of your packages for the next *year*. 

Fuck you. Fuck your ‚Äúmetrics.‚Äù Metrics are an ICON problem or an IQVIA problem. They mean nothing to me and they never will because I know more than you and I am better than you. I know what visits have happened and I know what visits are upcoming and I will manage them on my end, my way.¬† 

Patient 0049 is not coming in for her 12-month follow-up because she *died last January*.¬† 

Fuck you. Fuck your SOPs. If you love SOPs so goddamn much and are really and truly committed to following them, then why don‚Äôt you read ours? You know, the ones that every one of our staff sends to you, just to be sure you got it? The SOP that says that I am the gatekeeper of the source documents, the one that says I and I alone approve co-monitors and extended visits? Don‚Äôt request your visit for next week because you have a ‚Äúdatabase lock‚Äù coming up. No, you don‚Äôt. You just suck at planning and are trying to make it my problem.¬† 

Fuck you. Fuck your EKGs. The study EKG machine is a waste of space and time and deserves to be catapulted into the sea. You wrote triplicate EKGs into your protocol and we obtained triplicate EKGs, and a medical doctor even signed them. And yet. And yet, fucking IQVIA wants to argue about which one is the ‚Äútrue‚Äù EKG and which ones are the ‚Äúrepeats,‚Äù the ‚Äúduplicates.‚Äù None of them, you absolute wretches. There are three of them because that is what ‚Äútriplicate‚Äù means. Get your vendors under control or I will personally obtain Doctor of Veterinary Medicine licensure and euthanize them myself.¬† 

Fuck you. Fuck your equipment calibration and maintenance reports. We run patients through the lab, the clinic, CT, PET, X-ray, MRI, port placement, treatment rooms, biopsy suites hundreds of times a day. What the fuck do you know about PET scan maintenance? How would you ever know if a centrifuge was working or not? You‚Äôve probably never even seen one from the vacuous bliss of your greige home office. 

Fuck you. Fuck your start dates for medical history and con meds, and fuck you for asking. Tell me, how exactly, on the back end, the statistical end, the end that becomes a journal publication, this is remotely important? You can‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs fucking not. You and your walleyed, empty-headed data managers don‚Äôt know and you can‚Äôt know because there is nothing to know. It does not matter.¬† 

Fuck you and fuck your email habits. Do not email me with a subject line of ‚Äúquestion.‚Äù Do not start a new thread for every fucking question you have. Fuck your propensity to send me 45 emails every day and then to ignore anything I send to you. Adding a random-ass column to your redundant, out of date spreadsheet is not an answer to my question. If you follow up with me in under 24 hours and loop in the PI for anything other than a patient dying on study, I will find your home address. I will arrive dressed as the UPS person and ask for your signature, and the moment your eyes dart down to my clipboard, I will linebacker you into a brick fucking wall. I will break you in half. I will suck the marrow from your bones. 

Fuck you and fuck your regulatory monitoring visits. Fuck you for failing to file all the shit you collect. The trainings, the notes-to-file, the drug accountability, the certificates of analysis, the aforementioned calibration records (fuck you). Fuck your training log that requires PI signature at the bottom and PI initials on every line. The woman has lives to save and she does not have time for this absolute paper pusher bullshit.¬† 

Fuck your ‚Äúsponsor required‚Äù monthly coordinator calls. Tell me why I have to put up with your useless ass doing a regular monitoring visit for 3 days every month, *and* I have to have some random other bullshit call with you every 4th Monday in which we spend 30 seconds making small talk followed by you saying, ‚ÄúWell, this will be short since there‚Äôs nothing outstanding and you have no patients.‚Äù I fucking know that.

Medpace is a horrible CRO. I sympathise with all of you who work there,"Throwaway because I'm still traumatized by this horrible place.

Years ago I worked for Medpace for a bit over a year.

I received a very poor salary and told them I had a job offer, so gave them a chance to match.
They refused to match.

Then I handed in my notice and told them I would go to another CRO and that I wouldn't take any remuneration to respect the non-compete clause they put in my contract.
I just wanted to go to another CRO and didn't expect any additional compensation from them.

They went into my personal Gmail through the firewall ( I was so stupid to log in on the work device ) , went through my offer and were talking in my presence how to prevent me from leaving for another CRO.

I felt terrorised in my last weeks.
The entire office was no longer allowed to talk to me and everyday HR called me into their office to ask details about my new job.
I refused to tell them and then was told : "" we will find out through LinkedIn and other ways"".

I had to go to work with tremendous amounts of anxiety.

I can still not understand how any company can be this psychopathic towards their work forces.

Years after it happened they still terrify me.

I went from being one of their most beloved employees to persona non-grata in 1 day.
I was also not allowed to come to the summer event while I was still employed but in my notice period.

Made an awful mistake,"Hi all,

I made a bad mistake at work today and ended up crying in my office because of it. 

I work as a CRC in oncology and have been working with this patient since I got him consented end of July for a trial. I originally had him set to start treatment end of August with his screening procedures almost complete. Then I found out he was going out of town that day and needed to reschedule. 

Sure enough, rescheduling put him out of window for a screening procedure. That procedure was getting another tumor resection surgery. I explained this to the patient that if he were to reschedule and still want to be on trial, he would need to repeat this surgery for screening. He said he was okay doing that. 

Fast forward to today. His path results from his surgery end of September showed he was eligible for the study. Every other eligibility criteria looked good. 

Then I saw a sentence in the criteria I overlooked. It said that the patient had to be registered within a year of last dose of previous treatment drug. The expiration date for that was 7 days ago‚Ä¶.

So in my horror and realization I went to the sponsor (a co-op, just my luck) and pleaded with them to make an exemption, as it was only a few days since the deadline. They said no and that patient was ineligible. 

So now the doctors are mad and I had to make a hard call to the patient explaining my error and that after all this time and things they did for the trial, they can not go on. Because of one sentence I overlooked. 

I have been feeling awful and sick to my stomach this entire day. I feel like I let the patient and physicians down. I am usually very good at my job, but I don‚Äôt know how I let this one slide past me.

Stop Trying to Become a CRA,"There are so many better options. I see so many study coordinators thinking their best next move is to become a CRA. 

I can tell you there are so many other options that will open so many more doors and earning potential. Becoming a CRA actually limits you unless you want to have a career in auditing, quality, or compliance. All they do is monitor clinical trials and travel non-stop to crappy places for 1-2 days at a time.

Medpace Glassdoor rating Plummets to 2.9 - Employees Stand Together and boycott quarterly meeting ,"Ladies and gentlemen, gather around. In an America as divided as a Thanksgiving turkey at your in-laws, there‚Äôs one place that is united like never before: MedFart. I mean, they‚Äôve really brought us all together ‚Äì just not in the way August ‚ÄúTainthole‚Äù thought when he proudly decreed that, if we want remote work, we can take a hike to ‚Äúanother job.‚Äù

Yeah, Tainthole, ‚Äòcause nothing says ‚Äúgreat leadership‚Äù like telling your employees to get lost. And nothing screams ‚Äútotally relatable CEO‚Äù like rolling up to the office in your Cybertruck, looking like a villain in a low-budget sci-fi film. Seriously, he‚Äôs like if Steve Jobs and Elon Musk had a weird, awkward love child who only wears black turtlenecks and dreams of a workforce made entirely out of AI clones. You almost expect him to bust out a little evil laugh every time he takes a sip of his oat milk latte.

But, of course, our fearless leader has ‚Äúvision‚Äù ‚Äì which apparently involves taking away 26 work-from-home days. Not that we‚Äôre counting. (No, really, we are. It‚Äôs 26!) And in his grand wisdom, he‚Äôs shocked that the in-person meeting attendance after this new policy hit rock-bottom. It‚Äôs like watching a guy throw a party, scream at everyone to ‚Äúget in here!‚Äù and then wonder why no one‚Äôs having fun. Even HR was like, ‚ÄúUh, yeah, record-low turnout ‚Äì shocker, August.‚Äù

And let‚Äôs talk about that Glassdoor rating, baby! Together, like a band of annoyed-but-anonymous office warriors, we tanked that rating from a 3.2 to a gloriously honest 2.9 in less than a month. Cheers to us! This is the kind of teamwork they should actually put on a corporate retreat poster.

And yeah, a few folks got a raise to ‚Äúmake up for‚Äù the WFH rule. Oh, gee, thanks! Nothing says ‚Äúwe value you‚Äù like a ‚Äúhey, here‚Äôs a couple more bucks, now sit at your desk under the fluorescent lights and dream of the work-from-home life you once had.‚Äù

But here‚Äôs the thing ‚Äì this is just the beginning. We‚Äôre not done yet, folks. If you haven‚Äôt left your two cents on Glassdoor yet, now‚Äôs the time. Get creative, get funny, go full burner account. Just make sure you‚Äôre not putting down your real job title or location, ‚Äòcause we all know August would love nothing more than to run a machine-learning algorithm to figure out who said he looks like the CEO of a failed tech startup.

So here‚Äôs to all of you, my fellow MedSh*t comrades. Let‚Äôs keep fighting the good fight, one one-star review at a time.

"Mods need to make a specific post section dedicated to ""How can I get into clinical research or be a CRA, etc?"" for the people that are clueless","This post should be pinned to the top of this entire subreddit.

Too many people are asking repeated questions when there is a search bar and moderators should implement a ban for those spamming or just being downright  entitled thinking the expierence they have should be able to get them a job. 

 ""Applying to CRA jobs with 1 year of expierence but im not hearing anything from recruiters. I have XYZ experience, i don't get why i can't get a CRA job right now. My coworker was able to be a CRA back then but now i can't become a CRA when i have same qualifications as her"".

This is the harsh truth but if you're planning to enter a research field, then you should be able to a simple search on what has been asked or posted to this subreddit. 

**A sense of reality for those asking how to enter or reasons why you're not getting a job:** you're not qualified in this new market. Some say you can be unlucky. Sure, you can get unlucky, but the former is more realistic in this job market.

People are getting laid off as many people have been commenting here, there are people who have more work expierence and higher science degrees that isn't in underwater basket weaving, the market now is different back then compared to COVID post boom where employers were hiring english or arts major with 0 work expierence in retail or nothing related to clinical research. If you are requiring sponsorship or some kind of work visa, your chances of winning the lottery are higher than getting a job on this market. 

If you are looking for to increase your chances to work in this new industry here are some requirements:

You volunteer for clinical research labs, do an internship, or if you are lucky enough, land a clinical research assistant or related job that are hard to come by nowadays now. Expierence should be 2 years minimum but there are people on the market right now who can't land a job with that much expierence so 5+ years is looking like the new norm. Go back to school if aren't finding anything (sciences). Education at clown College does not help, but at least PhD or masters is better than a bachelors if you can't get into a reputable college.

The Roast of August Tainthole,"Ladies and gentlemen, gather 'round for a legendary roast of the one and only August Tainthole, the CEO of Methpace.

I heard ol' August decided to roll up to work in his fancy Tesla truck, probably thinking it's a real flex after denying raises and yanking away those sweet, sweet work-from-home days from his employees. I mean, when you're driving a shiny electric vehicle while your workers are shuffling in & out like sardines, you know you've hit peak out-of-touch CEO status.

You know things are majorly fucked up when employees have to badge out at work as if they're serving time in Medpace State Penitentiary. I can just picture August sitting in his corner office, stroking a hairless cat, cackling maniacally as he watches his minions tap their badges like inmates on lock down.

And let's talk about that town hall meeting debacle. August apparently decided to do his best impression of a malfunctioning robot, shutting down the Q+A session faster than you can say ""unemployment line."" ""No questions unless you have the guts to stand up and ask me right now,"" he declared, before strutting off like a peacock with a superiority complex. Bravo, August, bravo - who needs transparency when you have an ego the size of a superyacht?

So here's to August Tainthole, a true visionary in the field of making employees' lives a living hell. Medpace may be many things, but hey, at least it's consistent - consistently fucked up.

Love to see ICON burn to the ground and see upper management lose their bonus checks when they treat ICON employees like hot garbage shit!!!

For those that don't understand, if upper management are usually granted stock incentives, stock options, stock packages. If company makes more money through lay offs and over working, upper management stocks increases.

So, if stock options were part of their employment, like the VP for example, with a 200 option package for √ó10, they just lost $43000 ü§£ üòÇ üòπ üòÜ ü§£

We've all heard the stories of layoffs, and we've all watched our merit increases get pushed back only to be crappy, again. We all watch our bonus targets seemingly fall every year while Ari and company seem to cash in big time on their incentives and bonuses. We're about to start reviewing our goal progress for 2024 and WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN OUR RAISES FROM 2023 YET. We've all seen the emails from Ari and other department heads about leadership positions being backfilled when we're constantly denied backfills for positions that should be filled on the day-to-day teams. We're all watching leadership pat themselves on the back and puff their chests out to the shareholders while we all suffer daily.

- reliable bonuses, no loop holes for withholding. It was hard for C-suite to screw you when you sat outside their office door or ate with them at lunch. 
- you got a job at <enter BIG Pharma name> and you stayed until you retired because you were treated well (and you gave them your best)

She went on and sort of back-tracked to the benefits they offer, PTO, etc. but then continued and said if you're leaving your current job due to that, I would say this isn't the right fit for you.

PI says I need to take more initiative - I call every potentially eligible patient for pre-screening, update our recruitment database, and communicate the updates with the study team. For our enrolled participants, I ensure all data and source documents are entered/uploaded on time, queries are addressed ASAP, sponsor emails are replied to in a timely manner, and visits are prepared for in advance. PI proceeds to complain that their previous CRC was better and I should do more. PI never says a simple ‚Äúthank you‚Äù - just demands more.

I‚Äôm at a breaking point. I have great supports at and outside of work, but I feel myself starting to crumble under all the pressure and stress. My patients and co-workers are the highlight of my job. But management is toxic, PIs are never satisfied, and everyone blames their mistakes on me.

Help!! ,"I‚Äôve been a CRA for a year! I spent the first 9 months as a start up CRA and now I‚Äôve started monitoring. I.Am.STRUGGLING!!

I honestly do not understand how CRAs do it. There is just too much to do?! I never feel accomplished and therefore my motivation is dropping at a steady rate. I‚Äôm already burnt out from the travelling and my work life balance is in the bin. 

All this is coming as a shock to me as I‚Äôve always been good at any role I‚Äôve had within clinical research. I guess I am also struggling to come to grips with not feeling like I know what I‚Äôm doing. My imposter syndrome is stepping on my neck!!

Try CRC to Site Manager Instead of CRA,"I wanted to share my experience since a lot of people seem to think that the only way to move up and out of the CRC role is to move to a CRA role.

I‚Äôm currently a Sr. Program Manager at a small biotech and here was my career path over the last 6 years. . . 

Clinical research assistant -> Clinical research coordinator -> 
Sr. Certified CRC -> 
Study Site Manager -> 
Trial Manager at  Sponsor ->
Program Manager at Sponsor ->
Sr. Program Manager at Sponsor.

I started at $35k per year and now make over $190k. 

I think the secret is to not stay in any role for more than a year and never stop interviewing / reaching for more. 

Apply for positions you don‚Äôt think you qualify for and ask for money you don‚Äôt think you deserve. 


Anyways, that‚Äôs my experience. I‚Äôve put in a lot of work and long hours but it pays off!

Maintaining a Healthy Lifestyle While on the Road as a CRA," Maintaining a Healthy Lifestyle While on the Road as a CRA   


A bit of background: I‚Äôm a Senior CRA who, other than for a period during COVID, has been traveling nearly every week for the past 5 years conducting site visits across the country. I played soccer throughout my life and have generally been fairly fit, however when I first started travelling as a CRA I quickly developed some pretty bad habits that caused me to put on weight. As I‚Äôm sure many of you working in clinical research who travel frequently have found out: free food + free alcohol + sedentary lifestyle + bad sleep = sacrifices to your overall health.   
 

I wanted to put together a list of  ‚Äútips and tricks‚Äù that I am currently using to lose weight while  maintaining muscle  on the road, and I would love to hear other people‚Äôs strategies for remaining healthy while travelling too, so please let me know if you have any!   
 

**FOOD** **‚Äì** Food is probably the single hardest part of travelling for work (for me), as I love cooking and I find it so much easier to eat healthily at home compared to being on the road. I don‚Äôt like counting calories so I don‚Äôt do that at home or while travelling, but here‚Äôs the strategy I‚Äôm using currently (trying to lose a bit of weight for the summer body!).  

*  I like to go a grocery store at the beginning of a trip and pick up some healthy snacks (bananas, berries, nuts). I usually try to grab stuff high in protein as well ‚Äì Greek yogurt, protein shakes (recently discovered the fairlife core power brand available pretty much everywhere‚Äîfiltered milk that legitimately tastes like normal chocolate milk for 42g protein, and only 220 calories). Orgain has similar products, and I‚Äôm sure there are a bunch of other brands. These are usually kind of pricey but that‚Äôs not a concern when your company is paying for it. These protein shakes will help keep you full in between meals and will help you hit your protein for the day too of course.
* When choosing restaurants to eat out at, I try to pick places where I know I can get reasonably healthy options. Some of my go-to‚Äôs : Mediterranean food restaurants (chicken shawarma bowl with all of the salad and veggies, a bit of tzatziki sauce, YUM!), chipotle style Mexican restaurants where I can choose the ingredients (I like getting bowls with protein + beans + veggies + salsa), be careful because if you get everything + guacamole you can easily eat a days‚Äô worth of calories in a single meal with these types of spots. I also like to google ‚Äúhealthy food near me‚Äù and there will usually be some kind of spot serving healthy wraps / salads etc.   
 
* I‚Äôm not a big fan of hotel breakfasts so I usually skip breakfast and just have coffee. I‚Äôll bring protein bars with me on site so I can have those earlier in the day if I get hungry too. For dinner again I just try to be as reasonable about things as I can. This is obviously just personal preference‚Äîif you need breakfast / can‚Äôt have coffee on an empty stomach, this is not an option for you.   
 
* Coffee is amazing, and it is absolutely critical that you consume it if you work in clinical research and I won‚Äôt hear otherwise. Caffeine also suppresses appetite so it‚Äôs good for maintaining / losing weight if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre trying to do. That being said, your coffee probably shouldn‚Äôt be some 200 calorie sugar bomb if those are your goals. In general, I try to limit the calories I consume in liquid form to very close to zero while dieting.   
 
* In general I find that being stressed / bored can lead to me over eating, it‚Äôs good to be mindful of whether or not you‚Äôre actually hungry, and be very proactive of managing stress, which is easer said than done in our industry. I do find exercise to be very helpful for managing my stress which brings us too‚Ä¶  
 

**GYM ‚Äì** This is obviously very specific to people who weight lift but I think resistance training in one form or another is a fundamental (in combination with cardio, healthy eating, good sleep) to overall health.   
 

* Hotel gyms aren‚Äôt ideal, but you can still get a great work out in using dumbbells in combination with calisthenics, it just requires a bit more creativity. For chest / arms - Most hotel dumbbells only go up to 50lbs, but if you‚Äôre doing a dumbbell bench press, for example, you can super-set your pressing movements with pushups (or triangle push ups, or other modifications to make it harder), and I guarantee you will be able to reach failure even if you‚Äôre used to pushing heavier weight üòä. Biceps and triceps are pretty easy to work out with dumbbells (curls, extensions, etc) . Back is a bit tricky, but I do like dumbbell rows. Shoulders are easy to hit (seated or standing military press, Arnold press, lateral raises).   
 
* I hate training legs in hotel gym but you gotta do what you gotta do ‚Äì my go to exercises here are Bulgarian split squats, lunges, and even high rep kettle bell squats.   
 
* The best tip I have for hotel gyms is trying to stay at hotels with slightly nicer gym equipment, a lot of hotels now have cable machines and pull up bars which make life much easier when trying to get a good workout in. Some hotels have full gyms with bench press / smith machine racks set ups, and these are obviously ideal but it‚Äôs hard to find these unless you‚Äôre staying in a nice hotel in a major city.   
 
* Obviously the single most important thing here is to apply progressive overload ‚Äì make sure you are tracking your gym sessions (at minimum tracking your reps / sets/ and weight used for at least your compound lifts, and trying to improve week to week).   
 

**ALCOHOL ‚Äì** It‚Äôs so tempting to indulge in alcohol when travelling, especially when you‚Äôre travelling with coworkers, and ESPESCIALLY when you‚Äôve just had a bad / stressful experience on site having to deal with piles of late reported AEs/SAEs, PDs etc. I used to drink WAY too often on the road and now I basically don‚Äôt drink while travelling for work at all. Alcohol is ‚Ä¶ objectively very bad for your health. But it‚Äôs fun. So just do with that what you will but please be mindful that if you‚Äôre trying to maintain/lose weight, reducing or cutting out drinking during your work week will have a more dramatic effect on your results than you probably think.  
 

**CARDIO¬≠** **‚Äì** The biggest thing that helped me here was getting a fitness watch, and setting a goal of hitting a minimum of 10K steps / day. I get most of my steps from walking outside, or setting a treadmill at an incline and walking or jogging. I personally don‚Äôt like running, but if you like running then obviously that‚Äôs a great thing to do during your trips. Walking is super under rated for staying in shape, and it really isn‚Äôt that hard to hit your 10K a day as long as you‚Äôre prioritizing moving around whenever possible. If you need to set your goal lower (I would say minimum 8K steps a day), that‚Äôs also totally reasonable. If you‚Äôre in an airport waiting for a flight and you‚Äôve finished working, start walking laps üòä. No reason to just sit there when you already spend so much time sitting on planes, sitting in cars, sitting at the clinic surrounded by 20 study binders. I always bring sneakers on trips for gym + if I see people playing pick up basketball / soccer while driving I will hop in to games if I have time.   
   
**SLEEP** **‚Äì** Focus on getting ATLEAST 7 hours of quality sleep every night. Doing any kind of site visit with not enough sleep is miserable, but in general the benefits of sleep for maintaining your health are too numerous to spell out here. I try to get at least 8 hours every night. Yes sometimes when travel to sites gets messed up, or when you‚Äôre over allocated, this isn‚Äôt possible, but that should be a rare occurrence. If you‚Äôre frequently having to combine travel to sites in a way that negatively impacts your sleep then that brings us too‚Ä¶  
 

**GENERAL MINDSET / COMMON MISTAKES** **‚Äì** The single biggest mistake I have seen (and of course I have made this mistake myself too many times to count) is putting work before your own physical health + sanity. Clinical research is fast paced, and extremely stressful career field to work in. Being a CRA, especially for a CRO, means you have pressure from all sides (sponsor, CRO line managers, CTMs, sites), you have metrics to keep up with, and you have a non-stop pile of work and you‚Äôll rarely be ‚Äúcaught up‚Äù fully. Lots of posts in this sub reflect this stress. The big thing here is that it is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, whether you are sponsor side or working for a CRO, to advocate for yourself. You need to learn to say NO and that is an extremely hard skill to learn for some people (myself included). You need to recognize that your health is infinitely more important than a DOS metric. That all being said, good luck in your careers and please share any travel advice for clinical research professionals who might stumble into this thread!   
 

*TLDR: Try to be kind to your body while travelling as a CRA, otherwise you‚Äôll end up looking yucky.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/148ngk2/maintaining_a_healthy_lifestyle_while_on_the_road/,clinicalresearch,-0.9885298609733582
Being a CRC is like working in the food industry ,"I don‚Äôt mean it in a sense that they are comparable. Both are hard in their own right. But I think that working at a site should be a requirement for any person who works in research. Just like how I think everyone should hold at least one food service role to have a basic level of respect for their waiter or waitress.
 
I currently work for a sponsor (was previously at a site for 5 years in reg) and you can tell the people who have worked for a site and those who have not. Especially when it comes to developing a protocol. They literally have no idea everything that happens when a patient walks through those clinic doors. I wish those people had to do a ‚Äúday in the life‚Äù of a CRC. Just shadow ONE patient visit. Sit in on a phase I PK infusion and see how it affects the CRCs, the patient and their families. I‚Äôd love to see them try to juggle consenting visits, respond to queries and meet with a monitor all in one day. 

So respect to all of those who are currently or were once research coordinators. You are seriously the backbone of this industry.  ",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1dkv9r6/being_a_crc_is_like_working_in_the_food_industry/,clinicalresearch,0.9944557547569275

Medpoop ‚Äúwins‚Äù top places to work? Donuts are rationed,"Medshit has a new scandal, and it‚Äôs not just barring the employees they recently fired from getting new jobs with their insane non-compete üç© 

Medfart attempted a new strategy to keep employees locked in their prison cells (or maybe I should say cubes) and this time, it‚Äôs with the ‚ÄúTop Places to Work‚Äù award that they celebrated by passing out DONUTS. Only one per employee. Employees were later seen in the break room cutting up donuts with a knife to share because they didn‚Äôt have enough for all of the employees in the office. **That‚Äôs right - Medturd employees were rationing out donuts.  ** More than likely because so many people are in the office after their work from home days were taken away. Guess they didn‚Äôt consider that!

But how would the exec team be expected to know this when majority of them don‚Äôt live here? Can‚Äôt blame them! I guess they must all have a loophole for the WFH policy and it‚Äôs just the peasants that must follow it. 

I‚Äôm pretty sure the main goal of this place is to fatten up their employees so that they can‚Äôt move from their desks and have to work all day. They can‚Äôt afford ANY extra work from home days - can‚Äôt afford to keep quality employees who were so overworked and burnt out that they did not follow that policy to a T‚Ä¶. but CHERRY COKE is on the menu day in and day out baby with FREE SODA IN EVERY BREAK ROOM! That‚Äôs how they CLEARLY won this award‚Ä¶.the award that doesn‚Äôt cost a dime to win‚Ä¶. Or does it ü§î do a quick google search and find out for yourself (you pay to play, nobody actually wins). 

Top places to work, more like top places to quit and run for your life.

A few months ago, I was hospitalized for a life-threatening medical emergency. I was forced to take an unplanned medical leave (with proper documentation). When I returned, my PI criticized me in front of the entire team, saying I am the reason one of the studies did not enroll any patients for the month. 

I am planning to exit the field and go back to school next year, but the mental toll of being a site CRC is really affecting me. I have lovely colleagues and patients, and that‚Äôs what keeps me going most days. But the toxic management and PI‚Äôs make me question how I can stay another year.

Sponsors: Please pressure your CRO to properly resource CRAs. You have a lot more power than you think and this is one of the most impactful things that you can do for your trial.,"I am so damn tired of horrible CRA resourcing at these CROs. I‚Äôm sick of having to work twice as hard to cover up the fact that the CRO has 3 CRAs on the trial when they should have 5 and 2 of the 3 are on so many protocols they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up from down on your project. 

It‚Äôs like this at damn near every CRO, and guess who gets prioritized when there‚Äôs actually CRAs available? The sponsors that pay attention, speak up, and demand it. 

Sponsors truly need to ask more questions about the CRAs they are getting. Not just review their CV, approve them, and that‚Äôs it. You need to know how many trials they are on. You need to check on this frequently so they don‚Äôt deprioritize your study. You need to confirm they have adequate time to maintain the monitoring plan requirements for your study. 

So many times in my career, I‚Äôve seen this happen. Over and over, the CRO didn‚Äôt want to hire enough staff and/or didn‚Äôt want to hire experienced staff due to costs. And it absolutely impacts your study. There‚Äôs a direct link between CRA oversight & management of their site and enrollment, data issues, audit findings, TMF issues, etc. 

We all know this, so why do we continue to let CROs play these games? Everyone seems to just accept it as the way it is, and I‚Äôm seriously tired of it. 

And both sponsors and CROs need to be more honest and realistic about the costs to have adequate staffing to reach the agreed upon milestones. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1dfp0q7/sponsors_please_pressure_your_cro_to_properly/,clinicalresearch,-0.9872124791145325

I love my job,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share a bit about my job as a Clinical Research Coordinator because I thought someone might appreciate hearing a positive story.

I work as a coordinator for a mobile clinic that serves a major Texas city to helping individuals with substance use disorders. Many of our participants are unhoused and facing incredibly challenging circumstances.

Our team is very effective, and we've helped many people get their lives back on track. We've even had a few success stories, with some participants returning to college to earn their degrees. 

It's very fulfilling having participants coming back and thank us. Ive cry my eyes out from happiness as well as sadness whenever I have to report a SAE on some participants. 

I presume that other coordinator that also help the community have the same sense of fulfillment.

Of course, I cannot life off feelings, the payment might not be comparable to a CR Associate working on the private sector, but right now, I'm very happy where I'm at and want to continue to help the individuals on my study to better themselves.

Instead, here‚Äôs the real way to make some noise: hit them with a Glassdoor review. Keep it clean‚Äîno name-calling, no wild accusations (save that for our exclusive Medfart chat here or the Halloween party). Make it count with thoughtful, respectful points about how this WFH update is affecting you.

And speaking of horror shows, let‚Äôs not forget the Halloween party they‚Äôre throwing after on ‚Äútogether we collectively want to die Tuesday‚Äù ‚Äîpulling out all the stops with a bowl of candy corn, an 2012 Spotify playlist, and one lonely clearance pumpkin. August will probably roll in dressed as ‚ÄòCEO of the Year,‚Äô which, let‚Äôs be honest, is the scariest costume anyone could come up with.

"AMaA - 20-years clinical research industry experience, currently CRA Line Manager.","There have been so many posts here asking about the industry environment, job market, how to get experience, how to get an interview, what happens after an interview, etc. 

This is my 20th year in clinical research. The majority of which was as a CRA. The last several years I've been exploring post-CRA career pathways after having to stop the road warrior life. I've tried the project management route, the clinical operations route, and various other roles within roles but I think my fit is as a CRA mentor/trainer/manager.

I'm currently a CRA Line Manager and support ClinOps. The majority of my career was spent on the CRO side but I've had a couple stops within sponsors. 

In my career I've been on contract twice (prefer W2 employment by far), laid off 2 times, went thru the '08 recession, been thru the COVID boom, been on a PIP and worked out of the PIP, been promoted several times, managed CRAs thru COVID, formally mentored several CRAs long-term, hired CRAs before and after COVID, identified fraud, identified over-employed CRAs, identified fake CRAs, managed rock star CRAs.

I've focused on Oncology pharma for the better part of a decade, but have been in cardiovascular, dabbled in CNS and respiratory, fell in love with clinical research in infectious diseases, then found my passion in hem/onc.

I know several people personally in this sub but would like to keep as anonymous as my main reddit username history will allow.

My tips for being a CRA in a CRO,"Here are some things I wish someone told me earlier as a CRA in a major CRO:
1. Understand site process. If you understand a site‚Äôs workflow, it will be easier to find root causes for issues that may arise and suggest process improvements. 
2. Ask open ended questions and never make accusations. When I see a deviation, I try to present what‚Äôs in the protocol (my expectation) and ask if they can walk me through what happened (and what I‚Äôm seeing in source). 
3. Take good notes. I would recommend making note templates for all your visit types. Write down which ICFs and corresponding versions were reviewed, deviations, SAEs, discussions with PI and SC, departing/new staff. You can refer to these notes later and ideally when you‚Äôre writing a monitoring report you literally copy and paste your notes. 
4. Know who to ask for help. There will be many things you won‚Äôt understand immediately and that‚Äôs okay. Direct yourself to someone who can guide and mentor you. 
5. Introduce yourself always. Making connections and building rapport is an important part of the job. If you‚Äôre on-boarding to a new team, schedule 1:1s with your new team members. Meeting your project manager and ask them about their successes/pain points. When you‚Äôre on site, make sure to remember names and faces and get to know your site staff. People can definitely tell when you‚Äôre not authentic or trying too hard. 
6. Keyboard commands are your friends. My biggest pet peeve as a trainer for new CRAs is watching them fumble between windows. Use alt + tab to seamlessly work between windows. I promise it will save you so much time. 
7. Travel light and have a process for unpacking. Bring work outfits that are wrinkle free. Keep a dirty clothes bag in your suitcase. You will accumulate a lot of things in travel. Make sure you can reset easily when you get home. 
8. Embrace the learning curve. It took me at least six months to even feel comfortable and confident in my monitoring skills. Take every visit and give yourself feedback on how you can do things more efficiently. 
9. Make sure you dedicate time to yourself every time you travel. Work will always be there. Life and experiences will not. You‚Äôre not going to look back on your time as a CRA and relish in all the work you got done. Take yourself out to a nice dinner, art museum, bookstore. Get to know yourself and appreciate opportunities to spend time alone. 
10. Don‚Äôt forget what you came there to do. Joining a CRO grants a lot of opportunities to work in a plethora of indications. Make it clear to your line manager what you‚Äôre interested in and how you can grow into the CRA you want to be. There will be lots of studies thrown at you and before taking on that extra PSV or SIV, think about what you would gain and if it aligns with your goals.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/xq7a3k/my_tips_for_being_a_cra_in_a_cro/,clinicalresearch,0.9194425940513611
Is it me or is ICON getting worse?,"Ive been with ICON as a CRA for a couple of years now and my impression is that the culture of the company and management has gotten worse in the last year or so.

It all started when they changed our bonus structure to more performance based , incentivizing CRAs to do more than 8 DOS to get some semblance of a bonus. Then came the change of our VP, and ever since then a micromanagement of metrics. Everything has to be done perfectly, on-time and with almost zero consideration for the CRAs workload or site responsiveness.  On top of that they want CRAs to do at least 1 SMC per month per site on top of visits EVEN for inactive sites. 

They say its to improve the site inspection readiness but we all know what its about ($$$).  

The major issue im seeing on top of expecting us to do more work, while screwing us on the bonus is that now we are being constantly threatened by management to be perfect. Any slip up in metrics, late report, late training, noncompliance with CTMS2go is a reason for us to have our bonus taken away.

What is happening with this company? Is there anything we can do as CRAs to maybe improve this type of increasingly toxic work culture?

Am I the only CRA who doesn't really care about my studies?,"At every interview, at every job, at every new study presented, CROs present studies as something great.

""Look, it's a Phase I on neuroblastoma, we thought of you because it fits your profile"".

We're asked about the medical field we'd like to work in.

So apparently the therapeutic area would be an important element for some.

&#x200B;

At the same time, I have the impression that many of my colleagues want complicated studies, with a particular design and a super advanced therapeutic area (CarT cell or other).

Others are interested because ""it's potentially a product that will save thousands of people"".

&#x200B;

But I couldn't care less.

I don't care about the therapeutic area. I don't care about the study design. I don't care about the drug.

I don't care if the results of the study are positive or negative. I don't care if the study is cancelled or stopped.

&#x200B;

CROs regularly contact me to ask me to join them, saying ""We only work with major groups like Pfizer, Sanofi, Johnson, ..."".

Is this important to you? Because I don't care about that either

&#x200B;

Give me a simple, easy study, whether it's a hearing aid or a painkiller, whatever.

Even if I have experience, I don't want this double-blind study with multiple phases and treatment arms.

The only thing I want is something simple, easy to manage for the center and to monitor as an CRA with as few AE/SAEs as possible. That's all I want.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/16rz3wa/am_i_the_only_cra_who_doesnt_really_care_about_my/,clinicalresearch,-0.9949055910110474
Has the clinical research environment always been this crazy?,"I became a CRA for a large CRO about 14 months ago, worked for a sponsor in a little bit different type of a role for 4-5 yrs prior to that. I am blown away by the Wild West nature of clinical research

1. Crazy high turnover - I had 6 managers in 14 months. Since the time i got hired, %25 of the CRA onboarding group has left. I get that CRA‚Äôs are revenue generators and by nature will be pushed hard, but wouldn‚Äôt it be better to lower productivity metrics in an effort to increase retention? Half of the CRA‚Äôs I talk to seem like they are on the verge of a mental breakdown. Sites are dealing with a lot of these same issues just replace CRA with CRC.

2. PI oversight - this isn‚Äôt always the PI‚Äôs fault as they can be overworked like everyone else, but most of the time the idea of PI oversight is kindof a joke. The site CRC‚Äôs just tell them where to sign.

3. Vendors setting up sites to fail - have seen a lot of technology issues lately with vendor systems etc that don‚Äôt work how they are supposed to or they are a long ways from being as functional as the vendor promised.

Clinical Research Is Bumming Me Out,"Throw-away account for obvious reasons.

Does anyone else get bummed about the clinical research industry, mainly working with late-stage drug development? I've been in the industry for about a decade, and it's starting to wear on me. The whole system feels so dysfunctional and misguided. I love clinical research and romanticize the importance of advancing health issues, but it's becoming increasingly apparent that bureaucracy and inefficiency have captured the industry.

As a CRA, I meet PI after PI, most just mimicking interest, with half not even able to tell me the protocol number I'm the monitor for. Coordinators are left picking up the slack and being put in precarious situations trying to navigate increasingly demanding and complicated protocols, with little help from sponsors (not always the monitors fault, but often it is), while facing impossible pressures from the mega-SMO their working for to do more with less, all while trying to tip-toe around the fact that their PI is ultimately a figurehead. The protocol deviation log gets longer and longer but those sites will continually be selected because mega-SMOs, CROs, and sponsors have well-machined BD departments that successfully overrule quality concerns.

I've been with several large CROs and sponsors, each plagued by dysfunction, informational disconnect, or misalignment between executives and the front lines. Project managers that go from 0 to 120mph because they didn't correctly communicate milestones or deadlines. SOPs that sometimes are complied with, and SOPs that sometimes are not (but regardless, they will be used against you when things go wrong). More often than not, six or seven different departments are operationalized, and it's impossible to keep track of who's who.

Recently, a clinical lead complimented me on raising issues that previous monitors missed, even going as far as saying they were glad I came on board. During my mid-year review, I asked my manager how to include the kudos, but we couldn't because the system only evaluated based on metrics. There are a lot of bad monitors out there, and a large part is because evaluation and development are insubstantial/misguided, or competent individuals are being asked to do the impossible.

And god help you if you ever come across actual misconduct. The entire system is so disincentivized to follow through that if you come across it, regardless of the traceability of the fraud, you will either be buried under a firestorm of scrutiny and pushback; or removed from the project entirely. True story.

I've loved science my whole life,  loved working in acute clinical care, and clinical research seemed to be the perfect pursuit for me. However, I'm tired of the constant stream of quality issues, and it doesn't seem anyone cares that this work impacts people's lives. I've recently been contemplating a career change, but a part of me still wants to improve things; frankly, I don't know where I would go that wouldn't require starting over.

Does anyone else feel this way? Or am I just being too self-righteous?",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/15alj88/clinical_research_is_bumming_me_out/,clinicalresearch,-0.9986166954040527
Fake CRAs and CTMs in the industry,"Hi Everyone, 

I work in HR for a global pharma company and I've been in the field for around 5 years. One trend that I have seen so much of lately is the exponential rise in fraudulent CRAs and CTMs/CPMs in the industry. As someone who works in HR, we've had people fail background checks since we either can't confirm their previous employment or their education. One major tell we have is they would put on their CV that they are a Senior CRA for a large CRO (Syneos/PPD/Parexel/ICON/IQVIA, etc.) and they have been with that CRO for 5+ years but they would say they are contracted through an ""agency"" - which, when we try to check the legitimacy of this agency, it has no online footprint. Then it would be difficult to confirm whether the agency is real or not. 

I've also heard instances from other HR professionals in the industry of fake CRAs/CTMs hiring other people to interview on their behalf. Most of the time this gets caught (there are various tells during virtual interviews). But sometimes, these fake interviewees do fall through the cracks and get an offer, then the fake CRA/CTM shows up on the first day of work. 

This is very alarming, especially with how important the work of clinical research professionals is and how critical data integrity is relating to clinical trials. It's a very sad trend and also quite frustrating especially for those people who worked hard in their careers while some people fake their entire work history. 

I know for certain that there are already plenty of fake CRAs and CTMs who are currently working in the industry since the background checks/screening and recruitment processes were not as strict years ago as they are now. Most recently our team has had to implement stricter measures to weed out these fraudulent resumes and we continue to monitor the candidate market.

I'd also say to be mindful of referring people to your organization when you have never worked with them before. I have had real CRAs refer fake CRAs (I knew they were fake because they recently failed an employment check for another position we had) and when I asked them if they knew the person, they said no, they were a friend of a colleague. 

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this trend - if you have seen or heard this before? Especially from clinical research folks here who have been part of the hiring process for CRAs/CTMs.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/13n01mb/fake_cras_and_ctms_in_the_industry/,clinicalresearch,-0.9978578686714172

1. **Most asked: You're interested in starting your career in clinical research.** 

Great! I am happy for you. Welcome!

* If you have an Associate's, Bachelor's, Master's, or nursing background, look for entry level positions: **Clinical Research** ***Assistant*** (AKA Assistant Clinical Research Coordinator), **Clinical Trials Coordinator or Clinical Research Coordinator** (AKA Study Coordinator or Site Coordinator), or **Clinical Trials Assistant**
* Positions can be at the site level, sponsor level, or with a CRO. Familiarize yourself with the different types of locations.
* Review Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Indeed, and company websites for open positions.
* Reach out to recruiters for more information and please carefully read the job description.
* You should be trained in ICH-GCP once you are hired, but there are online resources you can use to review the info beforehand

**Edit: I stand corrected.**

~~They are in high demand and difficult to get into but you should have clinical research experience (minimum 1-2 years) before applying to the role. There are entry-level CRA positions (career path) but it is not an entry-level role (for clinical research in general).~~

* ~~How can you know someone is doing something correctly if you, yourself, do not know how to do it? When I was a CRC, I wanted my monitors to have~~ *~~some~~* ~~background in clinical research even if their degree had nothing to do with medicine or science. Even if you think you will quickly grasp the role of CRA, please at least spend a year in an entry level clinical research role. Most companies will not even consider you unless you do.~~

*You can join PPD as a clinical trial coordinator (CTC), remote site monitor (RSM), or country approval specialist (CAS) and advance to the CRA role.*

*...Your credentials should include a* ***registered nursing certification*** *or equivalent and/or relevant formal academic/vocational training; related experience...*

My comment: Seems like nurses can apply for a CRA role at PPD; new grads will need to start as a CTC or other role before advancing to a CRA.

SweetThursday424: ""*...you can be a CRA without working at a site. But make the effort once you get there to understand the flow and challenges your sites have. If you are interviewing for CRA positions, a good guarantee they will ask about working with difficult sites/staff. Understanding why they might be difficult can be helpful.""*

5. **""Do I need X certificate or an advanced degree?""**

Experience beats degrees every time ***unless*** you are going into the Medical Science Liaison (MSL) direction or plan to have another role that would require a medical license. Knowing where you want to end will help you decide what you will need along the way. There are degrees that would be beneficial such as an MBA or MPH. Again, it depends upon your end goal.  A CCRC or CCRP are also nice to have but not required. Get it if you can afford it or your company will pay for it.

Does anyone else feel like CR is unnecessarily stressful and cut throat? ,"I‚Äôm a CRC struggling to keep up with the workload and demands of over five studies across multiple therapeutic areas. It feels like no matter how much work I do, it‚Äôs never enough. When I try to talk to management about feeling overwhelmed, it just results in ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù types of messages. 

I understand the importance of CR and that deadlines, monitoring, DM, queries etc are all part of ensuring quality research. But sometimes it feels unnecessarily and overly stressful and cut throat. A CRA was breathing down my neck about a data entry typo in EDC, and while I understand it was an error on my part, it can be fixed and *no participants were negatively affected*. I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm overworked and overwhelmed, I‚Äôm really doing my best.  

We get tons of emails from sponsors demanding increases in enrollment, but there‚Äôs really nothing CRCs can do if we‚Äôve pre screened every possible patient and they are not eligible or interested. 

TL;DR - I dislike how stressful and cut throat CR is at times. I understand accuracy and quality control are important, but at the end of the day, one EDC data entry error is not fatal. We are humans doing our best and we can only do so much in a day.

Subreddit Updates!,"Hello Everyone!

&#x200B;

I wanted to mention a few things:

1. By popular request, I have found a fairly extensive Clinical Research glossary of terms/abbreviations with definitions (everybody knows how many terms/abbreviations exist in this industry!). You can find it here: [Glossary of Terms](https://glossary.crso.unc.edu/). You can also find it pinned on the Menu Bar next to the Salary Submission Spreadsheet.
2. Posts regarding salary questions (ex. ""How much does a coordinator make at XYZ? I couldn't find them on the spreadsheet"" or ""How much does a CRA at \*insert global CRO\* make?"") will be removed. We have a salary spreadsheet that is public knowledge and also pinned to the Menu Bar. If it is not listed in the Salary Spreadsheet, there is a very high probability that nobody in the community currently knows.
3. Updated subreddit rules to try to reduce the amount of spam and low-effort posts. Apologies in advance if this results in any false-positives. These new rules shouldn't interfere with current community members with positive karma.
4. Updated User Flair and Post Flair

What in the world have I done?,"I had a super mundane WFH job as a quality nurse. I was so bored and isolated, and my skills and brain were slowly festering. I found a great opportunity to work as a Clinical Research Nurse in a nearby Site ( I've been interested for years, loved the idea of clinical skills, science, project management, etc., had applied a few times to various roles, never got a bite). I shadowed and met the team, everyone seemed happy, hours seemed great, they said every now and then a study might ""run over""

I've been here 8 weeks. Holy hell - I have never worked so hard in my life, not even as a bedside nurse. The expectations for productivity are unrealistic, people slack at all hours, my manager sends me messages at 9pm talking business. I could work 60 hours a week and never feel like I'm digging myself out. We are always behind on recruitment and data entry. Working harder only buys me MORE WORK. The song and dance of paperwork for regulatory and GCP all seems made up nonsense to me and just more busy work than is needed. Oh, you don't want to call a subject on Xmas day because the protocol doesn't give you a window? Now you just have to file a protocol deviation for that and spend extra time getting a PI signature to document appropriately?

They are also telling me we are slow right now. If I finally feel like I have a moment to breathe there is another fire that needs to be put out, a sponsor requesting something more, or a deadline that needs to be addressed by EOB.

I feel like I ruined my life. And after being in this sub for a few weeks I feel like this is the worst industry ever - I should have lurked here for a while before making the change. Industry prospects seem low and any future advancement seems to put me in more precarious situation. Compared to the master salary tracker I'm actually making a living wage in this industry compared to most, why would anyone subject themselves to this voluntarily?",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1gglrty/what_in_the_world_have_i_done/,clinicalresearch,-0.9995961785316467
US jobs increased trend towards outsourcing?,"Has anybody else noticed an insane increase in the number of jobs being outsourced overseas? Every CRO boasts hiring but all the rolls are not US based. This is happening in CRO‚Äôs and pharma companies directly. Meanwhile, they take US government assistance and grants for trials which is another topic. They should be penalized instead. The US consumers will also end up paying the most for the successful drugs that hit market. I have already seen the sponsor I work for pissed that teams are moved into different timezones and it delays response times.  They are also poorly trained and struggle to meet deadlines. It further makes the sponsor not want to use them. We have a metric log of CRO performance in terms of forecasting against their actual deliverables. It has caused almost all future trials to move in house. On the flip side, the sponsor is outsourcing jobs in the same way they complain the CROs are doing it. It‚Äôs honestly insane. I see a ripple of regret coming soon. I am sponsor dedicated FSP in finance and see both sides for reference.

I gave up the highest paying job I've ever had,"And likely will ever have. Some backstory: I changes careers about 2 years ago to pursue a career in research. Honestly I chose research because I knew it paid well and thought it would be something I could do. I landed a job as a clinical research coordinator and was so overworked, I hated it. The constant subject visits, pressure to know 10 protocols inside and out, I was miserable so after a while I applied everywhere I thought I could meet enough of the criteria I would be considered. 

Somehow I landed a job at a company making 6 figures and amazing benefits and entirely remote. It was a miracle I got the job and thought it was a dream come true. Problem was, after several months I realized I'm more miserable than I've ever been. I was getting depressed and constantly anxious. I lost sleep over fear of upsetting my boss and speculating on what they think of me. At my performance review I received negative feedback and felt that unless something changed, I might be let go. Hours of overtime and stressing over my work was making me sick. My spouse finally encouraged me to quit and pointed out that I haven't been happy since I left my job at the hospital. I tried sticking it out for a while longer but the constant stress was making me lose weight from not eating and the long hours were keeping me from family time and sleep. I realized I do not like the work and this is not how I want to spend my life or the way I want my children to remember me after they grow up. 

Just by chance, there was an opening at my old job with my old coworker friends. I applied and they happily rehired me the same day. I submitted my resignation and although I feel bad for leaving my team with all the work and for the huge pay cut, I'm so glad to be going back to a job where I was happy.

Edit: Just to clarify, I went back to the job I had before I was a CRC. Research just isn't for me but I am amazed and humbled by the people I got to meet on this journey. I'm sad it didn't work out, but I'm glad I tried and at least know I went for it and gave it my all and left on my own terms.

-no bonuses (or small bonus with songs and dance about how lucky we are to even get the money), 

-High cost healthcare insurance

-unrealistic workload, 

-12-14 hour work days standard 

-no career development

-sink or swim management style 

-professional conferences no longer offered 

-no team building 

-work culture that erodes mental and physical health

She claimed to have a history doing one study that she never refers to, which is fine, whatever, but she co monned for me to help with back log and I watched her click through each page in EDC, verifying the data without cross referencing once. She would simply make sure that there was data entered on the source, look for completion but not accuracy, then verify in edc. I thought maybe I was just being weird so I asked her. At weekly meetings, we are shown pages that were verified at each site during the last visit. She is consistently verifying 700 pages in 4-6 hours. I‚Äôm doing maybe 350 in 6-8? Maybe? So I asked her to show me how she moves so fast, and indeed, she just confirms completion, not accuracy, and thinks verify is the same as review. I escalated this, was asked for proof, there‚Äôs an infamously long single page of data for the visits; takes at least 4 minutes to cross ref data, I asked them to pull up her time marks for opening a page, verify that page, and leaving the page; and it‚Äôs 7ish seconds. Proof she isn‚Äôt reviewing data plus what she told me and what I witnessed. But hey, she‚Äôs rolling out 700 pages so sponsor loves her. This has got to be reported but internally; they do not care and shortly after; removed me from the protocol. What can I do/Should I do something? She‚Äôs on so many projects with so many sites.


Added because maybe relevant: I was part of a massive layoff we had a few weeks ago. I had, quite literally 100% metrics for the last 4 quarters, in EVERYTHING. So even though I know it wasn‚Äôt anything personal, I was offered shitty severance and everything, I am sitting here asking how she wasn‚Äôt let go when her metrics were also awful. So, probably important to acknowledge that there‚Äôs some bitterness on a personal level, but this concern and the desire to escalate was rampant well before i was let go.

Icon Severance and COBRA,"For those in the US getting hit with layoffs:

ICON is being shady. My severance letter says they cover insurance through COBRA for 4 months. That would be the end of July. I was just informed by the insurance company that they‚Äôve cancelled the policy as of April 30. 
HR told myself and the rest of my team that we‚Äôd get paid for unused vacation time. We got none. 

Twice they‚Äôve changed my pay rate with the unemployment office, which automatically terminated my claim each time.

You‚Äôve got to follow up with unemployment, insurance, COBRA, etc. Get the full name and number of everyone you talked to and their direct number. Keep notes about calls. Be very nice to them and they‚Äôll help you. But don‚Äôt trust that ICON did what they said they would, followed up the way they‚Äôre supposed to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/14g6ift/icon_severance_and_cobra/,clinicalresearch,-0.9993324875831604

Advice to new CRAs,"Howdy! I've seen a lot of posts from new CRAs and people who are entering the field; mostly interview coaching and also some basics of how to get in.  In the event it's helpful, I wanted to share some experience that you can take if it makes sense, and ignore if it doesn't. None of this is in any order.....

* You're entering a field that requires a lot of time, effort and attention. It's hard work and there's plenty of it and it's important that it's done correctly. Monitors and site staff ARE the Study - the rest of us in RA, DM, PM, MW, etc just support you. It's important you know this: it's like you're a paramedic or a banker where you WILL be under pressure and WILL have to perform. If that sounds like a challenge, you're moving in the right direction - if it sounds like Hell, then turn and run.

* No matter what happens in your career, the most important thing at the end of the day is subject safety. Think of every subject like your grandmother or beloved child.

* Have ways that you manage incoming and ongoing work. Or, know how to triage and act on priorities. 

* Do NOT allow others to pull you down into their drama. You'll need to be relentless to remain outside of this but it pays dividends. ""DM just doesn't get this"" and ""the sites are stupid and can't get this simple fact"" and ""this or that PI is a jerk, arrogant, stupid"" -- all of that. None of it is helpful to the work moving forward or more importantly, to your peace of mind. Treat yourself better than that. Stay above it.

* Think about the work you want to do and when you interview for a position, ask about these things. Research them - connect w people who work there, Google, etc. Otherwise you say yes, get hired and might hate it. That sucks so be clear w you on what you want and create that versus just trying to get hired.

* Practice your interview until you can do it cold. You're smart - look up the most common interview questions and practice ALOUD answering them. You wouldn't wing it if you were giving a speech - why would you wing an interview. 

* In your interview, never ever ever talk shit about anyone. If you're leaving you current employer because management sucks, then say something about having topped out in your role and seeking out new experiences, approaches to problem solving - whatever. I mean, don't lie but look for a way to kindly say you're leaving a sinking ship w/out saying it outright. 

* Always present yourself from a position of confidence.

* Learn how to get your CV past the ATS mechanisms

* Get on LinkedIn and leverage it as a networking tool. Forget the posts in the newsfeed and focus on employers, search for ""*employer name* recruiter"" and connect. Start connecting with people unapologetically - it's what the apparatus is for and it pays in jobs!

* Hopefully this is true and not an act but show me in the interview that you understand the work, are anxious to learn what you don't understand, and are accountable and professional. 

* Don't fall for the trap that working excessively is success. Yes it is hard work but that doesn't mean you have to sell your soul to hustle culture. If that's what you want, then for sure - go full steam ahead. I just think it's a recipe for resentment and burnout.

* Remind yourself that everyone really is doing their best. Even if they could do better on a different day, even if they lose their cool, don't keep a commitment, etc., you don't know what else they're dealing with. Give people the benefit of the doubt and help when you can versus being critical. That isn't the same as carrying someone who isn't showing up and pulling their weight.

* For the love of all that is holy and sacred to you, please escalate issues through the proper channels. (1) Surprises in research are a hassle, (2) many big fires can be prevented with a simple escalation.

* Know your SOPs, the Protocol(s) and all Plans so well that you could teach them. This will make so much of your job easier and save me and others from having to say, ""per the SOP section blah blah blah, do this and that"". We have so much documentation these days it's almost ridiculous but so what? Has to be done. :)

Shout out to my first site...,"... they taught me well. They brought me in from nothing (newly licensed phlebotomist who just signed up to the right Facebook group, literally). They taught me the right way to do so many things and showed me the ""why""s and the ""how""s.

I am a fast learner and independently able to progress faster than expected in most situations, but they fostered an environment where I could learn not only from them, but also from doing it all myself with them just at the right distance.

Within 2 months I was creating source from scratch, within 4 months I was lead coordinator on 2 studies. Was it scary? Very much so! But was it the right way for me to advance? Definitely! 

They knew from day 1 that I wanted to be a CRA (not knowing what beyond there I would be interested in...) and they still encouraged me at every turn. I left them right before 2 years to be a CTA at a CRO- on a path to CRA.

I have a great foundation from my first site and I can see how much other people have missed out on the same opportunities, I hate that for them.

Syneos interwiev,"So funny story...I was approached by syneos recruiter in June, saying they have an open position that fits my resume. I wasn't looking for a new job, but I did the interviews out of curiosity. I did two rounds of interviews, one with recruiter and one with manager, all fine, we agree on salary expectations, all great. And third interview was supposed to be with the sponsor, and I was waiting for them to notify me about this, three months has passed since then. 

Now we are coming to the fun part, I was approached again by syneos recruiter for the same role. They forgot they already did interviews with me, hahaha, how can you be so superficial at your job. 

Now I meet again with the manager, oh, the salary they are offering now is lower, he cannot clearly define the ""benefits"" they are mentioning. All process was so clumsy, to say the least.

I would accept rejection, as well, they could have comunicated that, I didnt plan to change jobs in the first place.

It seems, they decided not to say anything, but the recruiter fucked up and aproached me again.

I knew I didnt want to go to syneos before all this, now they just confirmed what a scam of a cro they are.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1f9t3kd/syneos_interwiev/,clinicalresearch,-0.9978289008140564

ICON Probable teams to be affected.,"This is from the investor slide deck which is publicly available and anyone can read .

‚ÄúCEO, Dr. Steve Cutler commented, ‚ÄúICON‚Äôs results for the third quarter did not meet the expectations we had previously provided
due to specific customer and division-level impacts. 

Our revenue shortfall was attributable to more material headwinds from **two large customers undergoing budget cuts** and changes in their development model, lower than anticipated **vaccine-related activity,**
and ongoing cautiousness from **biotech customers ** resulting in award and study delays.

We expect these impacts to continue into quarter four, and as a result, we are taking decisive action to realign our resources to
forecasted activity. 

With these actions, we are updating our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to between $13.90 and $14.10, representing year over year growth of 8.7% to 10.2%.

===========================
It‚Äôs really interesting there is still year over year growth and yet mass layoffs and outsourcing . Which didn‚Äôt really yield the success in the material headwinds the way the executives surely imagined .

Vaccine related studies and biotech are definitively going to see layoffs because of executive teams incompetence ",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1gb5bnr/icon_probable_teams_to_be_affected/,clinicalresearch,-0.9982605576515198

Layoffs at Emmes Group....again,"After being promised there were not likely to be any additional layoffs following the massive RIF in January 2024, leadership has been quietly and consistently trimming and laying off in small numbers ever since. They made a big move yesterday by canning the entirety of the US TMF department along with at least 15 other people across a wide range of departments (numbers still rolling in as this is all being swept under the rug).

This comes a day after they closed their ""anonymous"" employee survey, and a 2 weeks after C-suite team touted the merits and need of the TMF department. CEO even sent a beautiful AI generated email reinforcing the need to reinforce TMF. So lets fire the whole US team and send the work overseas to the group with multiple complaints from auditors and coworkers and who are OOO because its a national holiday when studies and sponsors are still in a lurch over losing their dedicated staff.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1fulpc6/layoffs_at_emmes_groupagain/,clinicalresearch,-0.9578858613967896
Medfart Corruption Rant ,"Ladies and gentlemen, let me tell you about a company that truly knows how to put the ""suck"" in ""sucks to be you."" I'm talking about Medfart. If you've ever wanted to experience what it's like to be trapped in a job that's not just a career but a full-on prison sentence, then Medfart's got you covered.

You walk into that place, and it's like entering a concentration camp with bad benefits. The only reason nobody's sprinting for the exit is because the job market right now is as bleak as a Monday morning after a three-day bender. If you're thinking of leaving, good luck‚ÄîMedfart's got you locked in tighter than a maximum-security facility.

Let's talk pay‚ÄîMedfart is like a cruel joke where everyone else in the industry is laughing all the way to the bank while you're left scraping together pennies. If you think you're getting the same deal as your peers, think again. They‚Äôre probably still laughing at the offers they turn down while you're stuck making half of what you should be.

And let‚Äôs not forget the badge-in, badge-out system. It's not security‚Äîit's a daily reminder that you‚Äôre essentially a prisoner. That little ritual is Medfart‚Äôs way of making you feel like you‚Äôre in a high-security compound rather than a place where people are supposed to do productive work.

And August Turdhole, the CEO, oh boy. August, it's time to wake up and get a grip. If you had any idea what was going on in your own company, you'd know it's not a business‚Äîit's a cautionary tale. But keep on dreaming, August. Maybe one day you'll realize that running a company like a prison isn't the way to keep your employees from escaping.

Finally let‚Äôs not overlook the blatant corruption at Medfart, where August Turdhole has turned nepotism into an art form. His entire family has been parachuted into cushy roles within the company like they're on some sort of corporate holiday. His son owns Element Fartery, which just so happens to be the only place employees are allowed to eat if they want to stay within the prison's walls. The real kicker? Medfart's insistence on getting everyone back in the office isn't about productivity‚Äîit's a ploy to line Turdhole Jr.'s pockets. It‚Äôs a sickening scheme where the family cashes in on every meal you eat and every hour you work, proving that the only thing more corrupt than the pay is the entire setup.

So if you‚Äôre working at Medfart, just remember: the only thing more captive than your career is your stomach, because August Turdhole's family is serving up the only food you can afford.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1eyuoeq/medfart_corruption_rant/,clinicalresearch,-0.9978138208389282

This man who works in HR was tasked with posting ""ghost jobs"" at his company, and he said he has posted about 300 before his conscience bothered him and he just couldn't do it anymore.

This guy said his friend also works in HR at another company, and they post ghost jobs too, as do many companies.

Finally Broke Through!,"Hello!

I know there have been a LOT of people looking for CRA positions and I was one of them (CRC looking for CRA role).

I ended up really sprucing up my LinkedIn profile and including a lot of my current and previous job tasks. I then opted for the ""Premium LinkedIn"" free trial. It was only one month free but I did notice more people reaching out to me. Basically, any recruiter that wanted to connect, I said, ""yes"".

I will not go into details of my disability. It changes nothing, and if you think it does, there's many search engines and advocates out there to help ya out, I'm not in the mood to educate you.

I was basically forced into short term disability due to their lack of compliance with ADA and their terrible accommodation process. Then I was forced onto unpaid ADA leave, again for the same reasons. *I was able to work, but they refused to let me because it would require me to work from home.* I was already hybrid.......

When the leave ended, I was still fighting for my rights. They continued to refuse ADA accommodations, saying I could just move to different conference rooms and wellness rooms all day long. Ah, yes, let me bring all three of my screens to every single room I go to! (Funny, when I said this doesn't even make sense and would cause my days to be incredibly long trying to move myself, my medical bag, and my work equipment all the time, the HR lady was like ""what's so hard about picking up your laptop?"" well, girl, maybe get a job where you actually work and you might figure it out.) Don't even get me started on the work/life balance issue I brought up, too.

I did get the HR lady to admit that in-office work (and I quote directly from the email, because of course I saved them) ""is valuable for collaboration and further training for yourself and colleagues in the department and we believe we can accommodate your needs while continuing an in-office presence."" So that was their reason for denying. Per EEOC, ""An employer should not, however, deny a request to work at home as a reasonable accommodation solely because a job involves some contact and coordination with other employees. Frequently, meeting can be conducted effectively by telephone and information can be exchanged quickly through e-mail."" (quoted directly from the EEOC website regarding telework reasonable accommodations.). And clearly they couldn't accommodate my needs.

Her response to this was simply telling me that she did not have to provide the accommodation I asked for, despite me explaining very clearly why the accommodations they suggest are not effective. No other suggestions. Nothing. Zero accommodations. No more interactive process.

Dear Medpace, legally you do not need to provide the accommodations asked, but you DO need to provide effective (not perfect, but effective) accommodations, and you even refused that.

As I told them, you would not give an accommodation of a room for someone to have a seizure in, you would accommodate to make sure they are less likely to have that seizure. My disability needs to be treated the exact same.

Next day I resigned immediately because I could not use work from home and I feared for my life. I decided my life was more important than money, more important than ever being employed by them again, and more important than getting the PTO that I saved for my November vacation paid out. Medpace decided control was more important than my life. And they have made it very clear recently that control is more important than any of their employees' lives.

Do not tell me to sue them. Unfortunately, MANY companies discriminate against disabled people. ADA is not really enforced, and it's really unfortunate when you figure that out while in the midst of a health crisis and discrimination. I do not have the resources or connections to pay for lawyers and going through the EEOC will take YEARS to even get my case looked at. I would rather be loud online and save at least one person from working there than to ruin my health and life more in order to make them pay a little fee. And last time I checked, AJT was ""flush with cash"" so. (lol)

No accommodation that will benefit a disabled person would harm an abled person. In fact, most abled people will actually benefit. Work from home, grocery pick up. Both incredible accommodations that parents, busy people, lazy people, etc. ALSO benefit from, and those are two things that have completely changed my life. I would be dead without them. I am not exaggerating.

It's ok, though, I am finally improving my health and I was already working on a Master's degree and learning skills that I know Medpace wants. They want bots? ""Ah yes, let's run out the data person studying machine learning and AI. Perfect."" More time for me to learn and do projects. üòò",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1g9t4bx/discrimination_at_medpace/,clinicalresearch,-0.9988231062889099

"Those of you who have been in the industry 10 yrs+, have things ever been this bad?","Seems like things in the CR space are doom and gloom. Everyone from CRAs, Line Managers and Project Managers have been laid off. Many companies are on hiring freezes or/and halting their CRA training programs. And if you‚Äôre lucky enough to land a job the salary is often lower than expected. 

Many CROs AND Sponsor companies have done mass layoffs: Pfizer, Moderna, Genentech, Syneos, ICON, and reportedly PPD is next to eliminate jobs etc.

Feedback for those trying to get into the industry...,"I've been in the industry for the last 11 years (straight out of college), worked in various roles in 3 CROs,  and currently work for one of the big guys.  

I only recently discovered this subreddit and made an innocent post a couple days ago (under different account) offering to help someone get into the industry by reviewing their CV....

I had over 40(!) people reach out to me directly on this within 24 hours. Majority were younger folks coming out of undergrad or grad school. Best of intentions but it floored me the sheer volume of folks trying to make it ""in"". Based on a dozen of follow up interactions, I have some feedback and suggestions for those who may find value:

1. Simplicity is key with CVs. Please, no crazy templates or flowers or animations. Professionalism is key (especially if you're younger). You got flowers on your CV? Nobody will read it.

2. Get a LinkedIn profile. 

3.  Network isn't just a buzzword. In this competitive environment you are up against very experienced folks. Referrals are huge and you can't just say ""here is my cv, I'd like a job"". You want a CRA role? Find a CRA based in your town and reach out to offer to buy them coffee and learn more about their role and how they got where they are. DO NOT ASK for a job in this engagement, simply build your brand and be a sponge. You do this enough, someone will connect the dots for you in a meaningful way for a future role. Plus, you'll meet some sweet folks. I did this and still keep in touch with those folks. 

4. Similar to point 2 AND 3...use LinkedIn to your advantage for digital networking. You savvy social media Gen z folks should be able to crush this. 

5. Be PATIENT. Hardest part is getting into the industry in ANY capacity. If you get entry level making less than you want....take it. Then crush it. You'll see benefits down the line. Instant gratification doesn't exist in this industry. 

6. Lastly, the industry is MUCH SMALLER than you think. Do not burn bridges and be sure to throw wide nets. You never know what can happen down the line. 

7. You. Can. Do. This. Just be more persistent and focused than your ""competition"" and it'll pay off.  

Best of luck aspiring CRO folk!",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1102jb2/feedback_for_those_trying_to_get_into_the_industry/,clinicalresearch,-0.6364803910255432

Unpopular Opinion: CRAs don‚Äôt get paid enough,"This is a post about CRAs. Not CRCs, CTAs or anyone who will moan about me being ungrateful for my pay.

Vent: Last night, my flight coming home from a monitoring visit got cancelled after being delayed 2.5 hours. I wait in line for a hotel voucher. The hotel voucher they give me is for a 2 star hotel. I barely get any sleep because I feel so uncomfortable in the room. It was so shoddy. 

Im on the phone with Concur to book the first morning flight out at 8 am. It‚Äôs a 3 hr flight. I‚Äôm stuck in a middle seat because that‚Äôs all Concur could get for me last minute. I‚Äôm uncomfortable and my back hurts. 

It‚Äôs a 45 minute drive back from the airport. I come home to 10 emails from my CTM marked as ‚Äúhigh priority ‚Äú, some veeva quality issues emails to fix, report revisions to get done. I‚Äôm so tired. My body hurts.

I tell myself I‚Äôll take a nap and hit the ground running when I wake up because on top of these emails I have 2 reports to write. I have to follow up with a vendor about some issues from my MV. I wake up 5 hours later lol. 

I‚Äôm thankful for my paycheck but the amount of work and documentation I am expected to keep up with is a lot. Plus the sponsor is very picky about filing and has absurd deadlines. They expect us Yo go through Veeva weekly while also being on site. 
I wish I had in-house help. I wish I could just do my visits and reports and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs all the extra stuff that‚Äôs weighing heavy on me. How am I supposed to get any work done when I‚Äôm getting flights cancelled or delayed. This is not the first time this has happened obviously but I was extra annoyed today .
I wish my CRO paid for airport lounge access so at least I‚Äôd have a quiet place to work. It‚Äôs not even like I can get work done on the plane because economy is so cramped and the only airline they pay for that offers free in flight Wi-Fi is Delta and they‚Äôre not always the most ‚Äúcost-effective‚Äù.

My theory on Syneos going private,"I actually think this will be good for the company. Mainly because Michelle Keefe is no longer CEO and Colin has taken over. Honestly, if you look at Michelle‚Äôs background she should have never been CEO much less CEO of a CRO. 

Colin is much more suited to understanding how to run a successful CRO. He was former CEO of PRA for like 15 years (who everyone knows was one of the best CROs around) and was C-suite at PPD. 

PPD CRAs seemed to be the happiest (don‚Äôt know how things have changed since being acquired by TF though) out of all the major CROs from what I remember when I worked on site. IIRC they didn‚Äôt do DOS but you just had to stay billable at least 95%‚Ä¶?

Syneos has potential to be greater than it is. It‚Äôs not as large as IQVIA or ICON but I think that‚Äôs a strength. The problem today is that CROs overpromise and under delivery. Way too focused on metrics vs quality and as a result hire unqualified people who don‚Äôt care about doing a good job and focused on checking boxes.

Syneos has won a lot of industry rewards recently so the talent is there. They should focus on quality, attracting and  KEEPING top performers versus trying to expand largely at this moment. 

I don‚Äôt think going private is the death of a company as some people do. Parexel is private and everyone I know who works there has been working there for awhile and enjoys working there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/16yvngp/my_theory_on_syneos_going_private/,clinicalresearch,0.529778242111206

Rant: Do data managers get paid/get bonuses/bill sponsors per query?,"I am sorry, but I just can‚Äôt seem to find any other explanations for some of the queries I get as a site.

I see a lot of feedback from CRCs & CRAs venting frustrations and stresses. Any PMs out there that just want to let it all out?,"CRO PM here - I noticed the majority of posts venting are from CRCs and CRAs. I see you and I hear you. I try my best not to be that source of angst on my projects. 

But got me thinking, especially given the current industry landscape which is‚Ä¶unique. Are there any PMs or Directors out there that want to sow their sorrows and get it all off your chests?

Myself:

1) fuck scope management and financial forecasting - boring as all hell, a throw in the dark at best, and always used against you. Not to mention I have zero financial background or training but suddenly I‚Äôm an accountant 

2) love being on the phone for half the day, sometimes more. So damn exhausting

3) so many questions from every single direction, with most around readily available/documented info. The decision fatigue is real and Teams will be the death of me

4) timelines ü§Æ, I get it. I get the purpose they serve and there‚Äôs really no good alternative, but man plans and god laughs. 

5) unwinding all the vendor nuances, whether it‚Äôs proprietary systems, specs, or budgets. Can we please stop with the cute meaningless jargon? Idk wtf they talk about half the time. Don‚Äôt expect me to understand your goofy terminology or processes, if you‚Äôre barred from sharing them directly 

6) CROs, no one cares about your profitability, not us little guys. I sure as hell won‚Äôt see any of it so there is no incentive for me to bust my ass so you can watch a green line go up. Just make sure my direct deposit hits. It‚Äôs also gross to tout how righteous our work is when your business model is to squeeze as much money out of a contract, for better or worse.

7) Sponsors, literally relax. The sites and CRO team ARE overworked. That is the simple reality but they‚Äôll never tell you that out of principle. We do laugh at you when you freak out when something inevitably goes awry. Your protocol just sucks. 5 YOE and I can read your protocol once and tell you if it will be a shit show or not. I‚Äôm genuinely dumbfounded when ‚Äúexperts‚Äù with +20 YOE can‚Äôt see that. 

8) Some of the new therapeutics and technology IS cool, the overwhelming majority is not. Especially in my function, clinical research is not interesting when all I do is paperwork, take calls, and push buttons on a computer. Actually it‚Äôs quite insufferable

9) it‚Äôs alarming how shady some research sites are and it‚Äôs only gotten worse, I‚Äôll leave it at that

10) in drug development, the rules and regulations only apply when it suits the objective. Only those truly brazen or careless enough to challenge the system will get punished, but most get away with a level of delinquency. Applies to all parties

I hate my job.,"I (26 F) have been working as a Clinical Research Associate I for nearly 2 years now. I have a bachelor‚Äôs and master‚Äôs in biological sciences and so it made sense at the time to go into this field.

As time has gone on, I realize I absolutely despise this work. I sit in front of a computer managing data for my entire shift with barely any interaction with anyone. In my previous job, I was a Medical Assistant and I loved it purely due to the social interaction and fulfillment I felt in my job.

The only good part of my job was that I could work from home 4 out of 5 days of the week. However, because of recents mistakes I made in a monitor visit, I have been called into the office full-time. I am genuinely about to lose it.

This job is 45 minutes from my home with traffic. I even moved closer to this job last year and had to move back to my family home because I couldn‚Äôt afford my bills due to my low take-home. The snow hasn‚Äôt even started so it‚Äôs just going to get worse. Plus, I have to pay $40 per week for parking! And lastly, I genuinely don‚Äôt even feel like I‚Äôm good at my job. I am constantly called out for mistakes despite trying my best and I feel defeated.

I‚Äôm going to school part-time to earn my MSW (which is what I always wanted to do but was influenced otherwise by family pressure) so eventually I won‚Äôt be in this field in a few years. For now, I don‚Äôt even know where else to apply. Am I overreacting? What do I do? Any and all advice is appreciated.

MD or RN omitted something from the source note before I was hired? Previous CRC whom I inherited the study from made a data entry error in EDC one year ago? I get blamed. 

Lab kits delivered to wrong building at the hospital? Sponsor blames me for not locating them sooner. 

Imaging department doesn‚Äôt follow-up with unreachable patient after three attempts to schedule baseline MRI? PI blames me for not enrolling the patient yesterday.

Patient comes out of window because of their own travel schedule, even though we offered several dates in-window? I get blamed for the PD.

The workload is heavy. The stress is high. The pay is low. The morale is low. I feel like I am drowning. 

Can other CRCs relate?

Got a job offer I feel unqualified for,"Hi guys

Especially since I have never worked on the pharmaceutical side of things. I was very honest about my experience, so it‚Äôs not like I misled them into thinking I was so experienced.

A thank you to this community,"As someone who has spent the past 15+ years in clinical research in a variety of roles, I just want to say thank you to my colleagues. 

Clinical research has never been more on display than ever before with the development of the COVID-19 vaccines. I enrolled in a trial and found the experience to be incredibly valuable. I received placebo so tonight I received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine. 

I‚Äôve heard from countless people about long work weeks, blowing start up cycle times out of the water, recruitment goals that were insane, etc. There has been praise for the preclinical scientists and the companies, but maybe not enough for the countless professionals who worked on these trials. There has been negativity and hesitancy from the public.

From a site to those on the CRO/sponsor side: are you guys doing OK?,"And I mean that genuinely. As site management at a very large CAN hospital oncology program, I interact with a ton of you wonderful people on a daily basis overseeing our programs new trial start up and ongoing activities. Many of whom I‚Äôve had multi year and multi trial relationships with. But I‚Äôve noticed these last 4-6 months have had a large uptick in chaotic interactions with the CROs primarily but also the sponsors. Frantic rushes to push activation tasks through followed by radio silence for weeks on end happening a lot more often than normal. Sudden trial terminations mid-start up. CRO/sponsor staff that I communicated with on a Friday suddenly gone on a Monday with no coverage leaving some tasks at a standstill. And in the more recent months certainly an increase in borderline harassing emails (mostly from CROs so far) demanding immediate prioritization of their trial and cc‚Äôing every contact they could find in the process despite having timelines laid out at PSSVs. 

I know this industry has faced a number of layoffs due to missed earnings targets and huge covid staff expansions, and that shit always trickles down, but if this is what we‚Äôre noticing on the site side I can only imagine what you all are going through on your side.

SOCRA CCRP Exam,"Just passed CCRP exam and thought I‚Äôd drop a few pointers for studying:

There are ZERO questions that even reference specific sub parts so, despite all the Brainscape and quizlet cards testing your knowledge of ‚Äòwhat is 21CFR50 sub part B‚Äô- your time is MUCH better spent on other things. The exam literally only goes as far as saying ‚Äòper CFR‚Äô on questions. 

As other posts mentioned - HEAVY on reporting windows and duties of sponsors vs. investigator. I started a deck of study cards in Brainscape with the all reporting windows and timeframes for SAE/AE‚Äôs- it helped tremendously, and they should be available to all by searching ‚ÄòSOCRA CCRP reporting & timelines‚Äô. Know your procedures for reporting unexpected AE/ADR/SAEs well. 

I studied Belmont/Helsinki/Nuremberg too much - there was literally one question about all three. Again - spend time studying elsewhere. 

I have 8 years in clinical research experience and started studying about two weeks ago.  Honestly, most questions I answered from experience, rather from study material recall. 

If you‚Äôre in the field you‚Äôll do fine!

Also: record retention: 2 years unless it‚Äôs IRB which is 3. They asked this, reworded, about 10 times. Also FDF updated for 1 year following completion (asked multiple times)",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/usof99/socra_ccrp_exam/,clinicalresearch,-0.5244559645652771

I think I don't like my in-house CRA job anymore,"I used to be so motivated and determined that I'd keep working hard as in-house CRA and then later on become an onsite CRA, but suddenly I've completely lost my excitement and motivation. I have the feeling that I'm just sending and replying to emails, filling in trackers, and dealing with logistic stuff all day. I feel completely useless and I didn't expect this at all. The onsite CRA position might be more fun, but I expect it to be the same kind of work + SDV + more face2face contact and site training. Even that doesn't sound appealing anymore. For some reason thinking about all of this has made me physically exhausted and I don't recognize myself anymore. I usually get through the week on autopilot, while right now I feel like I have zero energy. I like my company and the people but what I'm doing doesn't feel inspiring or energizing in any way.
I'm just wondering if anyone has ever experienced something similar and how they've dealt with it. I'm not sure how to handle this situation. It's crazy to feel burnt out while I'm not even overworked. Maybe this is not the right job for me and I'm only finding out now.

Just took the SOCRA exam for the first time and passed! üéä Here are some of my suggestions to those preparing for the exam (Jan 2022),"Hi all!

Took the computer-based test this afternoon and passed! ü•≥ I was initially worried that I would have to retake it again as I did not prepare for it as thoroughly as I would have liked to. My preparation included reading through the official guide and some PowerPoint slides I found online. I have 5 years of CR experience at an academic site working with many sponsors, which I think helped tremendously. Anyways, I wanted to share some suggestions to those preparing for the exam soon.

1. Be very familiar with document retention (for the site and sponsor) for the different kinds of studies (phase I, II, III, etc) in specific contexts (market approval, study termination, etc). There were SEVERAL questions about this.

2. Know your reporting guidelines!!! Who does a site need to report an SAE to if it‚Äôs expected per the IB? How soon does the site or sponsor need to report the serious event? Who is the event reported to? Similar to #1, there were several questions about the who/when/to whom regarding expedited reporting.

3. Know investigator versus sponsor responsibilities! I don‚Äôt think I chose any answer as ‚Äúcontract research organization/CRO‚Äù as the ultimate responsibility usually falls on the sponsor or investigator depending on the context.

4. Obviously, be familiar with all CFR regulations. I did NOT memorize the sub parts and all those numerical details. I DID focus on general themes of each CFR part commonly referred to. It is also helpful to know how CFR guidelines differ or are similar to ICH guidelines.

5. This is not about the actual content, but I found it helpful to use the scratch paper provided to write the answer choices for the questions I struggled with. In that way I could cross off the answers I KNEW were wrong, but could come back to later. The actual test does NOT have an option to highlight or cross our answer choices on the computer.

6. Edited to add that this is the website I used to access some powerpoint presentations from UC Irvine. I focused on the last 5 documents that start with ""crcsess..."" https://icts.uci.edu/crc/socra-training/

That‚Äôs all I can think of that really stood out. Let me know if you have any questions and good luck!",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/sfvgd2/just_took_the_socra_exam_for_the_first_time_and/,clinicalresearch,-0.9877838492393494

> Auto rejection systems from HR make me angry. I‚Äôm a tech lead and for 3 months HR wasn‚Äôt able to find a single person for the position we‚Äôre looking. I‚Äôve created myself a new email and sent them a modified version of my CV with a fake name to see what was going on with the process and guess, I got auto rejected. HR didn‚Äôt even look at my CV. I took this up to management and they fired half of the HR department in the following weeks, the issue was they were looking for an angularjs developer while we were looking for an Angular one (different frameworks, similar names), this kind of silly mistakes must and can be fixed in minutes, and since the CVs were auto rejecting profiles without angularjs in it we literally lost all possible candidates. The truly infuriating part was that I consistently talked to them asking for progress and they always told me that they had some candidates that didn‚Äôt pass the first screening processes (which was false).

Stay humble,"Disclaimer: I have no intention to roast anyone. I am mainly interested in seeing if other experienced CRAs are feeling the same way or if it is just me or the company I am at just happens to favor all these snobbish CRAs. 

I am an experienced CRA and I think I deserve my senior title after being in this role for at least 5 years and having accumulated hundreds of visits of all types. I had the opportunity of monitoring with some CRA 1s and 2s lately and it dissolves my desire to become a mentor. I am not sure why all these junior CRAs are so full of themselves and would get defensive the moment I raise a comment or question. For example, whenever one of them asked me a question, they always had to stress that they know all these other stuff and just not this one thing that they are asking. Who cares??? I am not even there to judge them or do any assessment. I understand that all CRAs have to start somewhere. When I was a newbie, I wish I had the chance to co-monitor with seasoned CRAs more and I am grateful for every single piece of advice I was given along the way. I get that some of them could have worked as CRCs and probably know more about clinical research than back when I first started. It is great that they are able to get on track with monitoring quickly, but still, they should not dismiss other people's experience or background. This is a field that is constantly changing. I kept telling everyone that I am still learning new stuff everyday even after all these years. And this is what gets me excited about this job.

Buckle the fuck up,"Hey colleagues. I read a lot of questions here seeking advice on how to jump over positions and into trial management as a clinical lead or project lead and I want to beg you to please stop doing so because I get stuck managing trials with grossly overworked staff.

I won't do that, though. You manage your career for you and I get that. For those who don't know already, since the Great Resignation, COVID and other factors where businesses are restructuring to remain profitable during these events, working at a CRO is not easy. Working in clinical research is not easy. 

Management is most certainly not easy. I've had so much turn over in staff leads, it's ridiculous; I wind up driving teams in addition to the work I have to do as part of my job. Many, and I mean MANY individuals in individual contributor roles as well as management roles, don't know how to do their jobs. 

""Teaching"" them falls to guess who. Gone are the days of trusting a forecast provided to me, believing someone actually will deliver something on a date they commit to. Partly because they're overworked, overcommitted and partly because they leap-frogged over roles and have no idea how. Even when I spoon feed the information to them.

I love the work I do. I don't mind hard work I think because I am from a certain generation where we didn't stand up for ourselves like the new generation does. I don't know. I applaud people who say, ""No more."" and split. That isn't me though - I, and many like me are left to keep a trial running with quality and compliance when it has 70% of its staff.

I really try and stay out of other people's business so please take this with a grain of salt and of course, do what makes sense for you. Just know that it isn't an easy job, that you ARE going to have to fill in for others, put in long hours and if you work for me, I will never ever EVER throw you under the bus but I will 100% hold you accountable to your role and your commitments.

Research Experience > Advanced Degree,"Tough one for many to hear after going through all that schooling, being in serious debt, feeling really accomplished. I really do get it. 

The thing about it is, you should be proud of yourself. It‚Äôs an incredible achievement and should be celebrated. 

However, it does not get you into advanced positions easily. It does not always allow you to jump the line. More and more companies have come to realize that experience matters way more than a degree. 

What it does allow you to do is make sure you do not have a ceiling once in. It also will get you hired over someone with less than a year exp or equal to you. Sometimes a faster pace to those advanced positions is allowed as well. There are definitely roles that require having a masters degree. Masters degrees in research today are used in the future. At least that‚Äôs what I have seen out there. Start applying for entry level and gain experience.

That being said, this industry is suffering hard from what some CROs did with the position. I understand that everyone wants more money and they are entitled to get the best possible salary they can. However, the job hopping for salary increase or sign on bonus stuff has caused a ton of layoffs from most large CROs. The sponsors are really getting sick of paying a ton of money for ‚Äúlite‚Äù services. Now there are a ton of CRAs looking for work with little travel and big money. It‚Äôs a CRO special to throw money out to them and not care about their future or work/ life balance. Not a long term thing, not a stable thing, and definitely not a great thing for our industry. It‚Äôs also turned the CRA position from something that was universally respected into a money grab. I hope there a way to get back on track and bring back the real aspirations of becoming a monitor.

What are some things you have heard people say that opened up a can of worms without them realizing it? ,"Over the course of my career in clinical research, as both a CRC and a CRA, I‚Äôve had many instances where someone made a comment that they clearly felt was inconsequential or a good answer to a question, but it actually made me cringe because it just opened up a can of worms or was a red flag. 

One that comes to mind that I‚Äôve heard multiple times (and read in Warning Letters) is when PIs are asked questions about how they ensure quality at their site, or they‚Äôre asked to explain how certain issues happened, and their only response is, in essence, ‚Äúwe rely solely on the CRA/monitor to catch things‚Äù. 

Another common one is when people cite being overwhelmed/not having enough time as the reason they haven‚Äôt been able to complete important tasks (like EDC entry). Especially when it‚Äôs a long term thing and not due to a short term event (like someone being on PTO or recent turnover).

Advice for job seekers,"I keep seeing daily posts on asking about jobs in the industry, and in general they are all very similar. If you have been successful in getting a new position lately, feel free to drop what worked for you in the comments. If you disagree, speak up and tell me I'm wrong. 

  
**I'm a \_\_\_\_\_ and I want a job in clinical research:**

* New grad/going to graduate soon: Congrats! Welcome to the ""real world"" and navigating the minefield that is finding your first full-time job. If you are still in school and interested in clinical research there are a couple of options to get exposure to the industry now. Depending on where you live and go to school, look at your school's medical school (if they have one) or local hospital systems to see if they are engaged in clinical research. If they are chances are they may hire for part-time research assistants. This might be boring work- copying and scanning, labeling tubes, filing, organizing. However, this is a good way to network and see if research might be a fit. Local research sites may be willing to hire as well, but be aware that these are going to be entry-level minimum wage positions. If you live in an area where there are biotech/pharma/CRO companies they have internships. 
* Healthcare worker: I'm not a nurse but have plenty of friends who are and realize the being at the bedside is hard. So kudos to you. There are a couple of options- depending on what type of nurse you are (LPN, RN, NP) you have more options. Some nurses move into safety/pharmacovigilance, some stay at the site level and work as coordinators, some move into CROs/sponsors and there are a variety of roles. Here's the sticking point...you need a 4 year degree for many of these positions. So if you are a RN with a ADN or a LPN, many sponsors or CROs will not hire. I do not disagree that a strong nursing background isn't better in some ways than a 4 year degree but many companies will auto-reject candidates who do not meet this minimum qualification. 
* Experienced worker, but no clinical research experience: I will be honest, most entry level roles in clinical research are going to be low paying. Clinical trial assistants, clinical trial coordinators, project assistants, etc. are usually stepping stone positions and will allow you to enter the field without previous research experience. If you have sales experience, consider pivoting to business development. Sites need people with financial experience, so if you have that in your background look for positions in that area. So many people come to clinical research by sort of falling into it- they use their current skillsets to pivot. 
* Student taking a gap year before medical school/grad school: I'll be the asshole and say it...don't. Please do not come to work at a site for a year and then hit the road once you get your acceptance letter because you need some clinical hours for your application. Just don't. This is a job that can take several months to get comfortable in, and training personnel is not quick. It's a disservice to everyone, look elsewhere for experience. 
* Foreign worker looking for visa sponsorship: This might be US-centric, but I have had a few colleagues over the years come to the US and it has been exceedingly difficult for them. It took years of working with one company before they moved to the US and in every case they told me it took a lot of convincing of various departments to sign off on it. If you are currently working in another country in clinical research, I would advise you stay there and look at that pathway through your existing company. I think that if you are already here and need a company to sponsor your visa that it would be very difficult. 
* Research scientist: Working in the lab and pivoting to clinical research is doable. I would suggest looking at companies that either have lab services in them and potentially pivoting there. Many labs are looking for project managers, etc. and those positions are definitely integral to the success of clinical trials.

**Other frequently asked questions:**

* What certifications should I get: None. Do not pay for them out of pocket, because is an employer wants you to have it then they should pay for it. You cannot sit for the CCRP, CCRA, CCRC, etc. certifications without relevant experience. If you want to go through a clinical research training course, you are welcome to do so but almost every employer is going to make you go through basic training like GCP when you get hired. 
* What masters should I get: If you want one, and want to pay for one then get whatever you want. There are very few positions in clinical research that require an advanced degree. So unless you want one of those positions, I would wait for an employer that has tuition reimbursement. 
* Can I have a referral: Probably not. Unless someone works with you, they probably aren't going to refer you for positions. Most companies want to know how you know that person and why you are recommending them. 

**Other tips, tricks, feedback:**

* One page resume and ensure that your experience highlights/is related to clinical research. If you are new to the industry, focus on soft skills like your organization or ability to meet deadlines. If you work in research, unless you are asked for a CV you don't need to put study titles on there just therapeutic area. 
* Job titles are not standardized. One site's clinical research assistant is another site's research data technician. One CRO's clinical trial associate is another CRO's clinical trial coordinator. Academic medical centers may use generic titles like ""research coordinator"". Some sponsors call their CRA's site managers. All of this to say, search websites with keywords to look for these positions. 
* Clinical research is not just working at a CRO, site, or a pharma/biotech company. Clinical research encompasses so many companies and departments- imaging vendors, labs, safety/pharmacovigilance, data management, regulatory affairs, manufacturing, quality assurance, etc. 
* Consider networking: ACRP has job boards, and I know some chapters will post positions for jobs in their areas. Reach out to recruiters on LinkedIn. Reach out to other clinical research professionals you know. 
* Clinical research associate (CRA) is not an entry level position. Enough said. 

Personally, what is happening now does not look as bad as it did in 2008/2009 but I feel for colleagues and friends dealing with uncertainty in this time. It sucks.

Comment for Managers about email requests during a monitor visit,"I am a CRA monitor at a new company. At my previous companies, we had full-time in-house CRAs to help with questions during the day, and my managers were respectful to be aware and not interrupt us when we were conducting a monitor visit. Now I an at a company who is trying a nifty new method of having no in-house CRAs and having the CRA monitor be the only point of contact for the site & for study management questions from the project manager. So when I am conducting a monitor visit, I have a constant flow of email requests from sites and from my needy project managers. They get irritated when I do not answer right away, and sometimes forward it to my line manager to tattle on me. I answer some of these and I cannot get to others. I feel like this is one reason that project managers & operations managers should be required to be a working CRA monitor first, or else they do not understand our work flow.

I need to explain to you \[out of touch\] managers what goes on at a monitor visit: I have several websites open concurrently, including (1) the patient database, (2) the electronic monitor report, (3) the electronic medical records, (4) the site's electronic regulatory files which contain extra medical records outside of the EMR such as AE logs and tumor logs, and (5) the electronic drug accountability logs to verify drug administration. I have to get all of these  screens to match up to the part of the data I am monitoring. For example - patient 2002's 7 week visit in the patient database at the tumor measurement part, plus patient 2002's 7 week clinic visit then CT scan in the medical records, then the site's 7 week tumor log. Plus I have to keep track in my mind what I am verifying, such as thinking to myself ""7 week abdominal lesion 3 cm...7 week pleural lesion 4.5 cm  - check this screen, now check this screen, remember what lesions I am verifying, remember 7 week abdominal lesion 3 cm""....)

So then I receive in-house messages saying ""Can you please stop and reply to site 347's email question about lab shipping?!"", ""Can you please stop and email all the sites about their outstanding issues?!"", ""Remember Susie - you are the main site contact and it is your job to answer site emails right away!"" etc etc like a chihuahua nipping at my ankles.

Whenever I stop monitoring for a couple minutes, all those screens above which contain sensitive patient information are programmed to time out. So then when I go back, I have to re-login in, then try to remember where I was then find it again, which can take a while. Then when I get all my screens opened, I still have to remember my train of thought and what I was monitoring. In addition, most sites have monitoring hours, for on-site and remote visits, such as to say that monitoring must end by 4:30 pm or 5:00 pm. So the time during the daytime when I am allowed to monitor is already limited and should not be cut into.

The other day during a monitor visit, in the course of several hours, I only got a few case report forms monitored, because of constant starting, stopping, re-logging in and finding my place again due to in-house questions. (Then they whine that I didn't get enough CRFs monitored and it won't look good for bragging rights to the sponsor).

So managers - please don't do this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1evuxnx/comment_for_managers_about_email_requests_during/,clinicalresearch,-0.9983478784561157
Removal from study,"I'm a CTM with 2 years of experience. I was notified today that the sponsor asked to remove me from the study.

I took over the study after it had no CTM for a month, with no handover for a FIH Oncology study and have been working very long hours to meet the sponsor's many requests.

If you're new to clinical research...,"I'd like to share some advice I received in the early 2000s that's paid off for me mixed in with what I've seen work and what's worked for me. As with all advice, if this doesn't sound right to you, there are countless ways in and through the field and I'm only sharing what I've done and seen work for others. Oh, last caveat is that this was advice from an MD also on the clinical path and was specific to me and what he recognized as my ambition and interest; there's no one size that fits all but this seems to fit a lot of us.

In no order:

1. Learn every SOP associated with your role such that you could teach it.

2. Same with the Regs: just keep them with you and instead of goofing off on your phone in line, read a regulation or SOP that you haven't memorized until you know them cold.

3. If you're not already, become as much of an expert as you can on the therapeutic.

4. Look for ways to do your job more efficiently while maintaining quality and compliance, for example build templates, tools, revise SOPs that don't make perfect sense, create mechanisms for better cost, study, compliance tracking, create better reporting tools - whatever it is: make it better and cheaper.

5. Never stay at an employer more than 2 years. Keep moving and learning new ways of process and execution, build more relationships, move up in role and salary if that's appealing. Companies look at someone with 5+ positions in a role, particularly ascending up the role, as an expert. Experts get paid.

6. Never ever under any circumstance complain about work. You will encounter hundreds if not thousands of frustrating and sometimes backward seeming systems, tools, processes, divisions of work, etc. If something can be done, do it: follow channels of reporting when appropriate, fix it or deal with it and move on. Lots of people complain - don't be one of them.

7. Practice if you have to but develop a real interest in the needs of your stakeholders and provide whatever support you can. 

8. When you're considering a new job, think about the kind of culture you want to work in. Does this place have a lot of turnover as in, are rats jumping ship? Is it a supportive environment? They're going to be asking you for examples, feel free to ask them for some because this is where you're going to be spending a lot of time.

9. Also when considering compensation in an offer, consider your TOTAL compensation package and not just the salary or salary+vacation. Add up those two variables plus other forms of comp like on-site childcare, 401(k) matching, bonus percentage and structure, insurance, etc. 

10. Take full ownership and accountability and never ever one time ever throw anyone under the bus and this does NOT mean cover for people's errors.

11.  Learn all systems that you'll interact with such that you could teach someone else how to use them. CTMS, EDC, coding tool, and understand the connections between both the systems themselves (sys architecture), understand how data flows.

12. In my experience, this is not a 40h/week job so prepare for that.

Burnt out CRC,"I will preface this post by saying I love my coworkers and I care very much about my patients. The patients are why I stay at my job. 

But on a day-to-day, I feel absolutely worthless and like a failure. Everyone scapegoats their mistakes to the CRC, and it‚Äôs exhausting to always be on the receiving end of it. 

No matter how hard I work, I‚Äôm told it‚Äôs not enough. No matter how carefully I follow the protocol, I get blamed for any and all mistakes that are a result of other study staff.

I love my coworkers and patients‚Ä¶I really do. They are what keep me here. But I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can take being treated so poorly. 

I‚Äôve never disliked myself as much as I do now. I feel like a failure, like nothing I do is good enough. My mental health and self-esteem have taken a major hit. My insomnia is worse than it‚Äôs ever been - I have sleepless nights because of the stress. I see a therapist, but I‚Äôve never been so depressed.

The Burden of Technology,"This is the rant that's been building in my head for the 12+ years I've worked in the biz; and is the elephant in the room for me. I don't know about you folks, but I estimate that I waste about 30% of my working hours trying to manage computer glitches, system integration/interfacing problems, slow systems, clicking my life away to get to the screen I need and then waiting for it to load, navigating non-intuitive systems that only work on certain browsers, and troubleshooting access issues for sites and self. 

I have an iphone for personal use and a Samsung for work that I still struggle with after several years of use. Among other things, I usually forget how to change my greeting for OOO between days off and so have to google help options on my iphone to help me figure out how to use specific functions on my Samsung. I travel with my laptop, a portable monitor, my ipad for personal use, 2 phones, airpods, headphones (for the plane b/c airpods hurt my ears if I wear them too long but don't want to wear headphones while on site if it comes down to that) and all of the matching cables and chargers. I have multiple work-specific apps on my Samsung including 2-FA. 

I'm currently working on a study with > 10 vendors- all with their own required trainings, query systems and pathways to request access and information, and that's on top of the already cumbersome CTMS and TMF systems that we work with on a daily basis. Plus we've  got our travel sites, time trackers, visit trackers, expense reports and e-learning sites. If we run into glitches we need to submit IT tickets and then might have to wait > 1 week for a response depending on the urgency...And when the response is received, it is often written in technical jargon that I do not understand. I also can't readily figure out which of my current IT issues the response is related to...because it only provides a reference number and not the name of the system or issue that warranted the actual submission of the ticket in the first place. We use eSignature sites, scanning apps and NitroPro and learn our site's  eSource, eReg and EHR systems on the fly. Sites contact their CRAs to help troubleshoot technical issues on the site end, because it is too burdensome to contact the vendor's helpdesk and go through the phone tree and have to wait and wait and wait to be connected to a person who can actually provide assistance. CRAs turn to their study teams for the same reason. Why am I considered a contact to troubleshoot glitches on vendor websites? Because the helpdesks are not efficient or effective, and the thought of having to call a helpdesk makes the vast majority of us cringe.

We get so many e-mails. Tons of e-mails! So many that the culture is to ping someone on Teams if you need a response sooner than later- because you can't rely on anyone actually noticing your e-mail unless it's marked as urgent...but not even then b/c there are so many e-mails marked as urgent. 

Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling (sung to the tune of Rawhide) pops into my head every time I go digging through my inbox in search of the one e-mail that I need- that I just saw! That I can't find via a search...and so I must scroll and scroll and scroll....feels like I must have scrolled through at least a few days'-worth of e-mail at this point...but then sadly realize I had only scrolled through a few hours'-worth.

We've got Box, Sharepoint and more spreadsheets than I can manage...and we're expected to filter for our sites to help prep for our visits. We've got spreadsheets giving birth to spreadsheets. We receive e-mails with multiple attachments that often have embedded spreadsheets. 

I have come close to having a meltdown when I get into a rental car and can't figure out how to start it. I'm onto all of the start buttons that are sometimes hidden in strange places...but I am occassionaly thrown for a loop when I am given a keyfob that actually holds a real, old-fashioned key inside- one that I  have to insert into the ignition and turn in order for the car to start. Sometimes I can't figure out how to pop the gas tank; and I flat out decompensate if I can't sync my Apple Car Play to the rental.

I'm a CRA at a large CRO who really likes my job for the most part. It's rarely the travel or heavy caseload that gets me to the point of the intense, high-level frustration like I have with all of these technology issues. Unfortunately it happens with great frequency, makes my heart race in anger, and wears me down.

Just passed CCRP exam!,"Just wanted to say thanks to everyone on this sub that posted tips and pointers on what to study! Going into the exam, I thought it was going to be relatively easy. As someone with just 1.5 years of CRC experience, it was actually quite difficult, and I found myself guessing on >30% of questions. It was nothing short of a miracle that I got a pretty good score... I was definitely not 100% confident that I would pass. 

Some pointers for anyone taking the test in the future:

\- Heavy on sponsor vs investigator responsibilities (as many previously mentioned)

\- Unexpectedly heavy on all things related to IRBs

\- Know your record retention requirements! A good chunk of questions were just these, reworded over and over

\- Know your reporting timelines for INDs/IDEs! There weren't as many questions as I thought there were going to be, but it's not too hard to memorize and will score you a good chunk of points

\- Quite a few questions on informed consent -- short form process, required signatures, requirements for waiving, emergency use without obtaining consent, etc.

\- Some unexpected questions about NIH funded studies and what information and when to upload results to [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov)! 

\- Handful of questions on vulnerable populations

\- A not-insignificant number of questions regarding electronic systems

Participant refusing to sign updated consent,"One of my teams has a participant that‚Äôs been on treatment for a while now without issue, but is now refusing to sign a recently updated ICF as they object to the sponsors changes to the study treatment. The sponsor discontinued a retreatment option and post trial access option during a recent global protocol amendment, for business reasons. The participant believes that by refusing to sign, the change won‚Äôt apply to them and they will still be entitled to the now discontinued treatment options. The circumstances around their refusal was documented thoroughly in the source and the sponsor was made aware, discussions are ongoing. 

The original ICF the participant signed did contain language outlining that additional treatment was not guaranteed, so they were informed this was a possibility. My concern in this situation is more focused on the moral/ethical implication of a sponsor discontinuing the option for access to continued treatment for business ($$$) reasons and not for safety reasons, which has removed this participants only remaining treatment option for their advanced disease. They had been stable on the drug up to this point, and accessing the additional treatment courses was in their best interest. 

For those of you at site level - have any of you have encountered this situation before, if so how did it pan out?

For those of you at sponsor level - have you encountered this, if so have you had a site be successful in arguing for the participant to still receive now discontinued additional doses under these circumstances?

"Many sites, including large, well-respected institutions, have SOPs for IND Safety Report Review that violate FDA regulations and don‚Äôt seem to realize it","I am a CRA working on an oncology trial that‚Äôs in startup and site initiation. 

I‚Äôm new to oncology but have worked as a CRA for years now and was a CRC for many years before that. 

I had always heard that a major pain point for oncology trials was safety reporting. Especially the number of IND safety reports that are issued for trials. 

I absolutely get the frustration with sponsor over reporting and the drain on resources and I was and still am a big proponent of sites finding ways to push back on things that don‚Äôt make sense. 

That being said, I‚Äôve discovered that a disturbing number of huge, well respected cancer research centers in the United States have SOPs for safety report review that violate federal regulations (and GCP).

It seems to me that at some point a few years ago, these institutions started getting bad information from somewhere telling them that Investigators do not have an obligation to acknowledge, review, file, or report any IND Safety Reports unless the sponsor classifies the event as an Unanticipated Problem. 

Their SOPs state that unless the sponsor provides them with a document confirming the event is considered an Unanticipated Problem, per the 2012 FDA Guidance on Safety Reporting, AND provides the study documents that are being changed in response to the increase in risk to subjects, then they will not look at the reports at all. 

The problem with these SOPs is that they are based on faulty interpretations of Federal Law, FDA Guidance, OHRP guidance, and GCP. 

I do understand where the confusion stems from. The FDA has done a very poor job of providing clear language on this topic because past guidance focused too heavily on the IRB reporting portion of the investigator‚Äôs obligations and did not specifically address, in direct language, the investigator‚Äôs obligations for review.

And the law itself is implicit rather than explicit in stating the reports must be reviewed by the investigator. However, that is true for a lot of things an investigator is required to do. 

But I am seeing a huge number of sites that are deeply misunderstanding their responsibility for reviewing each (legitimate) safety report that meets the federal requirements for IND Safety Reporting per the regulations. In general terms, this means Adverse Events that are:

1. Serious 
2. Unexpected (not listed in the Investigator Brochure as a known potential risk, or occurring at greater frequency or severity then what is listed) 
3. Related to Research (There‚Äôs a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by the research drug)

Sponsors are obligated by law to report every event that meets the above criteria to both the FDA and ALL investigators participating in research for the product. 

Some sites appear to believe that the 2012 guidance relieves the PI of the responsibility for reviewing these legally required safety reports because of statements that note the sponsor is in a better position to evaluate and determine expectedness. However, this language is explaining to sponsors and sites why it is the sponsor‚Äôs job to provide certain data points in their IND Safety reports, and why the sponsor‚Äôs evaluation of causality takes precedence (but sponsor must still make every attempt to obtain the investigator‚Äôs causality judgment). 

The guidance is also trying to explain why reporting all events to IRB isn‚Äôt useful. However, it is NOT saying that PI receipt AND review isn‚Äôt required. 

After a lot of research, discussions, digging through FDA archives, etc, I was able to locate responses from the FDA, in reply to sponsor and site questions about this topic. And the FDA makes it clear: As part of the PI‚Äôs responsibility to ensure the safety and welfare of the subject, they must review ALL IND Safety Reports and they must be able to demonstrate that review. 

One of the largest cancer centers in the country had a similar SOP up until 2022. However, records show that after complaints were received at the FDA from sponsors that were deeply concerned about this trend and their policy specifically, the FDA had discussions with this site about their SOP. And the FDA made it clear that investigators can not ignore IND Safety Reports. 

The FDA informed them that the investigator must review all IND Safety Reports issued to them by the sponsor, that they must have documentation of their review (just like everything in this industry if it isn‚Äôt documented it did not happen), and they must determine if the event is reportable to the IRB. 

It does appear that the investigator can delegate review to a qualified, trained individual, just like other activities. But investigators should be prepared to justify and demonstrate their selection, training and delegation of that individual.

This institution has stated in publicly that the FDA informed them during these talks that during an inspection, they could demand to know why certain reports were not submitted to the IRB within the reporting window and they would expect there to be contemporaneous documentation justifying it. 

It‚Äôs not enough to say that because the sponsor didn‚Äôt classify it as an ‚ÄúUnanticipated Problem‚Äù, it didn‚Äôt need to be reported. 

And it‚Äôs important to understand that every report you receive as an investigator, the FDA also receives, because that‚Äôs the law. So when they come for an inspection, they already know what‚Äôs supposed to be on file at the site. 

This issue is one that is very widespread and that appears to be impacting large, well-respected institutions and small organizations alike. It appears that the FDA is trying to better address and clarify this issue in future guidance documents, as the current draft guidance for Investigator Obligations for IND Reporting now has clearer language stating that the investigator must review reports. However, I have run into a number of sites that still refuse to change their policies because it‚Äôs a Draft Guidance.  

They don‚Äôt seem to understand that this isn‚Äôt a new recommendation, but rather an obligation that, in the FDA‚Äôs eyes, is required by federal law and has been all this time. 

So what are your experiences with IND Safety Report review? Does your site have one of these policies? CRAs and Sponsors: Are you seeing sites with these SOPs?

I do think that this is a major risk area that is being overlooked and misunderstood by many in our industry and I think better education is needed all around.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/17iqdtw/many_sites_including_large_wellrespected/,clinicalresearch,-0.9986044764518738
10 year career progression - what was yours?,"I feel like many career ladders are predictable but ours is not, which can be good for pivoting to a change, but also frustrating. Interested to see what peoples paths look like!

I for instance was a CRC for about 5 years (site level), CRA to senior CRA over 4 years (CRO) and now a Clin Ops Lead (Sponsor). About 10 years in industry now. I've been underpaid, missed promotions because my manager 'forgot' and all the rest. But happy with where I am now.

"""Let me know if you need any help!""","When project managers email requests, and some of these requests are a little unreasonable considering CRA's workload, they often copy the line manager, then at at the end of the email, they always add a tag line that says ""And let me know if you need any help"" to make themselves look nice in front of everyone. Or when they teams message things that they want done really fast, even if we are in a monitor visit and can't reasonable stop and do it, but they just want it right now, they will again say ""Can you please do such and such for me right now. Let me know if you need any help!"" 

I wish they would just admit that ""let me know if you need any help"" actually means ""hurry up, I want what I want right now."" The phoniness is hard for me to process, and it wears on me.

I wish I could call their bluff and take them up on their offer. In my imagination, I would like to reply with something such as ""Thank you so much for asking how you can help. Actually I could use some help. I am working 12 hours every day doing monitor visits plus site management under the table for free.

Terrible Medpace Interview Experience,"Did an interview with Medpace last week after they kept me waiting for a month or more (applied in January, interviewed in early Feb) to hear back on next steps. I had 2 back-to-back interviews with my potential supervisors and hiring managers.

First interview with a Senior Director who completed my interview from an airport lounge after telling me they didn‚Äôt not know they had an interview scheduled with me at that time. I still continued to complete it while maintaining composure trying to make the best of it. I could see people multiple walking behind them even with a blur background on. 

Second interviewer was a Director who was late and first interviewer had to call second interviewer from their cell while on the video call to see what was up. It was awk. They did apologize for being late, but they were frazzled, unprepared, and seemed distracted throughout the conversation. During the interview I did had to ask them if they had any questions for me or wanted me to dive deeper into the experiences I shared and felt like I was the one driving the interview. 

Got system generated rejection email today. Thankfully they didn‚Äôt take another month to deliver the news. Sad because the pay seemed great but happy because I think I would have been miserable if this is how they treat candidates. 

I did forward the system generated rejection email and a lengthy email to my HR recruiter describing the unprofessional experience even it falls on deaf ears.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1c55sox/terrible_medpace_interview_experience/,clinicalresearch,-0.9955546259880066

Just another rage post about the hiring process and a certain gatekeeping group showing how out of touch they are #linkedinlunatics,"Yeah yeah, I know, just step back...but seriously not a week goes by that I don't see this CRAResources group putting out some out of touch ""advice"" usually tailored to hiring managers that is probably why it's even harder to get a job leaving out economic factors.

For your SDR, I have presented these grabs which show the CRAR leader plugging this 13 year old accreditation organization, which is owned by a business school person with no clinical background and, from looking at their LinkedIn page, has all of one person out of <20 employees who actually does.

Is it not bad enough we have to fork over $700 for SOCRA or ACRP, take a test and all that BS, or, you know, have dozens of people in this sphere who would vouch for us? No, we have this expert plugging yet ANOTHER organization (*cough* grift *cough*) and perpetuating and normalizing the idea of so many fraudulent candidates, causing us hungries out here to have to go through like 7 rounds of interviews instead of saying ""well geez can we do better on initial recruiter background checks and maybe look at ourselves for letting in fakes?!?!"" Of course not, and instead of self crit this ""hiring expert"" is showing that she's really learned nothing and is still liable to fall for tricksters like fake candidates and ""IAOCR"" (if she's not in on the scam herself, but I digress).

And $912?! Fuck you

P.S. before any bootlickers and gatekeepers say it, we all know some companies will pay for such accreditations/tests/memberships..but 1) again, wtf gives this decade-old dork org any credibility? and 2) some of us are OUT OF WORK, and I think posting things like this coerces some of the desperate among us to actually fork over the cash.

Cancelled/Unfulfilled Promotion (CRA),"This is probably a common sense post as far as career guidance but still something I wanted to share.

My promotion from CRA I to CRA II was just canceled. My line manager essentially told me this decision was due to funding issues. I have been a CRA with this CRO for 2 years and a CRA altogether for 3 years. I have been told routinely for the better part of the past year that an upcoming promotion was basically guaranteed. During my annual performance review, my line manager even told me that they were ‚Äúfor sure it would happen‚Äù. My performance has been sufficient, so I do not think the decision to cancel the promotion was related to performance. I had honestly been looking forward to this for a while and felt confident that 3 years as a CRA was a good marker for promotion. I have seen plenty of CRAs hired at my CRO with 2 years or even less of CRA experience immediately get hired as a CRA II. 

The only thing I can say is to always act in your own interest, and never get strung along to this BS. Your manager may be an objectively good manager, but at least at a CRO, they are never going to be the reason you get a promotion because it‚Äôs frankly out of their hands. It is quite likely they are talking out of their ass when they try to convince you a promotion or big raise is happening.

... but the stress and burnout is impossible to manage. No training besides a few weeks of SOP reading, management is supportive but not particularly helpful, and my ""mentor"" quit before imparting any real wisdom on me... Stop me if you've heard this before. I've been in this industry for a short time, but I've been around long enough to know that this is how it's going everywhere right now. I can't do it anymore. Most days I just stare blankly at my computer and I can't get anything done. My manager/team is starting to notice my work quality declining and I feel like I am mentally/emotionally/physically on autopilot. Motivation is zero, deadlines are being missed, and I am quickly self destructing at this point.

Did I screw myself by jumping up the ladder too fast? Should I consider ""demoting myself"" in an attempt to preserve my mental health? Would doing this destroy any future career progression chances I have? I still see myself being in this industry in the future because my eggs are all in one basket at this point. I'm just wondering if it's possible to take a few steps back and then try to re-enter the rat race when I can get my head back into the game.

So tired of being ‚Äúworking poor‚Äù! ,"I live in SoFla and work as a research coordinator.

The employees even said ‚Äúit‚Äôs easy to fake the signatures of the illiterate participants‚Äù. I was really shocked and didn‚Äôt say anything. The reason why they faked signatures is because the person didnt sign on all the pages of the consent form.

My monitor for this study said she hasn‚Äôt been home in over a month and a half. Her husband called her asking if he needed to quit his job and travel with her. While i get she is being extremely overworked right now- the thing that absolutely irks me is that she will not give me a list of things she needs until she comes on site, after asking her multiple times to get that to me at least a business day prior. She sent me a MVL at 11:59pm a few months ago and expects me to get sources and ICF to her at 8, when i also get in at 8, and both me and my manager have told her that without proper communication, she will not be getting the sources she needs to complete her day.

"I hate my job (CTM), but I feel stuck given my salary. What other options do I have?","Tl;Dr: hate working as a CTM, what are some other positions in a CRO (besides PM) that have a comparable salary and translatable skill set that I may not have heard about? 

Long version. I started as a contract CRC for the department of defense 7 years ago and LOVED my work in emergency medicine research. My starting salary was $45k, and within 4 years and multiple contracts later I'd negotiated that up to 75k. After a new contracting company took over and kneecapped us all, I decided to go private sector and got a position as a CTA. Within a year I was in a PM role. When my husband relocated for work, I took a remote opportunity as a CTM with one of the big CROs. My current salary is $130k. 

I HATE this fucking job. It's been a year and a half and I'm having breakdowns daily. I don't know what I'm doing, having not been a CRA- quite frankly I don't even know why they hired me. My boss seems to think I'm doing great, but I cannot do this job any longer. I need to transition into another CRO role but I'm coming up against a wall when trying to look into areas to transition into. The logical step is laterally to PM/PL, since the salary is basically the same, but honestly PL sounds even worse than CTM...I don't want to deal with financial bullshit. 

The only part of my job I enjoy is working with my sites to help them problem solve. I do great with unique and challenging situations that require finesse to solve them. I like helping people, and as a CRC I got to do that daily... Not so much now. Now it's just bullshit track this and file that and update 9000 sponsor trackers with information they have access to but don't want to look up themselves. I spend more time updating agendas and trackers than I do anything else, and it's crushing my damn soul. In addition, I'm overseeing CRAs who come to me for advice that I often don't have, having not been in their position before. Had I known I'd be managing CRAs to this level, I would not have accepted the position because I'm not fit for it.

Anyways - I'm here and I need to get out, but I'm having trouble finding a new position that feels like the right fit....and has a comparable salary. Due to my living situation I unfortunately cannot take a huge hit salary wise. I know PM is the obvious alternative, but I'm hoping some of y'all might know of some lesser known positions that might work with my skills and interests. I am not set on leaving my company as overall I feel supported and the benefits are great, but I will leave if the right position comes along. I just need help figuring out what positions are even out there for me to look into.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/11z3s5u/i_hate_my_job_ctm_but_i_feel_stuck_given_my/,clinicalresearch,-0.9952594637870789

RESUME ADVICE - Provide below!,"It seems to be a daily occurrence on this thread where people ask for resume advice or tips for breaking into clinical research. So, I figured I'd consolidate recommendations for both into one post.

Other Redditors in the field, please leave your tips here as well!

**RESUMES:**

1. One of the most common mistakes I see for people with no/limited experience is including a ""Career Summary"" section. I promise, you do not need this yet! In fact, it's taking up a lot of valuable space.
2. Instead, replace it with a ""Skills"" section. Include hard and soft skills, especially those mentioned in the job description. Ideally you want to incorporate as many of these as you can into your work experience, but often times there's a lot listed in the job description, and you need to pass through the ATS!
3. Related to the above: KEYWORDS. I know you all have heard this a million times, but it's so important. If you don't include keywords that are found in the job description, it's likely your resume will never be seen by human eyes. ATS is used to quickly scan resumes, and if the system deems yours to be irrelevant/not a close enough match, it will be thrown out almost immediately.
4. Another ATS tip: include the name of the role you're applying for in your resume. If this is not a role you've had previously, include something like ""*Aspiring \[role name\]*"" directly under your name.
5. Find an ATS scanner online to run your resume through. There's plenty of free ones. Jobscan will even allow you to compare your resume to the job description and tell you what you're missing
6. Less is more: No one wants to open a resume and see an essay. Keep in mind how many other resumes hiring managers have to look through in a day. Find ways to consolidate bullet points and make it quick and easy to read (a decision is made on whether to discard or advance your resume in ***less than 10 seconds*** \- you need to draw them in!)
7. Give yourselves a little credit: If you're the best at what you do in your current role (you're the person to go to for questions, expert on a certain process, train others to do X), make that clear!
8. Use action verbs that portray your true level of responsibility. If you were solely responsible for X or managed a team, use verbs like coordinated, delegated, developed, directed, managed, oversaw, etc.
9. If you've just graduated and don't have any experience, mention any relevant courses, research projects you completed for class, and any awards/honors, no matter how small they seem to you (and be prepared to talk about all of this in your interviews!)
10. My last point here is going to seem silly and controversial to some, as I know it's taught not to do this in HS/college; **use color**! Change the color of headings and/or your name. It's such a simple way to draw attention. Don't do anything super vibrant like bright red, but soft blues or greens are pleasant

&#x200B;

**Breaking into the field:**

1. I'm just going to start right off with saying - it can be INCREDIBLY difficult to break into clinical research for the first time. We have all been there. It took me more than a year just to get a research assistant role. **Don't give up!**
2. Use LinkedIn for all that it's worth. Connect with and message recruiters. If they don't respond, message again.
3. Ambition is great... but be realistic. If you have 0 experience, and you're applying to management roles, you're wasting your time. Go to the website for the companies you want to apply for and see what kind of entry level roles they offer. Know that you will get your desired role eventually, but you need to climb the ladder first
4. You don't 'have' to start at point A to get to point B. Most people aim for RA / CTA / CRC positions (just like I did!) because they don't realize what else is out there. Here's a few other departments that all have entry level roles: pharmacovigilance, TMF, budget/contracts, regulatory affairs, data coordinator and study start up/site activation.

If there's anything specific you need answers for please ask and I'll do my best to help out!

Is it possible to avoid burnout in this industry?,"I have worked in clinical research now for about 8 years. I‚Äôve worked both on the site side and industry/sponsor side. I am very passionate about research, I really believe in the incredible value this industry provides to healthcare and our communities. So far, every job I‚Äôve had has lead to an insane workload and high stress, and feeling undervalued. As I get older, the stress is starting to take a toll on my personal life including my physical and mental health. I so badly want to stay in this industry but no job is worth sacrificing my health and relationships for. I‚Äôm beginning to wonder if it‚Äôs possible to have both - a happy/healthy personal life and a fruitful career in clinical research. Is this just the nature of the industry we are in? How does one find a clinical research role with manageable stress and workload? Is there a specific role/title associated with lower stress or is it more of a company culture to look for?

CRA life might not be for me after all,"I recently became a CRA at a large CRO and while I love the job itself, I am realizing that I might not be ok with the lack of work-life balance. I knew what the CRA life entailed when I was applying for the job, hell I was even excited to never be home and alway be on the road, however with the workload I have, I am usually gone for a week at a time. I can‚Äôt get anything personal done during the week, and I‚Äôm left with 2 days to run my errands and see family/friends (that‚Äôs if I‚Äôm done all my reports during the week and don‚Äôt need to catch up on work during the weekend). I am currently thinking of getting the experience for a year and attempt to apply into pharma as a CRA since they usually have a little less of a workload compared to CROs or even a smaller CRO, although I‚Äôm not sure the grass is greener on the other side. Initially, I wanted to become a CTM/project manager/line manager after a few years as a CRA, but looking at my colleagues, they don‚Äôt seem to have much of a work-life balance either, even though there is almost no travel involved. Now, I am contemplating other career paths (whether in clinical trials but in a role that gives more freedom so I can actually live my life and not be a slave to the industry, but that also pays well, or in another field completely). When I talk to older colleagues, they talked about how amazing the CRA role used to be and that‚Äôs what drew me to the role. They definitely did not have as much of a workload as we currently do, and I don‚Äôt see it getting any better at any company any time soon.

We are skilled multitaskers, managing many studies across vastly different therapeutic areas. We are often the first point of contact for patients enrolling in clinical trials.

WCG Has Become Really Frustrating,"Vent...

I don't know if anyone else is having similar issues, but it feels like in the last year or so that WCG has gone way downhill.  They used to be so reliably solid, it was a pleasure working with them through PAs, ICF updates, etc.  Now I'm not getting sign-off requests in a timely manner, missing regulatory letters, ""Corrected"" COAs that are issued that are identical to the original COAs.  

Also the Connexus portal, WTF???? Five years ago on the old portal I could open a submission and see all of the documents in that submission and then all outcome documents for that submission.  Now I can be approved for an IB or PA and have no access to that IB or PA.  That makes no sense!  When I raised my concern about this they said it was because the IRB couldn't be sure who from what companies should have access to documents that may be confidential.  That's not a reason!  Each site wouldn't okay access to Connexus if they didn't want that staff member to see study documents???  There was no indication that there were any security concerns with this process when we could see submission documents.  It is unethical to have sites operating in this space blindly and unable to see all details of a submission.  Andplusalso, in the portal on the list of submissions, it would give me the approval date of that submission for my site.  Now it shows the submission and ""Fully Approved"" but that's because it's fully approved at the study level! Completely irrespective of site-level approval.  I don't care that it's approved at the study level, show me when and if it's approved for *my* coordinators to use.

Has anyone quit being a CRA because of a site from hell?,"I can‚Äôt take working with these fools anymore. I‚Äôve had them for4 years and the study isn‚Äôt scheduled to end until 2028! I can‚Äôt exactly ask my LM to move me off because I hate them and might quit if they don‚Äôt. 

The PI is crazy. The coordinator is lazy and never asks any questions or let‚Äôs me know about issues, just does whatever and waits for me to find issues and tell her how to fix them. And then takes 6 months to fix it or provide a simple document like an updated medical license. The sponsor knows, and said they won‚Äôt work with them again but will let the patients finish the study. They think the benefits outweigh the risks still. 

So I may have to remove myself because no way can I have a 5 year long headache. Any advice??",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1adh11q/has_anyone_quit_being_a_cra_because_of_a_site/,clinicalresearch,-0.9991610050201416

Once on Flock i tried to video call and call but they said they can not connect me. I proceeded with a virtual address that was required to complete an assessment. All of it seems like a scam.

Advice for new CRAs,"Current and former CRAs, add your advice as well!

First off, I see lots of you getting interviews and I say CONGRATS! For those of you get and accept offers, welcome! 

I‚Äôve been a CRA for 10+ years (I‚Äôm old, ask me about ancient times lol) so here are a few things I‚Äôve learned over the years. I think that there are some things that are obvious- good time management skills or being organized. So here are some that I think aren‚Äôt always obvious. 

1.  Take care of yourself! When/if you travel, please take care of your health. Mental, physical, emotional...all of it. Try to exercise, eat healthy, and take some time for yourself. Traveling a couple of hours, spending a day on site, then taking a few hours at night to catch up on things you missed during the day times 3-4 days a week will be tiring. Meditate, sight see, decompress...but always remember that the best CRA is the CRA who isn‚Äôt one day away from a breakdown. 

2.  Keep it simple. Lots of people will give you trackers, or tell you to pack this in your bag because you‚Äôll need it. Look for ways the multitask or items that multitask. This is general but as a rule I don‚Äôt carry paper when I travel other than a notepad and post it notes. No sense packing a protocol and all the other manuals, etc. 

3.  Relationships- I can‚Äôt stress this enough. I‚Äôve gone on visits with new CRAs and it‚Äôs a skill that can take some time. 100% always operate under the protocol, regulations, ICH GCP, and sponsor SOPs/policies. But, look at how you can leverage those to help your sites. It‚Äôs frustrating for a site to hear they have to do something without a lot of reason why and being told to do it when it goes against their practice/policy. When I take on a site, I always try to make it clear that we are working for the same goal and that I‚Äôm here to be their resource, support, and advocate. But...they have to show a good faith effort to work with me. This is not license to be bossy or demanding. 

4.  Push back- You will realize that some sites, no matter the PI or CRC, are a mess. You will realize that some requests from study teams are ridiculous. Do not let people steam roll over you. Tell your manager the concerns you have with a site. Tell a project manager that you know your site can‚Äôt accommodate a request because XYZ. Sometimes they understand, sometimes they don‚Äôt.  If they don‚Äôt, try to find a compromise. 

5. Ask for help- You are not failing, you are not being a burden. For example, if you have a site that enrolls rapidly and you need a co-monitor, asking for help shows that your committed to ensuring quality. Keeping quiet and letting yourself get backlogged is bad for everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/n9zkpr/advice_for_new_cras/,clinicalresearch,-0.7327036261558533
Site initiation training ,"Pharma/CRO study start up teams: do you ever chat on your end about how silly it is that study training for sites is usually just someone reading slides word for word to us for 4 hours?

IQVIA Merit Increase Delay,"Well, just got my first paycheck without my merit increase included and am pretty bummed.

This post is mostly to vent. Feeling pretty upset that this is the 2nd time in 4 years I‚Äôve had a delay in merit increase and promotion (1st time during Covid). I understand others are getting laid off and that is obviously worse, but it still sucks. I normally am a very hard worker but I‚Äôve been feeling extremely demotivated since the announcement and have definitely been slacking off and doing the bare minimum (still meeting metrics). My goal was to get a promotion this year but I just can‚Äôt make myself put in the effort as I‚Äôm a financially motivated person. I should feel grateful to still have a job, but right now I‚Äôm just feeling held back.

Anyway, I know I‚Äôm not alone in these feelings and thought it might be good to create an outlet for others who are in the same position. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1e1mu77/iqvia_merit_increase_delay/,clinicalresearch,-0.9983587861061096
CRA metrics sabotaged by reviewer,"I‚Äôve been an oncology CRA for 8 yrs. Never had any late reports until recently. The reviewer just finalized my 2nd late report this year. I submit all my report by day 2-3. Reviewer doesn‚Äôt review until last minute. I‚Äôve escalated, sent reminders, messaged on Teams, etc. It is death by metrics as a CRA. My manager is very supportive but it‚Äôs the higher ups that just see my name and a low metric and don‚Äôt know or care about the back story. I‚Äôm at a large CRO and wish the job market were better. Quitting isn‚Äôt an option. I‚Äôm the primary paycheck and insurance holder. I‚Äôve asked to be taken off the study and assigned to a different one. I‚Äôm so frustrated and angry. I‚Äôve sent my CV to former workplaces. I‚Äôve always left on good terms.  I will probably blow a gasket if I have to do additional training or a performance improvement plan.

Work hours are getting ridiculous,"I‚Äôve been a CRC for 2 years at a large academic institution in Australia. Recently became lead on a Phase 1 onc study and it‚Äôs just insane. Usually working 10-11 hours a day. Most Fridays I‚Äôll do 12+ hours in an attempt to come back to a clean desk. Basically no time for a social life when you factor in sleep and part-time study. 

I don‚Äôt really have particularly many trials, just the Ph1 has an extremely frustrating/demanding sponsor. The PI is quite anxious as it‚Äôs his first big trial so he won‚Äôt push back on their incessant requests for everything under the sun by EOB. 

Also recently found out I‚Äôm having a sponsor audit (high recruiting site) so there‚Äôs that added looming pressure now too.

Unnecessarily complicated ,"The reason there‚Äôs so much difficulty to work in this industry is because it‚Äôs a complicated process. However instead of simplifying the industry is making it more complicated more specialized and unitized to the smallest amount so that you can profit from them. On the flip side it‚Äôs actually getting less efficient. Take an example, CTM used to review trip report. That helped the know a lot about CRAs and sites. Now to reduce the cost they have hired someone across the ocean who h never interact with CTM or CRAs or the sites. When some issues appear no one has a clue. Same with other areas. One person knows about the site budget, the one reviews the invoice have no idea about the site or study and someone discovers years down the line why you paid thousands of dollars for no reason. I hope at some point industry realized that making a core team who who resides in the same reason and fully allocated to one study is the most efficient.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1bekcoh/unnecessarily_complicated/,clinicalresearch,-0.9992259740829468

With Uber fares soaring above $600, a 3.5-hour wait for a massive 12-passenger van (the only available rental car), and a perilous encounter with an 18-wheeler on icy roads, I've learned my lesson about braving inclement weather for a monitoring visit.

Venting CRA.,"So, I just needed a moment to vent after what happened today. I've been doing back to back monitoring visits this week...flew out Sunday to get to LA for a visit on Monday, then flew out that evening to Vegas for a site visit on Tuesday, then I flew out today to get back home. I have a remote visit on Thursday, and to top everything off, my Uncle died on Monday and I have a funeral on Friday. 

I'm currently 'assisting' a study right now because they have over 700 queries that need to get done before the 30th due to a DBL.  I was told specifically that I'm there to just help with the queries and co-monitor here and there. Which I was fine with, however, they've been pushing the boundaries constantly which I sort of just dealt with. 

Today, while boarding my flight, I got a messge out of the blue from a director and a COL that I **absolutely had** to complete a MV for a site tomorrow or Friday. They had not told me before today, that they expected me to do a MV. Literally, on a Wednesday, they told me I had to respond to the site ASAP, and fill out this form and everything so that I could do the visit by tomorrow or Friday. Immediately, I told them I already had another MV already planned for Thursday and that I had a funeral that I had to go to on Friday and I had already asked for the day off.

They completely ignored the fact that I had these things, and continued to tell me that the visit needed to be done and that I could do 'two half days'. Excuse me?! Why can't the assigned CRA do it? I'm not even the assigned CRA to this site, so why does this lie with me now?!

On Thursday I am interviewing with a CRO for a CTC role. FSP to a sponsor. I've been an oncology CRC for two years now. Two years ago I questioned what the heck I was doing and if I just go lucky because one of the doctor's liked me handling her schedule and gave me a job.

That job became a career and now I am the lead on nearly a dozen breast medical oncology trials (phase Ib-III). I've done everything from getting the CDA signed, completing site feasibility with the PI, to screening, enrollment, dispensing drug, monitoring AE's, submitting trucks of SAE's, to watching patient's die right in front of me, and then sometimes seeing them get pCR's after their surgery. 

I've battled DM's over queries, pulled receipts on scientists  who questioned by PI in San Antonio about why we took a patient off study when that specific scientist told me to take them off study after MM review. I've closed out a study with the PI besides doing the final interview and the monitor spilling their guts how they wished they had another study with me involved.

I think I did it. I became a CRC and I just second-guessed myself at the beginning.

Best part? Well, besides my patients? I've held other coordinators find their ways and becomes successful. I've helped, conquered, trained, developed, etc.

THAT BEING SAID. I am nervous. I know I can handle the CTC role - but I am nervous for the actual interview. I had a preliminary phone call with the recruiter today and reviewed a few things to be discussed/questioned on during the interview (site situations, STAR method situations while on site, experience with excel and pivot tables, knowledge of TMF files, career trajectory, etc).

How should I prepare myself?   


* I am writing down about four to five STAR example situations that I have handled as a CRC (from the ranking of a blue shell in MarioKart to a banana). My first one is *excellent*.
* I printed out a handbook on TMF files to review because I have NEVER utilized one but boy will I know about them by Thursday. 
* I am listing strengths I have as a coordinator that will connect to the industry side as well as one or two weaknesses in case asked.
* I have answers why I am starting in the industry as a CTC versus looking at academies for a CRA (5 year old son, kindergarten, give me 2-3 years with the company and I'll be a CRA when he is too busy playing Minecraft/Roblox and won't mind me being away a few days a week).
* I have answers as to why I am leaving my site that are solid: career trajectory and discussion with my PI as she is leaving the company and knows that I am meant for more - and that means leaving site side.
* I am opening Excel tonight and practicing the hell out of it and will know how to make pivot tables to a T. Or at least, the start of it. I do have a bedtime but it feels like I'm in college and I'm prepping for an exam that I have to pass or else my GPA is screwed so come at me Excel, it's be friends.
* I have a mindful discussion of how I handle documentation (you should see my notes from study visits because I go into *detail*). I used to be a fanfiction writer (I refuse to lie), so I can *write*.
* Answers to if I am ready to leave patient facing after doing that for 10 years now (7 years in physical therapy and 3 years at the hospital) - Yes, I am. I love my patients and will always have connections with them, but as personal career growth, I have faced the true knowledge that it means industry is the best place to do so. And that doesn't mean I'll be any less ""patient facing"" in my mind, because I will get to see the true end result of clinical trials as they move through their phases. 
* I have reviewed the CRO's website and nailed on the head my favorite value of theirs: respect. I'm Asian-American (Filipino) and respect is glued to my forehead. I have examples of why respect is of importance to me and how it applies to the workplace and team members you work with.
* I have recited answers to questions that I know could potentially be asked while I am driving to get the words encoded in my head. I want to be answer/interview ready without using the word ""um"" once during my interview. Okay, it may happen once, but that's okay.

Okay. That all said. How else can I prepare myself? What else do you suggest? Reddit. Clinical Researchers - be it if you're a DM, CRA, CRM, CRC, scientist, intern at a sponsor - please, I will take any advice because I *want* this role.

Again, I am so sorry for the length of this. And again, as two years ago I ordered someone a pizza for helping me - I am hoping that somehow Reddit loves when the past comes back as something positive and this team here can help me out. I will take any and all advice.

I know I can own the role. I just need to own the interview. 

Again, thanks Reddit. I hope two years from now I buy another pizza when I'm interviewing for my next role in this industry. Let's make it a tradition. See you then?



THANKS AGAIN. LOVE Y'ALL.

EDIT: Last night instead of studying - I relaxed. I felt like learning when I was on an adrenaline high was not the best. So instead I did self care and watched EEAAO for the 478th time. Feeling more clear headed today and working through all the comments now! Thank you all again researchers!! ‚ô•Ô∏è

EDIT 2: INTERVIEW IS DONE. I literally was horrible at the beginning because I was so nervous but I think I caught myself by midway.

I hate my CRA job,"Guys. I hate this job.
How is it bearable at all?

I am exclusively assigned to the sites that are located in ugly towns 4-5 hours flight away, with multiple time zone changes. My sleep cycles are ruined, basically I can't sleep without pills. My back hurts from the long economy flights and all the sitting in the new and uncomfortable places where they put you to monitor (basement, windowless store rooms, beds at patient wards (!!!). I can't sign up for a gym or a swimming pool, or any kind of class except the weekend ones, or go to a fucking theater, because I never know when I'm going to be out of town. Technically, the time after 8-hour work day should be mine at most jobs, but it's not when I'm taking a late plane or am stuck in some nothing city in my hotel room, watching TV or catching up on emails and missing my boyfriend.

Then, what about the sites? Don't you hate it that we can't do anything by ourselves? You can't fix the chart, or the log, or another kind of paper that is completed incorrectly (lord knows there are a few of those). You have to call your CRC or SI or PI and stand over their shoulder showing them where to sign and what's wrong and how to fix it. They put the wrong date in because they never pay attention, and back to square one. They expect a word-by-word citing of what they should write in source, otherwise you're a bad CRA, even though it's them who were at the patient visit and how do I know what even happened? They don't know the protocol and call you to clarify things that are in the fucking protocol. They have a million excuses why things don't get done, but it's your metric that suffers. They are SO BUSY SAVING LIVES, but then why did they sign up for clinical research projects in the first place? And got paid for doing it?

200 emails a day. ""I just want to follow up regading this request."" Bitch you wrote me at 9 am, and I'm on-site for another sponsor, and now it's 4 pm but you following up already?! Other people in the CRO coming to you for anything related to the sites, from contact/budget questions (hello? Do I look like a paralegal to you?) to assistants asking you to ask the sites at what time can they receive a shipment (just call them, dammit, do you think your head is going to explode if you talk to Her Majesty CRC yourself?).

Can you tell I'm fed up? I'm probably quitting after the bonus. Anyone else?",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/ln8fvb/i_hate_my_cra_job/,clinicalresearch,-0.9997249245643616

If one instance of omission is found, CRA and CRC will be fined 200 yuan. If two instances of omission are found, CRA and CRC will be fined 500 yuan. If three instances of omission are found, CRA and CRC will be fined 1000 yuan.

"My favorite posts here: Travel tips, packing, faves.","The title is it. Those are literally my favorite posts in this group, I love when people share their favorites, no matter what it is. I find it so helpful to come here and have such a resource from people who do this day in and day out and know what actually works, what‚Äôs worth the $, how to eat healthy and save your perdiem, and all the ins and outs of the CRA travel lifestyle.

So update me, what you rockin‚Äô, eatin‚Äô, rollin‚Äô, draggin‚Äô, listenin‚Äô, and all the other verbs to these days for travel success? I want specifics!

Here are mine- some of these came from a lot of personal travel experience prior to being a new CRA, some from your previous advice. (Thanks!)

1: I recently got a lounge membership via a credit card, which allows me to use the lounge when I fly within the alliance. I have found this invaluable. Free food, free ESPRESSO, free alcohol, (if you aren‚Äôt actually working). The bathrooms are nicer and accessible, it‚Äôs quiet with less unhinged children and airport weirdos who don‚Äôt know how to act right, and if something goes wrong with your plane, you can rebook way faster in the lounge. That is my greatest rec of all time. A lounge membership may seem like a lot of money upfront, but if you think of how much you would spend in an airport on any of these given items on any given trip, you can easily spend $50 at every airport just buying a bottle of water and a small meal.

2: Humangear stax interlocking containers. Perfect for snacks, protein powders, toiletries, or ‚Äúborrowing snacks‚Äù from the lounge for the plane (I miss when peanuts were a thing- [eff off pretzels and biscoff cookies!]

3: Foldable usb fan- supplies you air for those planes that keep you on the tarmac in the hot heat with little AC for way too long. And also supplies you with white noise for sleeping at the hotel, or airflow for anti-stagnant air warriors like myself.

4: GUM folding travel toothbrush on Amazon is on another level. So compact, but breathes, and handle folds out to the size of a regular one.

5: Viewsonic travel monitor - it‚Äôs lightweight, built in stand, and charges and connects through only 1 usb-c cord.

6: Open to new travel backpack recs, but I love a backpack with a secondary opening. I have a couple of backpacks, but I will never go without having a top opening AND one that either goes down the front or the side so that I can access everything in the backpack without having to go through just the top and take things out.

7: Seint makeup palette for the ladies. The amount I minimized makeup packing is for real!

8: Nite Ize Runoff waterproof toiletry bag. Legit waterproof though, there are only about 2 on the market. I will never go without mine. Find at Amazon or REI. It has saved my clothes twice from body wash ‚Äòsplosion already.

9‚Äì just an additional tip to top it off, and we can call this an ‚Äúoff duty‚Äù tip. When I‚Äôm premium or above, I get a vodka or gin and soda/seltzer. I always ask for the tru packets (grapefruit is best). Get 1 packet per mini bottle, open just the corner and pour 1 packet inside the bottle and shake to flavor, then use it to mix. :) it‚Äôs so much better than trying to balance how much powder is in your packet vs cup!",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/164xjbb/my_favorite_posts_here_travel_tips_packing_faves/,clinicalresearch,0.9712816476821899

"Tell us your favorite resources, chrome extensions, apps, and tools that make your job easier? ","I‚Äôll start:

- ChatGPT: May be controversial, but if used responsibly and smartly, it‚Äôs an incredibly powerful tool. 
One of the most common ways I use it is to ask it to cite where I can find guidelines in the CFR and ICH GCP for a specific topic. BUT, you always have to verify what it spits out. Don‚Äôt ever blindly trust the info it gives. It‚Äôs also great at helping to brainstorm possible solutions for challenges, and at providing Excel formulas if you tell it what you want to do. 

- Tango.us: This chrome extension automatically creates step-by-step guides for using any web-based site, with screenshots and instructions. For example, if you want to provide someone a step-by-step guide on how to use your company‚Äôs expense system, you just open Tango and click ‚Äústart capture‚Äù and then start submitting your expenses. Tango will systematically create screenshots, with the buttons you clicked circled in orange, and it adds the instructions above each screenshot (e.g. ‚ÄúClick Submit‚Äù). You can then edit the output to change the screenshots and the instructions, and add further details as needed. You can share the guides within Tango or you can print PDFs and even download the HTML version of the guide. 

- Password Manager: this is a MUST HAVE in this industry with all the logins we use. Allows you to save your passwords and automatically populate them into sites, apps, etc. Works across devices, including your computer and smartphone. 
There‚Äôs a million different managers out there, each with their own pros and cons. I use LastPass, but some people prefer other managers because LastPass has had a number of issues (such as breaches). 

- Adobe PRO: I personally can‚Äôt live without Adobe PRO, but it is a bit expensive. Some companies will provide it to you, but others won‚Äôt or won‚Äôt without justification. 
It provides the ability to easily edit documents, convert to word, convert scanned pages into searchable text, and to easily redact information from documents.

"""Patient"" vs ""Subject""","Rave EDC release 2024.1.0 includes the update to replace all instances of ""subject"" to ""patient"" throughout the EDC, ""to view them in a more humanized way"".

So I guess this raises the issue of terminology. I am aware that there's some discourse on the topic but I'm not super familiar with it. Personally, I generally use the generic term ""subject"" because not everyone who enrols in a study is guaranteed to be a patient strictly speaking, i.e., they could be healthy volunteers. But I'm always open to changing my mind.

For those of you who work at sites, I'm sure you're much more likely to refer to them as patients. I'm interested to read everyone's perspectives, especially from different roles. Let me know!

I'm either going to get fired or I'm going to quit,"Advice needed:

I expect to be fired within the next 60 days. I've been working as a CRC/CRA (they do the same thing where I work) since June and I've been making far too many mistakes (things like using the wrong tubes for a visit, entering numbers incorrectly, forgetting to update data charts, etc). 

My coworker, who blatantly doesn't like me because of my repeated errors and points out every mistake I make, has been assigned to watch me and now shadow all my patient visits to ensure that I don't mess up again. 

I leave work on the verge of tears and wanting to quit. This job has not been what I expected and my PI admitted that I'm not a good fit but is extending the probation period. During this time, I've been applying to other jobs like mad but I dread going into work every day and having to deal with being disliked and expected to fail. 

I considered myself detail-oriented up until this job but it's made me lose so much confidence in myself. It seems like you need to border on obsessive to succeed in this role and while I've improved a lot, it's still not enough. When things are good, they're good, but when they're bad, they're awful, and I'm afraid I won't be able to make it through the next 60 days.

I am the only person in our research ‚Äúdepartment‚Äù and my boss/PI/owner is becoming shady,"I work at a smaller clinic (for the past 7 months) who has about 4 employees, including me and the PI. I am currently a ‚Äúlead‚Äù CRC at a company doing 3 clinical trials with 3 different companies. I was told that they would be bringing someone else on to help me a few months ago, but we were all sat down by the PI (owner) and told we were on a 90 day probation period because we (well me) wasn‚Äôt bringing in enough patients for studies. The clinic does other things such as neurology consult, botox, etc for migraines but all our income really comes from me..research. We don‚Äôt have much clientele due to us not taking insurance. 

I‚Äôm the one recruiting, pre-screening, all visits, bloodwork, paperwork, IRB things, speaking to monitors, just EVERYTHING. This is all for 3 different studies all involving pediatric subjects, which has made it extremely hard to recruit.

Lately my boss (PI) has become EXTREMELY anal about us getting paid for every single little penny. They even yelled at me for not knowing all three protocols to a T by heart with no hesitations. I know all of them decently well, but not to their liking now. I‚Äôve become extremely overwhelmed since we added this third study and I told them about this. I asked for help and they said we didn‚Äôt have the money. I forgot to do a 2 week follow up call on a subject and was ripped a new one (I made the call a day late). No one else in the office except for the PI knows about research.

The PI and sub I (their husband) are never in office either. I have had many opportunities to get people in but they aren‚Äôt here. They are alway on vacations.

I decided to look into where our research money is going since they are saying we‚Äôre tight on cash and saw that a total of $200,000 was transferred into their personal account. I have all this access because I handle the budgeting and everything too. My boss and their husband are currently on a two week vacation around Europe yet their business is struggling? They are both VERY flashy rich people who love to flex money.

Im worn out from not having the help we apparently can‚Äôt afford, I‚Äôm starting to make mistakes now, and I‚Äôm worried that this company is just going in the shitter because they keep telling us ‚Äúwe don't have the money‚Äù.

Always in a rush?,"I‚Äôve been working in this field over 4 years now and today i was ‚Äúenlightened‚Äù with the thought that everything and everyone seems to be in a rush all the time.

All the queries, all the enrollment, all the Visits, all the Monitoring‚Ä¶

Dealing with rude CRA (long post warning),"I‚Äôm a newish site coordinator and have loved working with all of my CRAs so far. However, a new CRA is causing a lot of conflict. We actually got into an argument and I‚Äôm not entirely sure if I‚Äôm in the right.

The CRA is generally kind when talking about our personal lives. But during examination of my site‚Äôs files during RMVs, she becomes very adversarial. I feel like I‚Äôm getting interrogated by the FBI with the way she asks questions. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs trying to always get me for something and it makes me super uncomfortable. When I told her no AEs happened since the last time she came, she said ‚ÄúHmmm that doesn‚Äôt sound right, my other sites have lots of AEs‚Äù. ????? Girlie, we only have two patients, of course you are going to get more AEs at other sites with 10+ patients.

In the past monitoring visit, she came to me with the delegation log and lectured me about the ethics of backdating. She pointed towards a date that my old colleague wrote when she ended her tasks and claimed it was me who backdated (wasn‚Äôt even my handwritingüò≠). I clarified the situation and I let it go. 

She also said that the following PDs need to be reported to the IRB and put them as an action item: failed to reconsent patient before a visit, out of window IP dose, out of window visit, and missed IP dose.

To clarify, this study involves dialysis patients. And the IP is administered weekly, and ‚Äúevery effort should be made to ensure this‚Äù. 

Well my contingent manager visited me and he told me they didn‚Äôt need to be reported because they did not pose a significant safety risk to the patients. So I followed his direction. I later confirmed with the PI that these PDs did not put the patient(s) at a greater risk.

Now at my recent monitoring visit, things got a bit hairy. After going through binders for a bit, she asked me if I took information out of a dialysis record and reprinted it. I immediately told her that I didn‚Äôt and even if I wanted to, I can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt have permissions to edit dialysis records, and these edits are documented anyways. She told me that two medication orders are no longer in the entry, but were present at the last visit. Well, I asked her to clarify the date and everything. Turns out, she was in the wrong. The medications were on a different date. She apologized a lot, but I was fed up with being accused of things that could get me fired and also her attitude, so I didn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay‚Äù like I usually do.

She then asked if I reported the PDs from the last visit to the IRB. I stated that the PDs were not reportable. This is when shit hit the fan. She said that she didn‚Äôt think so and I cited the manual. She interrupted me repeatedly when I was trying to explain the manual. I mentioned that a couple PDs happened in one of my site‚Äôs other studies with the same IRB, and the other CRA said they were not reportable. She accused me of only listening to the other CRA and not reading the manual when I did. I end up showing her the manual and unfortunately, the criteria is a little vague. The term ‚Äúinitial‚Äù to me insinuates the first consent, but she believes that it‚Äôs every consent.

Looking back, I realize I should have emailed her about what is reportable and what isn‚Äôt before the visit. Probably would have avoided what happened.

But we keep going back and forth, and her tone gets angrier and angrier. It felt like she always had to be on ‚Äútop‚Äù. I told her that she cannot talk to me that way when she was getting meaner. She disregarded this comment and said ‚ÄúIf you are not reporting these PDs, I will report your site to the IRB‚Äù. I shouldn‚Äôt have done this but I laughed. She stormed out and concluded the visit with an awkward tone.

I told everything to the PI and department head. The PI is on my side and told me he will contact higher ups if she says anything directly to him. It‚Äôs weird because she is only rude to me, to everyone else she is kind. I also reached out to the IRB coordinator to get everything clarified.

I‚Äôm 23 years old and of course I‚Äôm going to think I‚Äôm right in this situation because I‚Äôm young. I want to make sure that I‚Äôm not overlooking things. From my experience, CRAs are very helpful and serve to be almost like ‚Äúolder siblings‚Äù. To me, her way of questioning and accusing seems very unprofessional. She could have asked me where the two medications were instead of accusing me of falsifying data. She could have asked me who wrote the end date for my colleague instead of accusing me of backdating.

EDIT: IRB coordinator got back to me and said none of the events are reportable‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm confused because many of you are saying a missed reconsent is reportable.

**EDIT 2: NONE OF PD‚ÄôS WERE REPORTABLE!!!! CRA EMAILED ME BACK!!!

‚ÄúI confirmed with the CRM that the PD‚Äôs are not considered important‚Ä¶‚Äù

Regarding ICF:
‚ÄúSince the most recent was only an administrative change and not safety related, it is not an important PD. We would just ask to document in the subject source the reason why they were not reconsented at their visit.‚Äù**",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/18mqsc4/dealing_with_rude_cra_long_post_warning/,clinicalresearch,-0.9972923398017883

i‚Äôve been a crc for one month. is this normal?,"In my first week I watched our boss tell my coworker to make up numbers so our site could pass pre-screening. I also learned that my boss somehow thought i had a masters degree and loads of experience in drug trials, because she didn‚Äôt read my resume properly. my coworker believes she only heard buzz words during the interview, like IRB, centrifuge, and research and ran with it. 

Week 2, during an SIV, my boss messaged me privately that weeks before she created a CITI account under my name and completed my GCP cert, bc the site monitor had asked for it. i took a screenshot of this message, just in case. 

Week 3, i learned just how little my boss knows about anything ‚Äúclinical‚Äù or ‚Äúresearch‚Äù related when she tried to get us to screen a subject who is on dialysis, and frequently contradicts herself and throws my coworker and i under the bus for it. she told me in the interview process that she doesn‚Äôt know much about ‚Äúclinical‚Äù work, so don‚Äôt ask her about it, but is now upset that i didn‚Äôt ask her my questions first.

Week 4, i learned that my boss (family to the ceo) and the ceo have zero clinical experience and no science degree. i was told by my coworker to ‚Äútreat (our boss) like a kindergartner‚Äù, because that‚Äôs truly how little she knows about clinical research, but you can‚Äôt be too obvious that you‚Äôre dumbing things down for her, because she also has a bit of an ego. my boss is also upset that i‚Äôm not picking up the job as quickly as she expected. i still don‚Äôt think she understands that who she thought she hired and who she hired are two different people. and she definitely doesn‚Äôt understand what being a coordinator is like. at all. 

that being said, i know i have been doing a really good, thorough job while also improving things like the screening and recruitment process, but all my good work is going unnoticed by my boss. (not my coworker though. they are encouraging and a great teacher) instead, my boss is upset at our screen fails and has started going over our heads and doing our jobs, but is making things worse because she doesn‚Äôt know how to do our jobs and won‚Äôt admit it. we are taking the fall for her mistakes. 

TLDR: i‚Äôm brand new to clinical research and my boss is shady and unprofessional but i don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs expected or not

i hope this makes sense, im still new to the work so it‚Äôs hard to explain concisely what‚Äôs going on. how bad is it? is this normal? what isn‚Äôt normal?

UPDATE:
thank you all for your insight and advice and encouragement. due to the issues with the GCP, (basically my boss made a CITI account under my name and did all the training, and didn‚Äôt tell me), i reported it, and the evidence, to the fda, sponsor and site monitor. i am not going back. it sucks, i worked so hard and was so excited to be here, and i was loving it, but you all, and my family, are right,it‚Äôs too risky, working for someone so ethically gray and working as a GCP trained coordinator when i am, definitely, not.

"I'm about to start Clinical Research Fastrack while it's online and less expensive. I'll update my experiences here. If you'd like, AMA.","A few months ago I decided to take the plunge on Clinical Research Fastrack. My course starts in 5 days! Unless I have to sign an NDA or something, I'll talk about how it goes here.

Some background: I first found the program a year ago. I liked that their hire rate is very good, that they have hiring assistance, and that it sounded like their students tend to be more prepared employees. However, $10k was way too expensive for me, so I passed it over. But right now their classes are $6500, all online, and you don't have to travel to where they're being held like you usually do. The externship is also no longer a requirement now; I don't think you really need that anyway. To me, those things made it worth it and I decided to go for it.

(If you're considering calling them for more information, Debbie was particularly good about explaining the several payment plan options very clearly. I mention this because I've run into a couple other people who had other staff members assigned to them and ended up confused about money options, and I just ended up sending them the information she gave me. Her direct number is 602-777-7485.)

\*\*\*

Some background on me: I have a B.S. in Biology, worked in 3 different research labs in college, and worked in oilfield chemistry labs for 4 years, including one that tendered projects for the entire northern hemisphere. I've also worked as a national remote dispatcher, and (after the pandemic hit) on teams figuring out how to turn their live experiences into remote ones. I've done tech writing, copywriting, UI design, mobile app creation, and graphic design in both technical and recreational fields. I've also done some fun stuff like character acting and public speaking - unsurprisingly, I enjoy being client-facing. A longstanding big-ticket item on my bucket list is ""contribute somehow to the advancement of the medical field"", but whatever field, I'm happiest when I'm helping smooth the process of moving innovation forward.

\*\*\*

Update 10/5:

I got my prestudy in last Friday. The content apparently used to be mailed, but it's all online now. There's a lot of class material they ask us to print, and about 12 hours' worth of pre-study modules to complete before the course starts.

Today, I had a meeting with some of the staff members and some other students to make sure we understood how to use Zoom.

\*\*\*

Update 10/10:

First day went well! The instructors, all of whom work in the field, are friendly, informative, brilliant, and even more relatable than I expected. I ... am so tired.

\*\*\*

Update 10/16:

I promise I'm still alive!

This class is INTENSE but extremely good, very well organized, and aside from the breaks (the last 5 to 15 minutes of every hour of each 10-hour day) there is no downtime or slow time. Every one of the instructors has expressed a wish that this kind of program had been around when they were first starting out, and how much of a hidden gem this field is. They have all had very different specialties and backgrounds.

One of the students in my class has already been contacted by someone who is leaving her position and looking for a replacement. Pretty much all of us have leads for places to apply. The career coaching, which happens between subjects about twice or three times a day, is hands down the best I've ever experienced.

More later, sleep calls!

\*\*\*

Update 10/19:

The in-class part is over, and I took a day to rest and relax. Now for 68 more hours of self-paced post-study!

My overall assessment is: I've loved it. I can safely say I'm now well-prepared to start a career in clinical research. There is a small mountain of rules, regulations, acronyms, forms, etc. that people don't get hired for these positions without, and I have an in-depth understanding and working knowledge of those now. (My prior background helps, but I couldn't have walked into this field on just that. In fact, this class made me realize why a job I was fascinated with and excited about years ago never called me back after the interview - because I didn't know \*literally this stuff\*.)

Like I mentioned, every instructor and guest speaker is from the field, in a range of different companies and roles, all very engaging, interactive, personable and sharp as tacks, and they all said they wished a course like this had been around when they were new.

On top of this, the career coaching has been, and continues to be, the best I've ever had. They helped us and continue to help us with our resumes, LinkedIn profiles, interview strategies, and internal referrals from companies to apply for. Within less than two days of finishing the course, I have a Google spreadsheet full of leads for jobs I would be \*thrilled\* to get, at companies where I already know someone personally.

I'm torn between wishing I'd done this years ago and being glad I waited until it was less expensive, but either way, I'm VERY glad I went for it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/j5qdxm/im_about_to_start_clinical_research_fastrack/,clinicalresearch,-0.9945670366287231

To Struggling CRCs,"I‚Äôve been seeing so many CRCs start threads here about how they are struggling in their positions and making many mistakes on the job. I was a CRC for several years before going on to project management and working at a CRO. Here are some tips:

1. Use job aids! No one is asking you to memorize the protocol, especially if you‚Äôre on several at once. Print off the important things like the schedule of events or sample collection schedule and laminate them or put them in a folder to have during visits. Utilize visit checklists too (if your source docs don‚Äôt include them, consider making them). There is no shame in referring to a table to be sure. But do continue to review your protocols on a regular basis when you can find the time. 

2. Ask! If you don‚Äôt know, if you can‚Äôt find it in the protocol, ASK! Please please please ask your questions. Don‚Äôt guess. And if you think you need additional training or re-training on something, ask for that too. 

3. Consider using electronic notes instead of paper. Tools like OneNote or Trello can be your best friend. You can pull them up on the go on your phone or laptop if you‚Äôre in an another building/office with your participant and it‚Äôs searchable. Definitely beats flipping through pages of a paper notebook trying to find that one thing you wrote down from the SIV or your meeting two weeks ago. 

4. Be accountable! If you made a mistake, it is not the end of the world so long as you alert the PI (or your manager), get it documented, and get it fixed. Don‚Äôt try and hide things. That‚Äôs a fast way to lose trust and probably your job.

5. Prepare your visit materials ahead of time. At the end of the week, you have a good idea of the participants on the schedule for next week. Take some time to go ahead and print off and organize what you might need, label it and set it aside so you‚Äôre ready to go the following week. 

6. Pay attention to how long it takes you to do things. This is important so you don‚Äôt over promise what you can do to the PI or to the CRA and then get in a panic or in hot water when time starts running out. Be transparent. If you need three days to get data entered it‚Äôs better they know that upfront.

Hiring managers: Pandemic clinical research employment scam?,"I work on the sponsor side and run a large team of site managers/monitors.  Early in the pandemic we switched our recruiting and hiring process to be almost entirely virtual - interviews over videocalls instead of in-person.  We hired a ton of people over 2020-2022 and in hindsight realized that we had been victims of a scam with several of our hires.

Basically we'd have people interview who met all of the criteria on paper (good resume and experience) and who seemed to interview well, though sometimes their camera would be blurry or didn't work.  Sometimes they claimed a delay in hearing our questions, which resulted in them pausing before answering us.  We think that someone was beside them or whatever, feeding them the responses to the questions, and in some cases we think that the person we interviewed is not the same as the person who showed up for the job.

It took us several weeks and in a few cases, several months to realize that these candidates were not actually qualified at all.  Because their first month or so was basically training, mostly online, and then they spent time co-monitoring or shadowing for the next few months, their complete incompetence wasn't totally revealed right away.  It has been super frustrating, time consuming and expensive to resolve, especially when we spend months recruiting/interviewing/hiring/training people and then have to spend even more time to document their incompetence well enough to be able to terminate them.  

We realized this trend once these employees were proving to be unqualified, but it was certainly eye-opening to see how easy it was for people to be sneaking in under the radar - especially for big companies.  I haven't heard of this as an issue in other industries, but I assume that someone put together that a role which is often 100% remote + a change in interview processes due to the pandemic would equal a unique opportunity to make some easy money.

Morale in industry not recovering?,"I have been a CRC for almost five years and I feel that since the pandemic began, morale has been continually going downhill with no end in sight. My encounters with CRAs and other representatives from CROs and sponsors have become increasingly more adversarial and exhausting. For instance, more than ever am I having ‚Äúurgent‚Äù requests issued, ranging from issuing queries the day of a data cut and badgering the CRC and PI to resolve during the same day, to e-mailing daily asking for updates as to when contract negotiations for an upcoming study will be completed, despite me repeatedly indicated that this is out of my control and handled by a different office at my institution (only to have the CRO state that they do not hear back from the contracts office and I am more responsive). What is even more frustrating is that while I do my best to respond to numerous ‚Äúurgent‚Äù requests as timely as I can, the same is often not done by those with CROs. An example of this is we called and sent numerous e-mails to various team members for a study to verify I/E, and we only heard back from someone six hours after initial contact on a weekday during business hour and had to wait another 24 hours to have I/E verified, putting us at serious risk of being out of window for eligibility. 

Things are stressful enough as it is for everyone, and while I feel some CROs are better than others, the overall tone from the industry side seems to be to project stress and terseness and be unrelenting in demands. I have seen CRAs on here complain about an increase in sites that have been difficult to work with, so I am not sure if that is what is causing this overall negativity to rise.

IQVIA layoffs: seeking general advice ,"Howdy! 

New to this sub reddit, so hello! As may or may not have been discussed, with the announcement of IQVIA laying off 30% of its US based clinical trial payments teams, unfortunately I was impacted. I've been with IQVIA for going on two and a half years with stellar performance reviews as an analyst (contracts and invoice payment), but regrettably I think the decision is entirely based on money and geographic region to decide who they laid off. 

That being said, I'd love to stay in CT, but I'm a loss at where to even start looking, prior to this my background was in retail management for about 8 years. I do have a college degree in Pol Sci, and was looking at pursuing my masters in the clinical trials space. 
Does anyone have any advice on what would I even be qualified for at other CROs? Or even in academic settings. My experience mostly is in data entry and payments, obviously with a hand in the customer service site facing role. 

Thank you for any advice you might have! It is a real let down that the company has chosen to prioritize its hiring solely away from US bases. As I explained to the individual who spoke to me about layoff, it shows the companies lack of commitment to longevity of employees who have provided stable work for x number of years just simply due to a cost factor associated to US based pay.

Venting - Site not entering data,"A little vent here from the sponsor side. We have an interim DBL that is on the critical path for this whole program - meaning we can't move forward without it. We have one site that has been behind on data entry for months. We have been pushing them to get caught up for months and provided milestones and strategies to overcome the backlog. They have said ""we will get caught up"" over and over. They agreed to plans set in place by the CRO, but they have not ever actually done what they said they were going to do. 

We they missed the critical deadline and now every day they don't catch up is a delay in the drug development. I am getting asked every single day where they are and what we are doing to hit the milestone. I have said 100000 times that we can't enter the data for them or reply to their queries. I have offered additional budget, even paying them a one off amount and looked into sending contract data entry support to the site - but they won't act on any of these things. 

We put them on an enrollment hold (at long last) and they got all upset that their patient's wouldn't have access to treatment (oncology open label) - but they STILL haven't done the work they need to do!!! I have no earthly idea how they thought they could handle MORE patients.

Burnt Out and Broke,"Hi everyone,
I am feeling really frustrated with the pay for clinical research work. I have been a coordinator for 2 years in academia, regulatory coordinator for 1 in academia, worked in industry after market compliance for 1.5 (the people and role sucked), and am back in academia for 6 months doing a mix of everything above.

Manager accidentally sent me a document discussing me and my ‚Äúissues‚Äù,"For some background, I have been with a mid sized CRO for a little over a year as a CTM. I started as an associate and was quickly promoted to my current role. This company is‚Ä¶.toxic to say the least and has had several issues with turnovers.

So before the holiday, I mistakenly received an email from my direct manager with a document titled ‚Äú[my name] - documentation request for [director]‚Äù. It was about 4 pages long and discussed issues and challenges I was having in my current position as a CTM (or basically things that my manager and I discuss on our weekly 1:1). Things like my workload, challenges I‚Äôm having with other departments, etc. At first, I just assumed this was just a report she sends weekly/biweekly to the director. 

However, I combed through it again and there are screenshots and listing ‚Äúissues‚Äù and noting things that I‚Äôve done wrong. Some of these items are things like ‚Äúnot responding to an email‚Äù or ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt send out meeting minutes‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know why my director would need to know things that are this‚Ä¶.inconsequential??

I am very confused by this and would like to know opinions on how to move forward. I fear the worst as this is looking more like a case against me since everything on the document was negative. I am looking at other positions at the moment but I do not want to leave in a bad foot.

UPDATE: we‚Äôll this got interesting. Lo and behold I met with my manager a couple days later (and recorded it). She apologized profusely and said that the director asked her for documentation on me when I was on PTO‚Ä¶.on my honeymoon. The director said I didn‚Äôt follow a PTO policy of notifying her two weeks before I left. w This issue is that this PTO policy does not exist, so I pushed back politely disagreeing with her that I can‚Äôt follow a policy that does not exist nor was I given the directive to do so. Mind you I took this time off in June and left for PTO in December. Everyone on my team knew I was leaving! Anyway, she didn‚Äôt like that I disagreed with her and decided to conspire against me while I was away. She ultimately submitted that document to HR.

Well, HR didn‚Äôt do anything nor did they follow up. She continues to tell my manager to collect documentation on me in case I ‚Äúmess up‚Äù. Oh, did I mention things she noted had nothing to do with the quality of my projects lol

What‚Äôs the best way to respond?,"Edit: I genuinely meant to ask a question but this may have turned into a vent :( 

I do start up at the hospital site. I get sponsor and CRO reps with perceived ideas about their ability to direct my time and attention that just do not have any grounding in reality.  They‚Äôll set deadlines for me (without providing explanation why and clear implications being they‚Äôre trying to force me to match their desired timelines) and make demands and requirements of me.  They‚Äôll write sentences in bold and italicized text and in a rainbow of colorful fonts, and otherwise  communicate with me in ways that in any other context would appear unhinged. They talk down to me and often seem to not even read my responses.  

It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre blind to the following: they are not my boss. They have no control over me.  Sometimes we don‚Äôt even have a contract in place yet such that my group can count on payment from them for the work they‚Äôre asking of me. They are only one of 35 different studies I‚Äôm working on. They‚Äôre internal SOP‚Äôs aren‚Äôt necessarily my responsibility if it falls outside general good CR practice. I‚Äôve already communicated to them about the issue, and no, I won‚Äôt provide them updates every other day on each of the 60 items I‚Äôm handling to get a study from implementation to activation.  Also, fuck you very much for implying I‚Äôm lazy and need to be controlled and wrangled, rather than recognizing the obvious: we are massively overworked and underpaid and I literally cannot help everyone according to their requested timelines even if I didn‚Äôt sleep and worked 24/7. Also that thing you want me to do? It requires the cooperation of 4 other folks, each of whom I only ever email with, and they‚Äôre usually seeing patients and not checking email. 

I‚Äôm super salty and irritated right now. Yesterday on an SIV, a CTM joined and actually asked if they could contact one our clinical departments to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù (read ‚Äúapply pressure‚Äù bc there is literally nothing could do to actually help) speed up a nitpicky implementation process that required cooperation from multiple sub departments.

Need of union or committee for CRA's rights in clinical research,"Oflately, I am experiencing a shift in clinical research industry where there is a lots of responsibilities/accountability put on CRA.

First, CRAs are overburdened where they are expected (UnOficially) to be on site around 12 days (average) and maintain the metrics of reports and issues. Although, officially they say 5 MVs but when all the fellow CRAs are travelling 12 days on site (7-8 MVs, some being 2days), you can't choose to travel only for 5 days. 

Second, no appreciation or acknowledgement on what you have been doing, instead, you are asked at each 1:1 meeting why this and why that metrics not met. No incentives what so ever. 

Third, so many audits are coming up and no additional time offered to CRA to manage these audits. If auditors are silly, they would raise heaps of major critical issues. Then, you would be judged by COL, LM, DIRECTORS, HEADS and what not. And if it's FDA audit, whole world goes to  site and start scutenizing/asking questions. No one remembers you were not given time to deliver quality at the site. CRAs keep getting emails and phone calls on site and apparently, all are urgent. 

Should we have some kind of union to define maximum number of MVs allowed for CRAs. 

No work life balance what so ever. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1ez8t29/need_of_union_or_committee_for_cras_rights_in/,clinicalresearch,-0.9987016916275024

CRC Here. Am I stupid? ,"I graduated with honors from a pre-med program and I am so sick of feeling stupid every day as a CRC. I was a great student my entire life and research is very much the field that I always wanted to get into but my education prepared me almost not at all for a career in this field and my institution's training was severely lacking in so many ways. I feel like this job requires a super human level or attention to detail and ability to work at high speeds that are in direct opposition with one another and I am starting to feel like they come down to personal attributes that maybe I just don't have. I know that I have a lot more medical knowledge than many of my peers but it seems like the people around me who excel are just really good at bureaucratic tasks and processes and come from fields like English and Communication. 

Am I the only one that feels this way or is this field maybe just not for me? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1couhh6/crc_here_am_i_stupid/,clinicalresearch,-0.9974719882011414

Sites complaining about DM.,"I've been lurking on this sub for the most part and I just like to observe and one thing I would like to just get off my chest is the sheer amount of complaints I see about Data Managers from sites and I want to just illuminate what we go through so to inform how much we go through on a daily basis. It might appear at the surface that we don't do anything or we're dumb and we query all the time but it's not so simple. Just like coordinators have to handle so much, so do we. I've come from a lab and coordinator background before I became a DM. I know the pressure and stress from both sides very intimately which is why when things happen between sites and DM, I don't take it so hard or get upset so readily because I empathetically understand what sites are going through. 

DMs at my CRO are basically the project managers. We handle everything and have to talk to everyone in every functional group. It's not like some functional groups where they can silo and sometimes talk to DM and the PL. No, we talk to EVERYONE because the system touches every functional area. We have to talk to Stat for reporting, analysis, and data. We have to talk to CRAs for their monitoring reports and any monitoring discrepancies. We talk to Safety for their reporting and system requirements for AE reporting. We talk to TMF for our documents. We talk to the Project Leaders for DM related items. We talk to the developers for the system build and give the requirements. We talk to programmers for customizations. The list goes on. And above all, we have to talk to everyone because we're the SMEs when it comes to the system so everyone including sites and sponsors come to us and even ask protocol questions. On top of all this, like coordinators we have multiple protocols or projects we're assigned so multiply all of this by however many people we interact with. 

Just wanted to help inform coordinators before I see another, ""DMs are dumb. What are they doing? They just query and are asking stupid questions."" I think it's unfair and unkind to just jump to conclusions about a group of people before you understand what is going on below surface.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1chopad/sites_complaining_about_dm/,clinicalresearch,-0.9976282715797424
Why does conducting a SIV have to be so frustrating?,"
I've been experiencing immense frustration with SIVs, and I wonder if others share the sentiment. It's incredibly disheartening to spend an entire day explaining the protocol, addressing any Site inquiries, and ensuring everyone understands their procedures, only for everything to fall apart after randomizing the first patient 

The Sites assure us that everything will run smoothly according to protocol, that the PI will be present (lol), and that they have no lingering questions. Yet, suddenly, it feels like I'm in a control room with every panel flashing red.

Worst day ever. Help please.,"I used to work at the bedside and today was almost as bad as my best day at the bedside. 
I have no idea what I should do. 

Job 1: my current job as a clinical research nurse. $76k at a large academic site but in a rare disease. Less than 1 year experience. I am the only coordinator on 11+ studies. I do receive help with regulatory work, but the PI doesn‚Äôt know how to do basically anything so I am doing the majority of the work. Current commute is 25 mins by train. My boss is very easy going and will approve vacation time without even looking at it. They will pretty much give me whatever I ask for within reason and they don‚Äôt micromanage me. I also love my coworkers. On the other hand, the PI lacks does micromanage me and is constantly throwing more work at me. She also has me do simple tasks that she can do herself. I work very closely with her and she drives me insane most days. For example, she emailed me telling me to remind her to renew her training. She also asks me to email people with questions that she has and then cc her on the email. It‚Äôs just stupid stuff that she can easily do herself but she asks me instead. 

I am moving out of state with a new commute of 90+ mins. I brought up the possibility of a raise, plus WFH 2 days per week which my boss was agreeable to. They also want me to move into a leadership position later on. However, due to the daunting commute, I recently accepted another job. I read on here that you shouldn‚Äôt tell you boss that you‚Äôre looking for new jobs without having accepted a job due to the possibility of being fired. My boss was completely surprised by the fact that I was resigning. They have known that I‚Äôm moving since March, but was still very surprised and felt blindsided since I had discussed WFH and a raise the previous week. 

Job 2: 15 minute commute by car to a new job I just accepted in my new home state. Job is a clinical study administrator at a large pharmaceutical company. I know nothing about the work flow, work life balance, or management/coworkers. 81k with 10% merit/company performance bonus. 

I gave 4 weeks notice (per company policy for nurses) but for the last two of those weeks, I am on vacation (approved months ago). My boss and HR say that it‚Äôs up to the supervisor/boss whether or not they want to honor the pre approved vacation, disapprove the pre approved vacation so I can work for 4 weeks, Or have me extend my last day to two weeks later. I have already asked the new company if I can start later and they cannot give me any more time. 

My boss is trying to compromise by allowing me to go on my vacation but have me work on the weekends (to help consent patients) until they find and train someone to replace me. Their biggest concern is that there is nobody to do my job right now and patients will suffer from this. 

I am totally confused and today has been the worst day. My PI is pissed off. My boss is disappointed but still wants the best for me and wants me to ‚Äúlearn from this experience‚Äù.

I guess I could‚Äôve communicated better that I was looking for other jobs rather than bringing up the possibility of getting a raise and working from home and then resigning the next week. I feel so terrible about this whole situation. 

Should I stay at my currently job with a great boss and possibility for growth, or should I leave all of this behind (work the weekends) and move on to the new company? 

Also, I have been asking that they hire another person to help me for months now, but it has been put on the back burner. Now that I am leaving, they are hiring 2 people.

I do not want to burn any bridges. 

TLDR: stay as a research nurse 76k, 90 min commute, possible WHF, possible raise, and awesome boss. Or go to new job as clinical study administrator, 81k, 15 min commute, no WFH, don‚Äôt know what the boss is like.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/12tclsf/worst_day_ever_help_please/,clinicalresearch,-0.9859236478805542

I requested a refund stating my complaint & was told that I did not qualify for a refund because I had already logged into my training. They did not address the issue of plagiarism at all. Ultimately I received a refund through my bank after I disputed the charge. I just felt the need to warn others.

You shouldn't bother much with terms or a lot of the flashcards one would find online. I studied these for weeks because I though I would have to know them verbatim but the format of the exam is almost entirely applied scenarios.

-Who is responsible for what in the CFRs and GCP guidelines
 -If X then Y type of scenarios in research
-General rules for study procedures and their exceptions based on CFR and GCP
-Reporting windows and record retention, not just how long but who keeps them in different scenarios. 

What I studied but you shouldn't:

-Specific Terms and Definitions in the CFR guidelines
-CFR Headings, subparts and Sections verbatim
-The lists of the different ethical guidelines like the Nuremberg code, Belmont report, etc (there were MAYBE 3 questions on these out of 130).

Are US Federal grants funding salaries of foreign workers who are replacing our US colleagues?,"I am seeing so many of our American colleagues being laid off and their replacements being in other countries. I‚Äôm worried for our jobs and our industry in the US. What can be done? Is it right that US pays the highest rates for healthcare/medications, where most of these studies are done in the us, but yet our US colleagues working on these studies are being replaced by foreign workers?

I am relatively new to clinical research and don‚Äôt really know much about funding so perhaps some of you can comment, but how many of the studies going on, have funding from the federal government, either partial or full? Are there any stipulations for those receiving this money, such as how may American workers needs to be employed by the study? If not, do you think there should be such a requirement? Or would such a requirement be seen negatively? I don‚Äôt think such a requirement would be detrimental to the study since clearly there is the talent and expertise currently existing in the US.  Or  are the majority of studies 100% privately funded so such stipulations would not really have an impact?

What would the ramifications be if there was a federal law that said studies taking place in US had to employ a certain percentage of American workers or other such requirement (no matter if the companies have received US federal funding or not)? Should we be working on legislation? Should we be talking to our representatives? Do we need to unionize? What can be done?

I would really like to see other opinions and discussion on this topic.

 Edit: thanks for the quality comments that shared their experience and knowledge on this topic. 

To other comments about capitalism, yes of course we know it‚Äôs capitalism and the snark you put into your comments really speaks to you as a person. This post is not asking why it‚Äôs happening, it‚Äôs asking how we can better retain US jobs. There are some rules/regulations on capitalism in the US for various fields (ex farming/banking) and tariffs/taxes, to protect some US industries. So to make the blanket statement ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù is disingenuous and is an attempt at shutting down discussion.

Manager asking if my workload is too much.,"I've been a CRA for under a year at a big CRO. I feel when I do perform I perform well, and have often received good feedback from managers and coworkers on tools I use, letters, and reports. However, I struggle incredibly with time management. I know I have ADHD, but I force myself to try to ignore it. I was on medication in college for it but I don't want to be on that stuff again, I also see a therapist weekly.

I have to write new to-do lists multiple times a week to keep my brain focused, because if I DON'T make lists then I'll think about everything all at once and likely not get anything done. I do have moments of hyper focus, where I can work like a champ, but it also comes with days where I'm dragging myself to even do simple tasks because the mental weight is so high.

I also struggle to work during ""working hours"". Either I am sleeping in or am scrolling on my phone and then I feel guilty so I work late into the night to finish tasks. Or I'll eat dinner and have a little down time before going back to work at nights so I can at least feel like I accomplished something and feel like I'm earning my paycheck.

Anywho. My CTM noticed my letters keep coming at night and is asking if my workload is too much. I feel like it's not too much, I just have issues. But I can't say that? I don't want to get let go...  I feel like my struggle bus is how I roll. I'm only on one study.

Where I fall short in is knowing which documentts to collect onsite and how to spot mistakes in source documents. I've been onboarded pretty quickly with studies and lackluster training at my CRO and I work remotely. It's been weighing on my mind heavily how I'm performing and I just want to be great at my job.

Im a CRA experiencing anxiety/burnout should I quit or wait to get fired,"I have been a CRA for 4 years. The first 3 years were just fine, I was traveling a lot and my oncology workload was manageable and I liked my job. I got switched to a new project a little over a year ago and I‚Äôm hating it. It‚Äôs terrible, so complicated/convoluted; CRAs with decades of experience are trying to get off too. My anxiety levels are extremely high, I have trouble sleeping and sleep poorly. I am always tired and have no energy; my life is consumed by work. I recently took a week off but could not enjoy it; I felt numb, kinda fake interacting with family. I still had reports to finalize/FUL to send while on vacay.  I Also had a really packed week before and after to compensate. How do CRAs manage to take time off? In my last study I did it no problem but this study, I am drowning, I feel Ike I can‚Äôt even try anymore. I cannot make myself complete reports, my on-time metrics are slipping, I just can‚Äôt do it anymore. I asked to get off this project 5 months ago but my manager laughed at me. I told them of my anxiety attacks during visits and they laughed.  I‚Äôm terrified to quit because the field is tough right now for more experienced CRAs, let alone a newer cra like me. 

Is it better if I wait to get fired so I can collect unemployment and take sometime to put myself back together or should I quit now, so for potential future employers, I can be able to tell them I quit vs telling them I was fired?

What exactly does a CRO do?,"
I‚Äôm doing some research for school (a healthcare business class) and wanted some help figuring out - what exactly does a CRO do?

On paper, I get it. Big pharma or biotech have a drug they want to commercialize. There are bunch of rules they have to follow (drug must pass certain regulations) and the drug must pass a clinical research process (Phases I - III). CROs design and run the study (recruit the right people using data as an advantage, track/create datapoints form the study, analyze the data‚Ä¶). I understand that CROs also provide consultants that can help with drug development (ie, heres a smart dude you can ask questions to), although it‚Äôs a smaller part of the business.

But what does your day to day actually look like? From an outsider, running a study doesn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúscience.‚Äù But given how CRO jobs are often compared to pharma jobs, with some people suggesting that the two are similar, I must be missing something.

So you want to be a CRA...,"I see a lot of posts here asking about how to break into being a CRA. I thought I'd share some things I've learned from my own experience and in talking with recruiters, other CRAs, and CRCs I've worked with in the past who have made that jump. I will preface this by saying this is USA specific. I don't have any experience with the CRA process outside of the US (although I have worked with enough Canadian CRAs to know that it is very similar). Sorry ex-US clinical researchers, maybe some one can chime in with more info on that process.

&#x200B;

I became a CRA in 2007 and have worked in research since 2004 as a research assistant, coordinator, CRA, and clinical trial manager but the majority of my experience has been as a CRA. I truly enjoy being a CRA- I like the blend of working from home and also being in the field working with sites.

&#x200B;

**How do I even get someone to give me an interview?** 

First and foremost, the most frustrating part of looking for a CRA position is that every position requires 2+ years of on-site monitoring experience. There never seems to be entry level CRA positions. I get it- I applied for CRA jobs for a year before getting an interview for a monitoring training program at a CRO. 

Your best bet is to take a look at your current career. Do you have strong research experience? Generally, most CRAs come from being a research coordinator or a clinical trial associate. It is unlikely you'll get hired as a CRA without some sort of clinical research background; the exception seems to be foreign medical school grads who do not want to practice in the US. If you are CRC, consider looking at getting a CCRP or CCRC designation to show you have a strong grasp of the practical applications of GCP. Consider what therapeutic areas you work in. Oncology is hot right now...everyone wants an oncology CRA and if CROs realize they won't have to train a new CRA on the fundamentals of oncology, that is more attractive. 

The next piece is where you live. If you live more than a 30-45 minute drive from a major airport (major meaning they can fly a jet out of it), then you are going to have a hard time getting an interview. Sorry. Companies will reimburse the mileage you drive to the airport so if they start to realize that a traveling CRA is going to be driving over a hour to the airport and then incurring higher than normal airfare costs just to get to a site, it's going to be a no-go for them.

Keep applying to CRA positions. Yes, you may not meet their qualifications. But if you do talk to a recruiter, use it to ask if they do hire entry level CRAs. Ask them when they hire them, what therapeutic areas they are recruiting for, and what regions they are looking to hire in. My entry level CRA training program was a class filled with individuals who were on the West Coast (basically west of the Mississippi River) and had oncology experience. There were people who were CRCs and CTAs, internal and external candidates. If you are currently at a CRO and want to be a CRA, talk to your line manager about promotion opportunities. I know that they can be rare but see what you need to distinguish yourself (and I suspect it means hitting deliverables on-time/early). 

Network network network! If you are a CRC, talk to the CRAs that come to your site. Let them know you are interested in being a CRA (but also, make sure you are a rockstar CRC). They often times will be able to make referrals for people. I've done this in the past with CRCs I've worked with, but I'm only going to recommend someone if I know that they excel at being a CRC and I know that they understand what being a CRA entails. Go to ACRP or SoCRA meetings. Again, this is a good way to meet other individuals in the field and there might be local CRA recruiters. Our chapter frequently has individuals from recruiting agencies attend because they are looking to expand their candidate pools. 

&#x200B;

**I got an interview...now what?**

Awesome! Now is the time to shine. If it is a phone interview, I still recommend getting yourself dressed like you'd be seen in person. Why? Because you will have the confidence you'd have knowing you look good. Your first phone interview might be with a recruiter, and they will have limited knowledge of clinical research and the basics beyond what the job description is. That said, they are trying to gauge if you know anything about research and understand if you know what the job entails. Study the job description, read up on the company you interviewing with, etc. They may ask questions like ""What is an adverse event and what makes it serious?"" or ""Tell me about the informed consent process"". Again, use it to tie back to you. If you are a CRC, tell them your perfect ICF process. If you are a CTA, tell them the perfect SAE reporting process. As for asking questions, if this is an entry level CRA job, ask them about training. Ask what home office supplies they might provide (I got a $500 stipend to purchase a desk and filing cabinet for my first CRA job). Ask what the process if for interviewing- when you'll find out if you've gotten a second interview and who it might be with. 

After every interview you need to follow-up. Send an email and tell them it was wonderful to speak with so and so, and you appreciate the opportunity. Be timely with any sort of follow-up they might come back with; this might mean filling out an online application and providing references. Let them know if you will be unavailable, like you're taking a few days off for vacation, etc (and check back in with them after you return!). 

Your next interviews will either be in person, over video conference, or via phone with hiring managers. These individuals know research- they've probably been CRAs, project managers, etc. They will ask more probing questions about your resume and experience. If you have gaps, multiple jobs in a short period of time, etc. be prepared to honestly explain it. They will also ask questions like ""Tell me about a time when you worked with a difficult person"" or ""Tell me about a time when you had multiple competing deadlines"". Again, answer honestly and use your best examples. Maybe you're a CRC and had a truly difficult monitor. Maybe you're a CTA and you had two studies that were in start-up at once. Be as specific as possible without being derogatory. Don't give away study names, sponsors, or the names of sites/individuals. 

&#x200B;

**Holy crap, I got HIRED!**

Yay! Now is the time to start getting details. You'll probably have to do a background check, a drug test, and they will look at references. Again, be timely. Get these things done ASAP so you don't jeopardize your start date. If you need to purchase office equipment, start researching. You'll need a suitcase for traveling- but don't sink money into Tumi or Briggs and Riley without understanding what you like (my favorite carry on is one I got from Costco). 

Read your offer letter! Many companies put in clauses that you are on the hook for expenses, etc. if you quit within x days/weeks/years of your hire date. There might be non-compete clauses as well. Ask yourself...can I do this job and stay here for the next 2 years? Companies can and will go after you if you break those contracts. 

Training class is probably coming up. As an entry level CRA, you will travel because you have observation visits to do. Be flexible- now is not the time to say ""sorry, that's too far"" because the longer you take to do those visits, the longer it takes you to get permanently assigned to studies/sites. Avoid major vacations during your training period. I know of people who have gotten bounced from CRA training programs because they missed to many classes due to vacations. Managers will only be so flexible before they will doubt you are serious. 

&#x200B;

**Should I get a Masters/PhD/Post Grad Certificate?**

The short answer is NO. I have yet to see someone complete a Masters in Clinical Research and get a CRA position. As I said before, experience in Clinical Research is going to take precedence.

Newbie CRA Vent,"Had a not so great site qualification visit today.

Frustration Post :) ,"Hi. I understand that job market is tight, but each time ‚Äûtherapeutic experience‚Äú topic is brought up by recruiters / hiring managers in relation to PM roles - I‚Äòm frustrated as never :) - of course deeply inside :), but anyway.

Maybe you will convince that it‚Äôs indeed relevant but I have over 15 years of experience and at least my experience shows me that PM (especially recently when everything is ‚Äûexpedited‚Äú and ‚Äûcosts-saving‚Äú to the next level) is not about Therapeutic Area. It‚Äôs about managing people and money in most efficient way. 

I personally was working in multiple TAs without any issue and I observed how excellent MDs / PhDs working in their TAs failed as a Project Leads / Project Directors. Because you can be great at particular medical field and it will not give you any advantages in managing huge Team and big money. 

I agree - for Medical Monitoring it‚Äòs requirement. But why companies reject great PLs profiles based on absence of certain TA studies in their portfolio? I think it‚Äôs stupid. What do you think?

2) I‚Äôm sorry the position is on hold OR
3) literally ANYTHING

I have previously been in contacted with another recruiter before and she always answered me. But then she referred me to this other recruiter that has ghosted me multiple times. How do you handle something like this without showing frustration and handling it professionally?

When I originally was applying for a position a few months ago, I didn‚Äôt even know the positions were filled. I wasn‚Äôt given a rejection email or anything.

Anyone transitioned from Clinical operations (Clinical project managers/CTM/Clinical lead) into Clinical Science?,"Would love to read your experience on transitioning from years in clinical operations (especially If doing project management/CTM/clinical lead positions, but also from monitoring) into Clinical Science within the Pharma industry. I am pretty interested in transitioning into Clinical science so as to get more into early development of protocols and more in-depth discussions on molecules and disease rather than focusing so much on finance/resources and administrative tasks (I sometimes feel as a Clinical Lead I am just becoming a generic project manager who could be working in any industry, instead of focusing on the science and medicine which is my highest interest). I¬¥ve been in monitoring and later clinical management positions for almost 10 years now.

Any suggestions on how you made this jump, in which type of company (CRO or Pharma) or any experiences you could tell us about? I understand it is much easier for PhD or MDs to make this transition, but wondering If people with a strong academic background in science can still go into these roles....

I am actually seeing a lot of people transitioning directly from basic science in the lab to AD positions within Clinical science departments in Pharma which is very surprising (as most departments would require 8-10 years in industry to become an AD) so really looking forward to reading your thoughts/experiences!

Thanks everyone!

Additional clarification based on some early responses: What I¬¥m referring to as Clinical science in this case is not Clinical operations (where in a lot of places is basically the whole spectrum of monitors, remote/central monitors, maybe clinical trial assistants as well as ClinOps PMs or Clinical leads/CTMs). I¬¥m referring to non-physician medical teams I'd say, people involved in protocol development, choosing endpoints, analyzing data, contributing to Clinical study reports and regulatory presentations to FDA/EMA/etc from the clinical/scientific perspective. I¬¥ve seen some of them liasing with ClinOps sometimes during the feasibility stages of clinical trials and maybe presenting more scientific aspects of protocols but not involved in trial execution or monitoring usually. I¬¥ve seen this kind of Clinical Scientist or Clinical Science AD in CROs like IQVIA, PPD and Pharma like Roche but I understand to be present in other places as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/xxmzfp/anyone_transitioned_from_clinical_operations/,clinicalresearch,-0.9640770554542542

Is it normal for a CRC job to feel stressful? ,"I am incredibly stressed in my CRC job lately, working on 5+ studies in multiple therapeutic areas. 

My friend asked if my job is just secretary work. From recruitment, participant visits, specimen processing, being in the OR, data entry, sponsor communication, IMVs, and regulatory, there‚Äôs a lot going on at all times. The to-do list is never ending. 

Is it normal to feel stressed as a CRC, or do I need to shift my perspective? I know I‚Äôm not saving lives in the ED, but with so many competing deadlines, many of which are time sensitive, it‚Äôs overwhelming sometimes.

I'm not new (12+ years experience),, and I've worked with recruiters before that have been great. In the last month, though, I've had multiple recruiters reach out and set up a call with me and then just not show up to their own call. When I reached out to the first one to politely ask if everything was ok, they didn't even apologize, just tried to schedule me for another call. 

It happened again this morning and then recruiter messaged right after our scheduled time saying she had a client meeting and she'll call me this afternoon. Is this happening to anyone else?

Inexperience/impostor syndrome‚Ä¶,"I am feeling a lot of imposter syndrome (probably rightly so). I started working as a Clinical Trial Assistant at a large CRO FSP at a sponsor in 2020. I was promoted to a global study project manager just a little over a year later. I have been in the role since then (and been promoted another time within the role). My manager always says I‚Äôm doing great. However, I feel like I was promoted too quickly and with not enough experience tbh. I fully lead the project management of a large global clinical trial and I am haunted by what I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I feel like I skipped 3 steps (SC ‚Äî> CRA ‚Äî> CTM). 

Like, for example, I helped lead the development of a monitoring plan without ever being a CRA. And influence so many trial decisions (what is an important PD, what needs to be escalated, etc etc..)

One caveat is that there are a lot of checks and balances in this role - so I am usually never the sole decision maker/approver, but still. I can‚Äôt help but feel like I represent what is wrong with this industry right now (lack of experience in positions of authority).

I dream of being a study coordinator or a CRA to just have that experience under my belt so I feel like I can speak with authority and banish this imposter syndrome.

I know I should be grateful for this opportunity or ‚Äúcareer rocket ship‚Äù as some of my colleagues have noted but damn I am SO burnt out and battle serious imposter syndrome/anxiety. Some days I‚Äôm just pissed that they even hired me lol. I initially interviewed for the career experience and (to my surprise) I actually got the job. 

I feel so stuck now, but feel like I NEED to do a good job and finish my assigned project - or else my career is ruined.

Finally quit my old job!!!,"I worked as a CRC for 1 year at a young company. The first few months were great despite having a salary about as much as an entry level fastfood worker in CA. They refused to give me more despite my good performance (their words) and advanced degree saying they were a small company so they did not have financial capacity for it. They also do not have benefits. Since they were new, I ended up going above and beyond, doing things not in the job description, hoping to help them grow.

Fast forward to later, I got burnout due to increased workload and them saying this is my proving moment. They also hired a handful of new staff, some of who formed a clique and file complaints against anyone not in it. Sure you don't get along with everyone but my supervisors believed them (and even threatened to write me up for not listening to their demands when I have my own share of work) and use that to justify not giving me a raise. Not to mention that this company engages in a lot of fraud and falsifying information that they can get away with. As an example, I have been scolded for not backdating sign stickers. I also found out my coworker who started 5 months ago earns significantly more than me (we had the same amount of experience and the same number of degrees) so I knew they were stringing me along and not planning to raise my pay.

Anyway, thanks for listening to my vent. I found a job that has clearer growth trajectory and job description, higher pay and a shorter commute. In hindsight, I am grateful that this job equipped me with experience and allowed me to be pickier with my next job.

Don't trust one of my CRA's,"Let me start by saying I have some incredible monitors and trust almost everything they tell me when they monitor my work. BUT, I have this one monitor who has steered me wrong so many times, I am about to fire him. Let me know if I am over reacting. He requests monitoring visits a week prior.. like 2 full day visits. Claims he sent all of his follow up letters - none are in my email so I randomly got a bulk email of follow up letters. He claimed sponsor was pissed I didn't get assents on my 3 patients... they are 3, 18, and 22 (cognitively disabled). I explain their ages and why that's not appropriate. He goes on to say the 22 year old needed to sign assent and if she's not able to, the parent should have signed ASSENT. I said.... umm what? She signed the LAR part on the CONSENT. He told me I needed an SOP for why she didn't sign assent... So I go down this rabbit hole and find in my IRB why she shouldn't sign assent and write out very clearly in the email why I was so confused why a cognitively impaired person should sign assent. He emailed back ""sorry, I thought your subjects were between 7-17."" So my leader and I spent 3-4 hours looking up bullshit when he didn't take 2 minutes to look at their ages in the EDC. He also told me to lie on a NTF about why we had extra people (who were orienting to our department) and say they were supposed to be on the study but dropped out. I said I absolutely do not feel comfortable lying on a document that I AM SIGNING. There is so much more and I could go on. CRA's - is this normal behavior? He also never emails me and only calls, and I feel like it's because he doesn't want a paper trail.

"Manager says, despite my regular overtime, I need to be doing 'much more overtime' to prove my commitment and work towards a Senior CRA role. What hours do you work as a CRA?","TLDR; Manager thinks to reach senior CRA I need to be working big overtime, and shouldn't have a shorter day at all if I've worked big long travel days etc. What hours do you work as a CRA/ or other roles in clinical research? Is excessive overtime the new norm, or is this just a bad manager?  


For context I've been a CRA for 3.5 years, and a CRC for 6 years prior to that. Not a single CRA has received a promotion during my time at the company, largely due to repeated management change over, followed by no real time allocated to staff development.   
I tend to work my hours (40 hour work week) where I can. Over this year I have done around 90-100 hours of overtime, works out to a couple per week average, which I think is reasonable when you do a few extra hours on travel weeks etc.

However, in my managers words ""I've just done a 60 hour week and will still be working a full day tomorrow, if you want to be moving into that senior role you need to prove you're going above and beyond and do much more overtime. For instance employee x worked over the weekend to prepare that presentation a few weeks ago""  


This has never been the companies expectation prior to this management, they used to say if you work a big long travel day, just do a few hours the next day to even it out and do your contracted hours. So, this sucked to hear. I'm curious if this is a common expectation for us CRAs, or just a bad (and very new) manager expectation? What hours do you work in your role/s?

"I like clinical research, but HATE being a CRC. Advice for a looking for an alternative job?","Hi, so as the title states, I‚Äôve been a CRC for only 8 months and I hate it. What I dislike the most is having to deal with patients. I hate playing phone tag with them and having to act like a used cars salesman to enroll them in studies. It saps my energy and the PI I work with is rarely available, which causes poor work flow. 

I had taken the job because I was hopeful of transitioning into a career in pharma. Prior to this I finished a PhD in public health. So I already have a lot of research experience, but not clinical research.

I also had similar issues with the PhD, in that I disliked having to recruit and deal with participants. What I do like is writing the manuscripts for publication.

I recently resigned and my PI was so mad!,"Hi guys, 
I have a medical degree from outside the US, I have experience working as research assistant/coordinator for last 3 years. Last week I resigned my job as research assistant/coordinator and PI was extremely mad! I gave him 2 week notice, I even offered to help training the team and help the new hire, he would still treat me badly. 

During my time with him, I was doing literally everything, recruiting patients, writing protocols and ICFs, writing abstracts, papers, writing an IND, communicating with FDA and IRB, dealing with all regulatory paperwork and processes, ect. 

I was extremely underpaid for the amount of work I was doing [37k] while people around me was getting paid the same and doing much less or even getting more paid [45k] with only focus on recruiting patients!! By their admission, I was their best employee.

So I started searching and applying for jobs around and I had multiple applications under department review, eventually had an interview within a week of applying and offer for regulatory coordinator [remote working + much better payment] so I submitted my resignation.

My PI and his co-pi literally were mad, they said what I did was unprofessional and I should have told them that I need a raise before applying to other jobs. I stayed with them for year and 8 month, learnt most of the stuff by myself, and when I tried before to raise the issue of being underpaid and overworked, my PI simply told me to go work for someone else!! Thats what I did!

As I said, I tried to calm things down but they basically dealt with me as if I'm the one who is wrong, who is out there trying to break down the team. They even somehow threatened me that they know people from hospitals around and that my reputation will follow me!
Later, this week they send the department administrator with a counter offer, but I said NO, because I was worried about how they treated me when I decided to leave!

3 people before me left and nothing like this happened, they didn't even hand over any keys, badges, projects, ect. Now they asked me to stay for a whole month instead of 2 weeks, they want detailed manual of what I was doing step by step, they wanted me to start a new project before leaving. Before leaving hand over everything including my photo badge!

"What's your best ""I didn't follow the IRB approval notice to the letter"" story?","Long story short, I make patient facing materials (think study specific advertisements and study descriptions) and have been put in a group with a couple of jackwagons who think it's totally fine to ""tweak"" any sort of patient facing materials AFTER receiving IRB approval.

Embracing deep work and slow productivity?,"I've always been a fan of Cal Newport's work Deep Work and now I've been reading up on Slow Productivity, and I wonder if there's a way for us in this industry to properly embrace the principles of these two books (oversimplification, but a quality over quantity philosophy)? My experience as a PM is so badly affected as this industry prioritizes speedy responses and expediting timelines and meeting deliverables that it's quite hard to really slow down and ask *what the fuck are we rushing for?* (i mean aside from pushing them to the market ASAP)

I think the frantic, rushed culture demanded by most Big Pharma sponsors cause many oversight and mistakes made on multiple levels, from sites to vendors to CROs to even sponsors themselves. It's so exhausting. I am managing a 30-protocol workload and more often than not, I feel like I'm putting out fires than you know, Managing a Project. I feel like rushing often causes more mistakes which causes more delays, it's ridiculous. Not sure if it's the lack of experience on my part but surely PMs of other industry do not feel this small and insignificant in managing their projects?

CCRC Calling it Quits. What the heck do I do next?,"I'm feeling hopeless about my future as a CCRC. I'm good at my job, but the industry is not treating us well lately. **I'm looking for advice on what roles I might be able to transition into.** I've looked into CRA, project management, reg coordinator, and recruitment with few responses in my area or remotely (Austin, TX). The job market here is stale, with lower salaries and fewer opportunities than ever, dwindling since the pandemic lockdown in March 2020. The job leads I find amount to disappointment, as many companies are just interviewing to see what's out there, it seems, as the same lame postings are still up month after month, apparently unfilled. Any tips/advice would be much appreciated!

I have a bachelor's degree, CCRC cert, technical writing cert, all the usual accompanying CRC certs (BLS, CCRS, GCP, IATA, etc), over 7 years experience as CRC, with clinical laboratory/phlebotomy SME bragging rights (so to speak). I also have 6 years experience of inpatient critical care (support staff).

Bear with me peeps - this post has details for clarity, so yes, it's lengthy.

I've been a coordinator for several years at FutureSearch (6 years), Elligo (1 month), Pinnacle (4 months), GI Alliance/TDDC (present), Care Access (7 months), and DermResearch (6 months). The only one worth a damn was the first one (FutureSearch), and at the time, I was about to pull my hair out even there. The trend I'm seeing at every single site is a lack of cohesive planning and effective management. **CRCs are often expected to manage themselves and their sites without the title or clout to leverage any effective improvement.** It's a tough spot to be in, to put it mildly. I've also seen an appalling lack of experienced or dedicated staff in the field, no doubt stemming from the previously mentioned lack of management/support. Who wants to stay in a field that is notoriously underpaid, understaffed, and unappreciated? **Add to that the general distaste, disrespect, and and disregard often heaped upon CRCs by a therapeutic practice's practitioners** (whom you are forced to appease and continue to work with... despite their bad attitudes to enroll their patients as test subjects and make money for their practice while advancing the future development of the very therapies they rely on...)

It's a miracle anyone stays on this long. I'm beginning to question the whole thing as I'm weary of witnessing the decline of the research industry at the site level.

I‚Äôm currently an oncology research nurse and I want to know if there is growth in this field as a research nurse. I do not want to be a clinical manager or a traveling CRA and I do not want to stay a research nurse coordinator forever. Nurses that left the research nurse coordinator role? Where did you go? Did you end up getting more pay and more work flexibility like work from home or hybrid? How long did it take you to transition out?

I currently have the option to leave the field and go train to be en epic analyst RN which seems to have an upward mobility and opportunities for work from home.

I want some input. I‚Äôm unsure if I should leave research nursing and pursue this other field.

Passed my CCRC,"My current employer is the first one that has offered to pay for me to get certified, but did not pay for any additional study materials. 

I was incredibly nervous even though I‚Äôve been working in CR for years now, I‚Äôve seen posts on here of people who studied every day for months and still failed even with the supplemental ACRP study guides. 

I‚Äôm here to say I crammed the last two weeks at most and used only free resources I could find online and when taking the test I felt really good about it.

What I would recommend focusing on:
-ICH Guidelines !!! (E2A, E6[R2], E8, E9, E11)
-Sponsor Vs. investigator responsibilities 
- Reporting criteria and timelines 
-IP Drug Accountability and Compliance % 
- Situational scenarios and what chain of command you would alert first as a CRC (PI vs. IRB vs. Sponsor, etc.)
-Essential Docs

How I studied:
-Quizlet !!!!!
-Detailed Content Outline from ACRP
-ICH Guidelines from their website

I do think if you have been a coordinator for some time and have experience with study start-up, IP accountability, and handling AE/SAE you will be pretty prepared going into the situational questions. 

When I was preparing for my exam reading threads of other people talking about what they studied and how helped me a lot, so I hope this helps someone too!!

How do I go about quitting my role as a clinical research coordinator after 4 months?

I had taken over the studies for a PI who had been without a research coordinator for 1.5 years; all of his previous coordinators had quit on him in less than one year. The workload is not bad, however, there is a lot of pressure to recruit patients into these formerly inactive studies. In addition, I have to do a lot of clean up and organization for these studies in terms of the paperwork, finances, data entry queries (that are more than 2-3 years old). Over time, I‚Äôve gotten better at these skills but communicating with these clinical doctors and principal investigators have demoralized me. I get lash back from clinical staff when I try to go onto the floors to recruit patients for these studies. I‚Äôve been yelled at multiple times by clinical doctors for asking permission to approach their patients for these studies. At the same time, I‚Äôm getting pressure from some of the PI‚Äôs to improve my recruitment numbers. Some of them are even suggesting me to employ unethical or not allowed methods of recruitment (e.g., data mining, cold calling, creating repository of patient medical numbers).

My opinions on getting into the clinical research industry as a CRA,"I see a lot of threads about people wanting to work at a CRO or pharma, usually as a CRA out of college, or as a pivot from allied health, study coordinator role, or a job in academia.  After 15 years working at a couple of CROs, including time spent as a hiring manager, I have some insight I figured I'd share.

It's become very difficult to get a job as a CRA with no monitoring experience, that's for sure, no matter what degree or other experience you have.  Unfortunately pharmas see any CRA with little or no monitoring experience as a risk, and pharmas hate risk.  From a CRO perspective it's getting harder each year to resource a project with CRAs with no monitoring experience  ,sometime sponsors want monitoring experience in the specific therapeutic area.  Sometimes they want at least two years' monitoring trials for their specific indication. 

The solution that seems to work is various ""bridge"" programs the large CROs have, where they train office-based clinical research support roles in monitoring.  Individuals in these roles often do remote data review, accompany CRAs into the field to assist with file review, etc.  After a year or two the individual might ""graduate"" as a CRA1 already some monitoring experience.

So the best advice I have is, if you want to be a CRA you should look for office-based clinical research support roles for the largest CROs.  Even if the positions aren't advertised as CRA bridge/trainee positions, it's still worth a shot, CROs sometimes help internal candidates from study start up, clinical research assistants, etc. into internal bridge programs.  This may require a relocation to northeast US, or North Carolina.  It may also require a pay cut if you're coming from allied health or another established career path.  However I'd focus on this more than any masters' degree, private CRA training, certification etc.  Of the factors you can control, I think this will make much more of a difference that any of those other things.  It's becoming more difficult each year to recruit a study coordinator, pharma sales rep, nurse, physician or lab person directly into a CRA role, no matter what their degree is, and no matter what their qualifications and experience may be outside of monitoring.

Is Clinical Research Recession proof?,"With current market environments and record high inflation, what do you think of the possibility of layoffs and outlook? Like CTM, CRA, CRC, Clinical scientists, etc. 

Lots of hiring freezes, lay offs, higher competition is occurring in other sectors such as tech and finance.

Tbh, I actually think clinical research is pretty recesssion proof because we need drugs, people always will care about health, research is always valuable, and alot of sponsors that pay the CRO or the money the sponsor gets are from investors and big big grants from NIH, other government entities, or rich philanthropist. 

I know those in academics should be pretty secured but not sure if the same will apply to industry and to the big names like ICON, IQVIA, PPD, etc",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/ve38ap/is_clinical_research_recession_proof/,clinicalresearch,-0.9106228947639465

Can an ISF truly be reconciled?,"Basically the title. As a CRA, I have found it incredibly difficult to ensure that a site is maintaining their ISF appropriately. While core documents like the delegation of authority log, protocol signature pages, etc. may be filed correctly and updated. I have noticed that sites will struggle to maintain sponsor provided documents, IRB approved materials, vendor manuals, and other GCP or Sponsor required documents (per the TMF index). I‚Äôll often schedule one day during a monitoring visit exclusively to dedicate to reviewing reg, but it never feels like enough. At the next visit, I‚Äôll find that a site has not filed any of the recent files that they should have filed or the new protocol amendment has not been documented for training. Occasionally I‚Äôll often receive pushback by study coordinators or regulatory staff on whether a certain document is ‚Äúactually‚Äù required to be filed. I will always reference GCP/other regulations or the Sponsor TMF index and say that it is but will get a response along the lines of ‚Äúbut that‚Äôs so much paper‚Äù. I will then reference FDA regulations (as I‚Äôm a US CRA) and say that documents can be filed electronically as long as it meets the the regulatory requirements, but that it is ultimately the site and investigator‚Äôs responsibility to file them appropriately. This will result in my follow-up letters being filled with missing document follow-up items, which usually are not actioned on until my next monitoring visit.

I realize that sites are incredibly busy, but I sometimes feel like I cannot feasibly ensure that the site has all their required documents filed at each visit, yet sites are relying on CRAs to assist with this. Most sites also seem unaware of how to maintain their ISFs due to misunderstanding the regulatory requirements. This is not a knock on sites at all. Perhaps this just speaks to how difficult it is to run studies and meet the sheer volume of regulations (which can be very vague).

How do you manage being a CRA? I'm close to drop everything,"Hello

First of all, seeing most of the posts with salaries in dollars I want to clarify that I work in Europe. 

I am making this thread because I am looking for good advice regarding my situation and career. 

I started working as a CRA almost 4 years ago in a small company with less than 50 employees. The atmosphere was very good and 1 year ago I joined one of the top 4 CROs in the world. 
And since then I feel that I am totally cracking up. 

I find the pace of travel unbearable. OK, I only have 8 DOS, but there is no stability between weeks, it's impossible to find time for myself and to plan activities outside of work. 
Each visit leads to a report, but since the CRA is asked to take care of almost everything with its centres, it is implicitly asked of the cra to work nights in the hotel and some weekends to be up to date on the follow-up, the reports and the 50/60 daily e-mails. 
I refuse to have 60 hour weeks.

I find the CRA findings more and more ridiculous. Searching for the smallest isssue when the site makes a mistake in filling in the CRF because they have 800 studies to manage at the same time. Why did x take 20,457 days to answer the queries. Why for the document at this mark but not the other, etc..

And then we CRAs are harassed to validate the metrics in time. Reports, trainings, timesheets, DOS, findings, action items, queries... 


The worst thing is that when I talk to the other CRAs I meet in the office or on the road, there is no problem.
Everyone is happy with the travels, the pace.... 
Each CRA works in its own corner. There is no team spirit, it's all about individualism and validate those metrics. 
How do you do it all? How does it not bother you, how come nobody complains? 
Am I missing something?

It's obvious to me that I'm not cut out to work in a big company.
But is this job possible for someone who is quiet and poised by nature with a leisurely pace but qualitative in detail and support to centres. 

If not, do you know of any alternatives, other possible jobs with arc experience?

Tired of being belittled.,"What the title says. I am a CRA 2 and have been working as a CRA 4 years. I have 4 Phase 1 oncology protocols (2 of them are sister studies) and in general I feel like I‚Äôm providing good work. 


For one study the CL is unbearable. I was added to the protocol in Mar/Apr. If I miss an email by a day (even if that day I was in the middle of the visit for another study, traveling, or even presenting an SIV, which obviously I cannot step away from), she comments ‚Äúyou are the site manager and you should be handling this‚Äù or ‚Äúreminder, this is your job‚Äù. I don‚Äôt get these kinds of comments from my other CLs. This is happening to the point that seeing a ping in the outlook folder for that study makes my BP go up. Her excuse is always ‚ÄúI‚Äôm new to this CL position and I have to manage all (5-6) CRAs but if you are a CRA 2 you should have picked it up by now.‚Äù


My LM is aware of the conflict because the CL probably made a complaint to her, so she gets cc‚Äôd on every email. During my last 1:1 with my LM she confirmed she sees all the requests and deadlines are funneled into 1 day of 10x emails being sent at the same time. Yet if I try to reach out to the CL for a question she ghosts for a while and then comes back with ‚ÄúOF COURSE/NOT, I‚Äôd expect you to know this‚Äù.


And maybe related or unrelated, a bunch of my colleagues were recently promoted. My good friend colleague even got bumped up to senior CRA, yet she‚Äôs been out on medical leave for the past 3-4 months and we started working at this CRO at the same time. I have no issues with that and am so happy for her, but I‚Äôm upset about the situation itself because I have a feeling that the CL‚Äôs complaints are what held me back. 


I don‚Äôt know if this is more of a rant or looking for advice? This is bringing the most stress I‚Äôve ever experienced in my 12 years working in clinical research. Her demands to be met at the top of my priority list is definitely affecting how I manage all of my other protocols. I fight to make my KPIs stay green but it‚Äôs becoming a hassle because of this issue. I begged my LM to please switch me to another protocol and even proposed some that are looking for CRAs but she wants me to wait it out and see if she can suggest another CRA to be added to the study. 


I‚Äôm pretty much crying every other day. Sorry this post ended up being a lot longer than expected but thanks for the read.

**Edit to add: Thanks for your comments, it reminds me that there are decent, realistic humans in this industry after all. Fun short story - Just today, CL sent another demand and actually requested that my LM provide support. She is literally asking my LM to do work for this study. Lol what is she expecting, pretty sure she can‚Äôt do that? I have no idea where this CL‚Äôs mind is, but it‚Äôs clearly not in the right place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1ff49pd/tired_of_being_belittled/,clinicalresearch,-0.9947315454483032
CRA burnout ,"Hello everyone, Hope all is well. 

I‚Äôm honestly extremely devastated. In the past year, I have noted that the management started over assigning me projects. When I started feeling that this is too much, I escalated my concern to my line manager. At that time , I had an annual leave planned and he mentioned that we can reassess this upon my return. The moment I returned , so many internal reviews and audits started occurring and I was requesting the team to reschedule some of them especially as I was just back with an extreme backlog. However, the team proceeded and in the meantime, my workload started getting worse and worse with no time to even discuss anything because everything was back to back. Later on, my colleague went on a long leave and I was given her study which is extremely difficult and honestly one fully dedicated CRA would need to work on it considering their extremely demanding requests. At that time, I still am assigned a total of 6 projects and other regulatory tasks. The team decided to start doing handovers however the timing is not right considering that I have urgent tasks including finalizing the start ups, initiation and activation of the sites for this extremely demanding study.

CRAs pushing back on inheriting bad sites ,"Hello! 
Do any of my fellow CRAs or LMs have experience with CRAs pushing back on inheriting ‚Äúproblem‚Äù sites? 

I‚Äôm fully aware that problem sites are part of site management/ being a CRA. I‚Äôve had plenty of ‚Äúproblem sites‚Äù; however, I was fully supported by my study team. 

For this particular project, I‚Äôve witnessed firsthand the turnover of CRAs and study managers. I‚Äôd be roughly the fifth CRA assigned to this site, which I‚Äôm sure is equally frustrating on all sides.

The reason for putting me on this site has not been disclosed to me, as the other CRA is not leaving the company or has any idea I might replace them. The study managers are useless. The sponsor then points fingers at an already poor performing site, which is then compounded by ineffective management and undefined expectations that are impossible for the CRA to meet.

The turnover continues. Some leaving on their own accord. Some being removed entirely and then being replaced. Replacement personnel come in just as clueless. No actual mitigation measures implemented or sponsor interventions. Rinse. Repeat. 

My main concern with inheriting this site is the poor STUDY management causing downstream effects on the CRAs. CRAs can only perform as well as they are managed. And if the management is spotty, well ‚Ä¶ 
I also have an already established ~not so great rapport~ with this site due to some previous co-monitoring experiences/ interim coverage I‚Äôve provided when other CRAs were turning over. 

My LM has not been supportive of the concerns I raised and is basically telling me to suck it up. I tried to emphasize that it‚Äôs not that I ‚Äúcan‚Äôt handle‚Äù a bad site, it‚Äôs that I can‚Äôt handle a bad site when I‚Äôm not supported and don‚Äôt want to be caught up in a he said/ she said escalation mess (which I‚Äôve witnessed firsthand several times on this project and site). Basically, it‚Äôs a huge mess I didn‚Äôt create nor want any part of. I‚Äôve also had LM turnover - so I‚Äôm having quite a bit of disconnect with this new one, who doesn‚Äôt understand the historical storyboard of not only this site, but the entire project. 

On a salty note, I‚Äôd also be the CRA with lowest seniority level that has ever been assigned to this site - and I was just denied for a promotion (despite all my accolades/ stellar metrics). The vibe I‚Äôm getting is-  the study team is unhappy with the current CRA‚Äôs oversight, so they want to put me on because I‚Äôm the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù CRA on the project. 

Do CRAs have a right to push back for situations like this? Or is this just expected to go about business per usual‚Ä¶ ",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1dt5pgf/cras_pushing_back_on_inheriting_bad_sites/,clinicalresearch,-0.9994239807128906
Unrealistic Expectations of CRA Life,"I‚Äôm fairly new to the CRA world and I am already feeling the CRA burn-out. I currently feel that the expectations are unrealistic and unfair and provide no room for a work life balance. Most of the information relayed during training has been non applicable to what I‚Äôm going through now. I‚Äôm also concerned about having a line manager that doesn‚Äôt have any experience being a CRC or CRA and are monitoring CRAs. With that being said I‚Äôm already looking for my next career pathway. I‚Äôm looking for something with a better work life balance for when I want to settle down and start a family, so no travel for me.

I‚Äôm open to anything at this point. It doesn‚Äôt even have to be in research. Is there anything fully remote within the same salary range as a CRA? 

I have healthcare, CRC, and still building my CRA experience. I was thinking at most 1 a 1.5 years and then leave because the experience hasn‚Äôt been that great. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1ct4pp4/unrealistic_expectations_of_cra_life/,clinicalresearch,-0.9993372559547424
What are we doing wrong?,"My partner has been working in clinical research for 5 years - predominantly as a CTA in the NHS. She worked as a clinical monitor (CRA) for a few months before leaving quite abruptly for a number of reasons. 

She‚Äôs spent some time away (3 months) and certain this is the career for her. She‚Äôs been applying to hundreds of CRA (as she‚Äôs done the training) and even CTA roles but met with rejection after rejection. She has had a few CRA interviews and then just never hears back (is this normal? Literally 4 interviews at Parexel, IQVIA, PPD and ICON then just ghosted!). 

All of the jobs applied for she has the experience for, including a strong background in clinical research. I‚Äôm not really sure if we‚Äôre missing a trick here or if it‚Äôs usually this hard?

Should we start a union for clinical research professionals?,"All -- Using a throwaway account. I'm a new project manager for a mid-sized CRO in the United States. I've been in clinical research for ten years and I have previously worked as a CRA and started as a study coordinator, so I've seem all facets of the clinical research world.

I have a serious question and just want to gauge interest: How many people would be interested in working together to start a clinical research labor union? I envision it representing and being open to all clinical research professionals.

**Rationale**: We all know clinical research jobs have diminished from an all-time high two years ago to what are now slim pickings. Moreover, I'm disturbed at the effort to essentially outsource CRAs and other CRPs to RBQM and RBM study models and I don't think doing so is in the interest of patients, sites, or companies, even if the ICH claims to have evidence that risk-based monitoring models are 'just as good'. Combined that with years of being stretched thin and, quite frankly, being abused by unrealistic workloads and I just feel like we need representation and more collective power.

I'm going to add a poll below. ***The poll question is: 'Would you be interested in joining, or working to establish, a labor union for clinical research professionals?'***

Also, in addition to voting in the poll, please consider giving my post an upvote so that it can reach as many people as possible.

Time to move on??,"I‚Äôve been at PPD (FSP) for 2 years as a CRA I, first 7 months I had no studies, then the studies I did get had no movement, no patients, nothing to monitor. A year in I got those studies taken away and given 2 brand new studies that were in SSU, they threw 5 SQVs at once, it was a mess! Recovered from that and been on a good path since. Work life balance & travel have been great, but I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôm doing more than my job title, yet bc I don‚Äôt have the ‚Äúmetrics‚Äù I can‚Äôt get the CRA II promotion. 
I know the only way to move up is to jump around, but I‚Äôm afraid my lack of monitoring experience will hinder me.
Before becoming a CRA I was an oncology CRC/project manager for 8 years in academia setting, my studies now are not oncology (which is what eventually I want to go back to), but I have done over 10 SQVs, a handful of blinded and unblinded SIVs and 2 unblinded on-site MVs.

Am I unreasonable to ask for a raise?,"I recently found out that a new colleague (new hire, less than 3 months, no experience) is making $10k more per year than I am currently making. I‚Äôve been with the company for over 3 years, and I am the only coordinator at one of our hospitals, he is part of a team of 4 at another hospital. When I brought this up to a colleague turned manager, she basically said he never should have mentioned his salary, and he has a higher degree than me. Then she offered to help me ask for a raise in the spring when we have reviews. Should I trust the offer is genuine? I feel like a complete asshole. I love my job, my patients, physicians and clinical trials that i am working on. But I can‚Äôt seem to shake the feeling that I‚Äôm really being unfairly paid.

Will this be a losing battle for me? Is it worth it to come prepared with evidence as to why I feel like I deserve a raise? I feel like my manager is going to straight turn me down without even hearing what I have to say. Again, I definitely feel like a jerk for want to make as much as the new hire.

I got auto-rejected (twice) from a position that I ended up getting an offer for,"Just to give you an idea of how rough it is for applicants out here‚Ä¶

I have been working for 2 years in an FSP at one of the big CROs. A lot of my coworkers started in my position then were promoted after a year or two so I had been staying at this job in hopes of the same. 

Finally a couple positions opened up in the FSP last month and my line manager let me know.  They were unsure of when the job would be posted but luckily I was able to submit to both open positions on the internal career portal within a few hours of them being posted so I‚Äôm pretty confident I was in the pool of early applicants. 

I submitted the applications Friday afternoon and by Monday morning I had already been rejected. Both rejections came within a minute of each other.  Highly doubtful a human even looked at my resume.


I was super salty tbh because my line manager had been encouraging me to apply and this position was on my 2024 employee goals so I had been doing extra trainings and taking on extra responsibilities to prepare myself. 


I had been gearing up my nerves to ask my line manager why I had been rejected without even a second thought but also I am pretty confident they wouldn‚Äôt have an answer. 

Luckily I got a call from the recruiter that following Friday and had the offer within a week thereafter but man this was such a rollercoaster and I‚Äôm just annoyed at how disjointed and shitty the corporate application process is in general. 

Also I was pretty shocked at how low the raise was. Only 9% increase from my current position but a massive increase in workload and responsibilities. 

Throughout the interview process it was emphasized that the CRO wouldn‚Äôt even interview external candidates until the internal ones were interviewed. And they emphasized they would prefer to promote from within the FSP. 

I feel very lucky I was able to break into industry as a CTA during the COVID boom because I don‚Äôt think I would have been able to in the current job market, even with my 4 years of CRC experience and an MPH. 

So all in all this job market is a crapshoot and really just seems to be based on luck and timing. 

Good luck to everyone applying now and don‚Äôt let the corporate overlords get you down!

* (Senior) CRAs pay well but everyone knows it's not a long-term solution (workload/stress)?
* Biostatisticians/clinical scientists/medical writers- would require going back for a Masters/PhD (and cap out at $150k-ish?)
* Software engineer- would require extensive coding training, then further coding experience to meet qualifications?
* Other?

Posting anon bc I‚Äôm processing a lot of shame and other heavy emotions.

I‚Äôm not special, but I kind of feel like I‚Äôve been especially unlucky in this career. I kind of wonder if it‚Äôs the US state I‚Äôm in and the culture of academic medicine here.  I‚Äôve been involved elsewhere and it didn‚Äôt seem quite so‚Ä¶cold? Arrogant? Plain mean?  

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve been a model employee 100% of the time, but I‚Äôm definitely not stupid or incompetent or a fuck up, I‚Äôve made meaningful contributions on every study, and peers are almost always highly complimentary of my work. But my bosses? Different story. 

To date, I have 7 years of clinical trials experience. A few more years of straight healthcare. Also a couple more of other research experience, bench, lit.  A year at a CRO, less than 4 at a famous cancer center, now a year in Cards. Device, Pharma, immunotherapy, gene therapy, you name it. 

I feel‚Ä¶ sick to my stomach right now.  There is something really toxic about the academic clinical research experiences I‚Äôve had.  The site managers are some of the meanest people I‚Äôve met.  Bullies, all of the last 4 (but not all mangers, the previous 3 to the 4 were not). I‚Äôve been told by a manager to ‚Äúbe grateful for what I have‚Äù while making 50k, with 5 years CR professional experience and an MS, successfully running and implementing phase 1/2 IVD immunotherapy trials, in a city where the average 1bedroom rent is 2.3k. I had another manager literally lie to my face, and then lie again on record, to cover her ass/incompetence and frame me. I had a coworker delete my project documents (contact lists with essential personnel contact info) and try to gaslight me about it. When presented with the IT evidence, she played dumb and management did nothing but shrug and say they ‚Äúhad to believe what they were told.‚Äù  Another manager progressively took more and more responsibilities away from me (that I was successful at) bc I struggled with timely data entry (raging adhd and boredom with the task, but also it was lab data for observational study of multiple cancer therapies and it was two years old and incredibly disorganized - it could take 20minutes to figure out a single lab value to enter - literally finding a needle in a haystack). Her reasoning? She said she ‚Äúcould tell I thought I was too good for it‚Äù and the implication was she would teach me a lesson in humility. Instead it crushed my confidence and my mental health (came on the tail of rejection from medical school applications - and the real reason I‚Äôve been doing CR at the site.) 

Today I had lengthy conversation with my superiors about needing my role to be more defined; what I got was repeated vague metaphors and contemptuous comments about how they‚Äôd already communicated this to me. My specific examples of where leadership and boundaries were needed were ignored and answered with more vague generalizations that I‚Äôve already heard.  It doesn‚Äôt help that my direct supervisor is the most hyper-critical person I‚Äôve met since I was raised by a covert narcissist.

I like really big complicated problems with lots of moving parts. I hate paperwork. I love creating organizational systems. I don‚Äôt always remember rules or info that don‚Äôt make logical sense or otherwise have enormous impact on trial outcomes. My CRO experience largely made sense. The site does not. Like spaghetti on the wall instead of the plate. Chaos and messy and leaving you unsatisfied.

I like the people I work with. The job has its own unique ebbs and flows completely unlike anything I've ever experienced before. I'm a CRA but my primary role is data entry. And honestly, I don't know if I'm cutout for this kind of work and data entry isn't the issue... I think it's just I'm not a good match for this industry.

I know I will never be a coordinator. The amount of things they have to do is fucking insane and I respect the shit out of every single one of them at my workplace. But man, on top of visits, the amount of other things they have to do is mindboggling.

Well... we need to go through hundreds of subjects now to change it.

CRA - is this normal? -_-,"I work for a major CRO, it rhymes with truvia. I started working in an FSP model and I was quickly added to 5 protocols and some of them have 6 site assignments. Thankfully they‚Äôre mostly regional but I have so many sites to the point that I don‚Äôt even remember the lead coordinators name at some of them let alone all the ins and outs of all separate protocols.

I‚Äôve recently been really struggling with getting used to the new systems, vendors, site level processes and SOPs. Is there really anything I can do to at least appear in top of it with all the sites I‚Äôm working with and line management? I am confident in my level of skill as a monitor but this degree of work with all the sites and separate protocols has left me feeling so jaded with the job I can hardly bear to read through the daily 200 emails. 

How did we get here? I think these new risk based models surrounding monitoring are making it so that sponsors and CROs are quick to think that less frequent days on site per month justifies more site assignments in general. At first I was an avid supporter for risk based monitoring and lowering the frequency of IMVs but now I wonder about overall quality and depth whenever I‚Äôm on site. 

Do I hop to another CRO? Or maybe look for another functional department?

Got fired after 1 month of training ,"I started at a small sponsor company at the end of August leaving the CRO life behind. I did this because the opportunity sounded good because as we all know less travel for a CRA is amazing and that‚Äôs what I was promised by this company. 

 I finished my training and got sites assigned to me at the beginning of Oct. I have only been traveling for in person training in North Carolina and 2 onsite co monitoring visits. 

Fast forward, got a weird email for a meeting. Got into the meeting and the VP and HR were on the call. In the call they said they were letting me go. Reason they gave me in the call was that I was not compliant with the company policy. I asked if they could be specific and they said they could not tell me. I called my recruiter because in the morning they called me to just see how the job was because the recruiter works closer with the company as a third party recruiter. The recruiter said he will talk to HR and the VP to see what‚Äôs going on.

The day after I emailed HR to answer some questions and to ask the specific reason for the termination. They said it was because I had violations in the travel and expense policy. My recruiter called me and he said he was told that the company and I were not a good fit. 

So overall, I only was with the company for 1 month and gone to travel for 3 trips and now they let me go without warning because of the travel policy‚Ä¶

Coping with the stress of working in clinical research ,"I am a site CRC working on over five studies across multiple therapeutic areas. My colleagues are lovely and the patients are a joy to work with. 

But the stress and pressure can be so intense. Any urgencies, last minute-ness, and other issues almost always fall onto the CRC. The PI‚Äôs can be very condescending and ungrateful - rarely a thanks, usually just a ‚Äúdo more, enroll more, and do it faster‚Äù. The CRCs bear most of the brunt of the PI and sponsor demands to always do more and do it ASAP.

I enjoy my work and the people I work with. I care very much about my patients having access to the best treatments. I understand accuracy and efficiency are necessary. At the same time, I don‚Äôt work in the ER, and ‚Äúurgent‚Äù is not life threatening. But the way things are conveyed with such urgency can be very stressful. The demands pile on, PI‚Äôs keep adding studies even tho we are already overworked, and everyone wants something now. 

Whenever someone is unhappy (patient, PI, sponsor, or anyone else), it usually is directed at the CRC. At my site, the blame always goes to the CRC first, even if the issue was caused by someone else. We are often the least respected among all clinical trial staff, yet we essentially run the studies. It is mentally exhausting to carry the burden and to feel like my work is never enough, no matter how much I do.

How do others manage the stress of it all?

"Why do monitoring visits sometimes seem like a carousel? (Site, CRO, Sponsor perspectives all welcome)","Hello,

  
I have worked for several large organizations over my years at the site level as a CRC. I have always been amazed by the sheer volume of CRAs that rotate through my monitoring logs for visits, even over the span of 1 year.

The low hanging fruit is obvious and definitely a factor - people leave the industry from burnout, change companies for more pay, get promoted and/or transferred to a new project.

My question is really about the nuances behind what drives this dynamic. 

Anecdotally, I will share that I have had CRAs that come on site to monitor a project and ask for similar things that have been previously requested and checked off from previous monitoring reports/ follow-up reports. I am always happy to provide the source requested, but when it is provided multiple times I am always curious to ask the CRA who is monitoring what the deal is, sometimes I hear things like, ""...CRA X wasnt doing their job...in so many words..."" If the same document is being requested and checked multiple times by different CRAs, is the task not being completed by previous CRAs? I'm also not referring to a document that would be continually updated/changing - like DoA, IP log, Temp logs.

While I have never had a CRA show up and disappear during monitoring visits, I have heard from other site staff at in person IMs that will say they have had CRAs who will arrive, sign the monitoring visit log and then go AWOL for the rest of the visit. 

How are these people getting hired and maintaining employment in such a heavily regulated field if they aren't doing the work? It would seem to me that people without work ethic would make life miserable for anyone that comes after them to monitor and ""clean up.""

Productivity is over 120% but ofcourse we know this is less than what we actually do. DBLs every month with very little notice (one month at most) and just found out i have an audit coming up. I know this is a bit of a rant but I don't think the CRA life is for me",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1evzece/exhausted_cra/,clinicalresearch,-0.9995168447494507
Co-worker does nothing but complain ,"After being laid off for seven months, I was finally able to get a great job as a remote Clinical Data Specialist! Of course, the relief is short lived because now I'm stuck with a co-worker who started the same time as me and complains about every little thing!

She complains about overtime rules, she complains about the salary. She complains about the site and the sponsors. She complains about the queries we receive. 

One would think that working remotely would allow me to ignore her, but not when there's Microsoft Teams! Now she calls me on teams at least twice a day, sometimes to ask questions but mostly to complain. In the past three days, I've had to listen to about three hours of complaining.

She's also incredibly incompetent. The sponsor asked her to fix about 30 CRFs that she filled out incorrectly to which her initial attitude was ""F that - I'm not doing that"". Eventually she realized she had to and I offered to help, but wound up doing just about all of them as she complained to me over teams for a half hour.

We had to help her out with entry today, but of course it was completely all over the place. She also reminded those helping her that she could only work to a certain time because she had a hair appointment pretty much trying to suggest that, if there was still work, it was on us to finish it for her.

Now I have a huge study starting on Monday and it seems that she's already decided that I need her help even though I didn't ask for it. All of a sudden, she thinks she's my boss, checking with me to make sure I'm receiving and reading all email communication.

I don't want her help. For starters, having to answer questions every ten minutes is not help, not to mention it won't be a two second chat. It will be a thirty minute call in which 29 minutes and 30 seconds will be her bitching. She can't handle her own workload and she seems to mess up a lot.

Any advice on how to deal with someone like her? I can't ignore the teams calls. She'll do it repeatedly until I answer and chat me that she needs to call until I finally cave. I've only been at this job for three months and do not want to already start going to MGMT about a co-worker. It's so bad though that I literally will be spending my weekend coming up with a professional way to tell her not to touch my study on Monday. 

Any ideas would be great!",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1eokicr/coworker_does_nothing_but_complain/,clinicalresearch,-0.9994344115257263
"People who switched from site to sponsor, what's something you wish you had known or done before you started?","Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been a CRC/Sr. CRC at a large cancer hospital for over 5 years and feel quite comfortable with my current role. Earlier this year, I decided to transition to the industry side for new challenges. Fortunately, I recently accepted an offer from a mid-sized sponsor as part of their global study team. I‚Äôm really excited because it‚Äôs been 6 months since I started job hunting, and this position with this company is one of my dream roles.

I‚Äôm both thrilled and nervous, wondering if I‚Äôve made the right decision to switch to a sponsor role and if I‚Äôll adapt to the corporate, fast-paced environment. 

For those who have transitioned from academic sites to the sponsor side, was there anything you wish you had known or done before starting your first sponsor role?

Management phoniness in the work place,"I would like to give a shout out to

\* The line managers who enter on their teem meeting minutes for us CRAs to make sure to not work on the weekends, because it's not good work life balance. So they can look good when they turn in their meeting minutes to their higher-ups.

\* The project leaders who send cute emails for us to not take life too seriously and get out and take a break from work to enjoy the weather, and of course copied to their managers to make them look good.

While at the same time these SAME PEOPLE over-allocate us on purpose and like to  run lean to save money by having us do monitor visits full time by day and in-house CTA work full time at night second shift (forced and unpaid). And send emergency emails all day like rapid gunfire in my face and copied to all my managers to stress us out and make us look bad for never doing enough work even after working all day and all night and on the weekends. And when I ask about working second night shifts as a permanent set up, the cold callous answer is ""that's just part of being a CRA.""

Syneos not bringing in fall 24‚Äô interns,"Heard Syneos isn‚Äôt bringing in any fall interns. Not because the program isn‚Äôt working out, because they don‚Äôt want to pay for it. Also heard, and seen there have been layoffs. Seeing some fishy stuff people are talking about like at ICON, and also now Syneos is weird.

So much good work to be done in this space, it‚Äôs a shame to see how far away the industry is from being great, simply because companies want to spend the least amount of money possible. Guess that makes sense from a business standpoint. I can‚Äôt help but think how much better the industry could be if people were getting paid correctly and were inspired to care about what they are doing.

I feel inspired by this field, but sometimes I see some stuff on here that turns me off a lot. Granted the majority of people want to share negative things. I like to imagine all the positive outlooks and experiences aren‚Äôt shared here. What do you guys think? Clinical research has to keep on going, but right now it seems like a crazy space.

I feel bad for feeling burnt out ,"Ranting, but also happy to hear other's advice and/or experiences. 

This'll be my 4th year as a CRA (3rd in my current position) and I feel symptoms of burn out. And I feel bad because my work conditions are pretty good. I have a wonderful, supportive LM and team. The trial managers that I work with are reasonable. And I actually look forward to taking to the site staff I work with. Travels and DOS are also reasonable. 

But since the new year hit, workload feels overwhelming. I have an oncology study that's transitioning from risk based monitoring to 100%, and I got another oncology study (different TA) with high enrollers. I'm excited for these studies, but it's kinda a lot.

I'm missing easy stuff and I'm now always anxious to start the day (hasn't been this way before 2024). 
I'll discuss with my LM. 

Anyone else in similar situation? I heard from colleagues that they feel burnt out as well, but have expressed that they're not that fond of their team/supervisor/manager.

Anyone else in data entry at the site level feel like they aren't respected as an employee?,"I've felt like this. I help manage all the studies at the site level with data entry. I'm talking dozens of studies. I'm not a coordinator as I've never been interested in being a coordinator. In addition to my data entry tasks I also back-up front desk and assist with calls. 

We're currently working a study that requires 24-hour turnaround time for data entry and are seeing over 40 patients in a two-day time window. Needless to say, on top of managing all the other studies (being the only one in my department) I'm fucking busy.

A coworker of mine needed help moving some things. I have no problems with doing that, but it was the way she said my name... like she was evaluating who was the least valuable. This was further clarified when a doctor offered to help and this coworker went ""No, we actually need you."" 

This feels really fucking petty to me to get annoyed over... but something about that pissed me off. Here I am, working my fucking ass off, getting all this data entry in accurately within a timely manner, and you somehow think I'm not as valuable as anyone else.

Fine. I'm sure all you lead coordinators would handle data entry just fine without me if I just fucking walked out, right? You lot clearly don't need me... I only... *checks notes*... handle data entry and query management for every study by myself, backup front desk, help you when you don't know why your computer/internet isn't working, etc... but fuck it... I'm sure you can handle all that without me just fine. 

Goddamn, I feel like I should be over this petty thought of mine. I'm obviously not gonna just up and quit because I have bills to pay... but I constantly feel overlooked in my position and that no one actually appreciates what I do.

How to Get a Clinical Research Job With ZERO Experience Checklist.,"
I‚Äôve had a lot of success cold emailing my way into interviews and jobs at clinical research sites and biotech startups. The best thing you could do is just get your foot in the door. You do that by offering value and willing to work for free- especially since you don‚Äôt have experience.

The good news is that after a few weeks, they will want to keep you on staff and will pay you. If not, well, now you have experience to leverage for a paid position elsewhere.

It‚Äôs a lucrative industry and ideally you should be constantly elevating your skillset while looking for bew opportunities every 9-12 momths.

‚ñ† Get GCP certified at https://gcp.nidatraining.org/ - this
can be done in 2 hours. This gives you a lot of credibility

‚ñ†Compile a list of 100 PI‚Äôs - Google ‚ÄòClinical Research sites‚Äô or check ClinicalTrials.gov

‚ñ†Catalog the information on a google sheets document (Site Name, Address, Phone
Number, Manger/ PI/Operations director.)

General Principles

The goal of a cold email is to get time, not to get hired. First, the person has to read your email.

Subject Line

Template: Prospect‚Äôs First Name | Your First Name intro ‚Äî job title

Example: Dr.Isaac | Omar intro ‚Äî research assistant

That subject line format works well and gets you over the first hurdle - actually getting someone to open the email. I always leave ‚Äúintro‚Äù and usually leave ‚Äújob title‚Äù uncapitalized because having every word capitalized feels a little salesy. Now you‚Äôre past the subject line, you need a convincing message that can be read without scrolling down on a phone.

Structure

- First paragraph ‚Äî make it clear why you‚Äôre emailing.

- Second paragraph ‚Äî tell your narrative and show credibility. - It‚Äôs important and just plain
pragmatic to be honest.

- Third paragraph ‚Äî focusing statement, explain your interest, make a clear ask.

The goal of a cold email is to get time, not to get hired. The most common mistake is
making the email too long. Make it concise and easy for the other person to read and help you.

A well-written cold email shares your narrative and answers the three big questions:

‚óè Why do you want to work here?
‚óè Why do you want this particular role?
‚óè Why now?

Who Should You Target?

If you are targeting a small company, let‚Äôs say under 20 employees, you want to email the PI
directly. If the company is slightly bigger then you should target the Director of Operations or the hiring manager.

Where Do You Get Their Email?

It‚Äôs very easy to guess someone‚Äôs email if they work in america. It is likely their email follows
one of the patterns below, the first two are more common.

*firstname@company.com* Most common at new, smaller companies.Most doctors have this email.

*firstname.lastname@company.com*
Most common at medium sized companies.

*firstinitial.lastname@company.com* Sometimes there is no period.

*firstname.lastinitial@company.com* Sometimes there is no period.

Technology

You can use tools like Name2Email, Hunter.io, and Skrapp.io to find or verify email addresses.I‚Äôve used all three in the past and I‚Äôd say Name2Email had the best results and fastest UX.

LinkedIn

LinkedIn is helpful to see what someone has shared or interacted with. You can use that
information to better tailor the narrative you‚Äôre putting in your email. You can also send cold
messages on LinkedIn but I find that folks check emails more often than LinkedIn messages.

CRA-helpful to someone!,"Hi everyone,  
I accepted an offer from IQVIA CRA school yesterday for the November cohort. The CRA school is nothing but CRA I with some intense training in the first couple of months. My interview consisted of TWO rounds.  
Initial screening by recruiter confirming everything on my CV is right. Also explained the position in detail like what training will be given etc.  
Second round had two people who went through my CV in detail asking about my experience.  
why you want to be a CRA  
Why IQVIA  
What are your current duties  
What is your experience in patient recruitment

What do you consider as SAE  
what are the characteristics of a ICF  
What are phase III trials  
Why do you think CRAs are important  


SCENARIOS  
If you find that the temperature log for medication was not working last week what would you do in your site visit  
What if you see that the latest ICF version is not signed by the study participant  
What did you do when there was an agreement with your co worker on something at the site  
what if the CRC is not responding to your request on a particular information from the site  


Do you have any big travel plans in the short future  
Do you have any travel restrictions

&#x200B;

The first round was 25 minutes and the second round was 55 minutes with some time for my questions. I usually do my interviews very good. Also rehearsed in front of mirror for some of the above questions. Salary offered was 83500. My background is TWO masters and a Phd, and a postdoc (involved duties of a CRC) all in health fields. Due to urgent relocation and some family issues, had to start working as a  RESEARCH ASSISTANT at a site, on contract with IQVIA. I just completed one year last week and although was a long shot to direct CRA than CRC, decided to try and asked for my LM recommendation for the school. I bargained hard since I understood they want me or they liked me! I explained the justification I need for 88k. Then there was a silence for couple of days. Yesterday they came back with 87k and I accepted.  Gt to know this is for the 'Lilly' FSP and I will be mostly in the west coast region. They have around 10 people in each cohort which i understand was filled. The next cohort starts in January last week. Good luck!

very important tip! Dont look at anything other than the interviewers during the video interview. I learnt that they dont select anyone who looks at some notes or pointers or anything away from the screen which might seem like a prompt to them!

If anyone can tell me more about CRA school and the Lilly FSP, workload etc.. would be great. Thanks",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/175jhmi/crahelpful_to_someone/,clinicalresearch,-0.9818480014801025
CRA Breaking,"Hey all, it is finally becoming that time for me I fear.  Unfortunately, I have only made it 2+ years since training as a CRA.  I still have my eyes set on a big payout set for me 3 years from now but I‚Äôd have to remain full travel.  I have another big bonus at the end of next month but I don‚Äôt believe even it will help my outlook at the moment.  

Anyways, I have no clue how anyone with my type of issues does this for a living for more than a few years, wish I could be one of those people.  I did not travel much my first year out of training because I got lucky with study assignments.  I always knew this would change and it would be very tough, but now I am here and at a loss for words.  Have traveled every week for the past month or so and I‚Äôm booked out through the end of October currently.  This next week/weekend will really push me to the edge with my schedule.  It‚Äôs weird, as I still haven‚Äôt been trapped into having to travel much on Fridays/Sundays, and I know that maybe most CRAs travel so much more than me, or at least so much more consistently given my last 2 years.  I feel like a piece of shit even complaining with still being so fresh and not having gone through the greater gauntlets of audits, DBLs, study closeouts, etc.  I am honestly at a loss for how people do this on a week to week basis if traveling more than me.  I can barely get myself out of bed anymore on the sparse days I‚Äôm not traveling, obviously that is 100% on me to fix and asap.

From two trips in one week to the brutalities of travel, how is it even remotely possible to survive for 5-10 years while fully resourced?  My major concerns recently have become eating enough calories per day given how travel physically feels and the typical late nights or long ass days in/out of airports.  Got one of the worst beds/rooms last night and just couldn‚Äôt sleep while much needed.  Let alone, the mountain of work that is consistently present while mutually exclusive from travel.  Supposed to have 4 hours worth of monthly/quarterly contacts done with 17 of my sites, but I‚Äôm over here looking at my infinite list of site contacts to file since I fell behind 1.5 years ago like lol.

The best thing PRA did was acquire a company called RPS. Their culture was almost second to none in my opinion. Great work life balance, vibe, retention rate. Obviously a lot changed after multiple acquisitions but I remember how awesome it was to work for them.(retired now)

As mentioned in the other thread their founder brought back that culture with a new company, TPS(transformative pharmaceutical services). They are probably the company I refer people to the most because of that culture and I know some old RPS employees they brought back. They brought on a whole new model for embedded site level employees too on top of their clin ops/ monitoring.

Is the travel for CRAs truly as awful as everyone says?,"I wanted a travelling job when I was getting ready to graduate college but then I met the person I will probably end up marrying. Then Covid arrived and the idea of travel scared me. Well it's almost 4 years later and my partner and I have built a life together and covid isn't as scary now that we have the covid research and data. 

I work in documentation coordination and management in a CRO and I've been thinking about my long term goals. I think I would like to travel a bit. But then I've heard of the ear stories and my mom has had a travelling job for decades and she is burnt out. But the difference is that we're not planning to have kids and technology has come so far that there are multiple ways to feel connected to loved ones back home. I've been working in research related roles for 5 years.

Guide to 21 CFR Part 11 Requirements for eReg / eSource ,"Having been in this career a while now, I‚Äôve found that this (part 11 / eSource / eReg) is one of the more challenging topics and I often get the feeling that the vast majority of people working in this field have misconceptions or poor understanding of the actual regulatory/GCP requirements. 

I‚Äôve often struggled a lot with the topic myself, but one of the best resources I have come across for better understanding the requirements in the U.S. actually comes from the eReg and eSource vendor Florence. 

They‚Äôve compiled a very useful guide that includes various questions about Part 11, eSource, and eReg that have been sent to the FDA, as well as the FDA‚Äôs responses to those questions. 

These are a matter of public record, but Florence has organized these questions and answers into a really useful format, with a table of contents that directs you to relevant topics. 

Normally you need to provide your name, email, etc to Florence and then they will email a link to the guide to you, however, I‚Äôve downloaded the PDF and added to Google Docs, where you can just click the below link to view it. I highly recommend that anyone working on clinical trials in the U.S. that doesn‚Äôt feel like they have a solid grasp of the requirements reviews it. 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X2M8_AG76vP_DD_jJ4KFQLaKg0UFZqn4/view?usp=drivesdk


Here‚Äôs some examples of the topics covered: 

**Certified Copies**

What is the FDA accepted definition of certified copies?

What are the current regulations regarding the ""verified process"" of certified copies? 

Who is the person who should verify that the information is original or sign and date the printed copy for a certified copy?

Can you rely on a certified copy that is housed in a system that is not Part 11 compliant?

Is there any recommended time-frame that the site should employ before destroying the original paper records after certified copies have been made?

Can certified copes be used in place of original paper records during an inspection? 

**Electronic Records**

Does Part 11 apply to electronic health records?
Are hospital EMRs required to be compliant with part 11?

Would FDA expect a site to grant monitors access to subject electronic records without additional steps (e.g. signing an access request form)

What is the guidance behind placing study documents into a subject's EMR?

Is there any issue of confidentiality involved regarding placing study documents into a subject's EMR?

Is it appropriate to scan the informed consent research into the EMR?

If copies of EMRs are printed out, do they need to be certified if access can be given to the EMR to verify it?

Can a monitor review EMRs if a site provides complete EMR access to all patients seen at an institution/ facility instead of limited access to their system for only the subjects who have signed an informed consent form to participate in a study?

Is the sponsor or sponsor representative (CRO) required to ensure that the EHR system used to collect source data is validated or meets Part 11 requirements? 

Can an investigative site only provide copies of EMRs and not direct/ indirect access to the study monitor or FDA inspector?

**Institutional Review Board**

Is it a requirement to have paper backups of regulatory documents, particularly IRB related documents?

Does the FDA's guidance on Electronic Source Data in Clinical Investigations apply to IRBs?

Are there any rules on how to archive IRB records?

Is the IRB documentation that the sponsor receives considered records under predicate rules?

**Printed Copies**

If a printed record from an electronic clinical chart identifies who created the data, when (day, month, year, and hour), and who printed it out (username, day, month year and hour) is it necessary to request the investigator to certify every printed copy? 

Are printed copies required to be signed and dated by CRA?

**Scanning** 

What is necessary to consider scanned files source documents?

What are the requirements that should be met by the system in case the site wants to destroy the primary source after scanning it into an electronic system?

documentation from the hospital?
Does a scanned copy of signed documents meet FDA regulations?

What are the requirements for sites scanning in documents and sending them to us electronically?

Can hard copies that have been scanned and double verified to ensure that they have been scanned correctly be destroyed?

Once a document with a wet ink signature is scanned and posted in the e TMF, is it
necessary to keep the original in a paper file?

Once I scan a copy in the eTMF with a date stamp and record of the person who uploaded it, can I shred the original?

When documents are printed out from an electronic system or when scanning a document, does the person who makes the copy need to sign/initial and date the copy to indicate it meets the requirements of a certified copy?

Can regulatory documents, such as the Form FDA 1572 and the Financial Disclosure Forms, be signed and scanned in for the internal files?

Having the 2 weeks talk with your LM,"Hey All,

I got a really competitive offer from a different CRO that's 15k over my current salary with a Title jump as well. And I've weighed out the pro and cons of the offer, and unless my current CRO can match the offer it would be silly of me to not take the other CROs offer. 

I've had the same LM since the beginning so I really respect her opinion, but I have to look after myself and my future. I have great coworkers other than one bad apple, and we all know how important people are in this industry, good coworkers are the difference between good days and bad alot of the time. 

How do I tell my LM that I need to take the other CROs offer if my current CRO can't/won't match it? How do I tell my study teams? 

How do you know if you're truly ready to take a big step forward? Maybe it's just imposter syndrome, or the fear of the devil I know vs the devil I dont. I know I'm a damn good CRA but idk.

Update: the other CRO kept sweetening the deal and my current CRO couldn't match. It was an emotional meeting with my LM but everyone including my LM and director told me to go.

CRA 69K salary offer worth it?,"Hello I‚Äôm looking for some advice. I‚Äôve been working at a CRO for a little over 3 years as a remote monitor and recently was approached by my manager for an opportunity to transition into a CRA 1 role. I was hesitant to say yes as I have no interest in traveling, however told them I would potentially be interested if the price was right. A few weeks went by and today I was informed that I got the promotion and that starting next month I would begin the CRA training program at a $69k salary‚Ä¶. For reference I currently make $64k and am fully remote with zero travel. I didn‚Äôt have super high hopes here (obviously wasn‚Äôt expecting to make 6 figures or anything) but I was honestly very surprised as this seems very low for a CRA 1 position and I truly do not know if it‚Äôs worth it. If the salary was higher I would have sucked up the travel and stayed in the role for at least a year for the experience, but at $69K, it feels not worth it. 

P.S I know I should be very grateful to have a job and to even be in this position, but just looking for some career advice. Thanks!

*EDIT* Huge thank you to everyone who responded! I really appreciate the different perspectives and advice. My plan is to counter and see what they come back with (doesn‚Äôt hurt to ask right?) and stick it out through the training program and see if I get any change in pay after then.

I haven't had this happen before in my 1.5 yrs of CRA work at a big CRO, so I'm wondering what others have experienced with this?


There is a problem site that I inherited and a sponsor representative came along for the visit. They thought I did a bad job managing this site that I inherited. This is a very micromanaging, negative tone sponsor. The request to remove me was blocked, but it's on my record and I'll have to ""improve"" despite all of the other work I've done. I'm really quite angry with this since I felt like I was set up to fail by my managers, and it might affect my performance review (you did way over on your DOS and have great metrics, but this sponsor made comments about you) and if there are layoffs, this won't look good. Part of me wants off this study and be re-assigned elsewhere since this study is miserable to work on.

Future job security for the US based roles at CRO/Sponsor,"Hi, all (writing from the throwaway account)!

For the past 5 years I have been working at 2 big CROs as PM/sPM (before that I was APL, and worked on the vendor side for several years).

In the past 6 months I have noticed a concerning trend of US (and west EU) roles being moved to countries where the workforce is cheaper. Both CROs I worked for had some isolated teams (TMF Specialist, Site Payment Team, IT support, part of DM, Safety teams, etc) based in India, LATAM, and Eastern Europe, but the new trend seems to be that CRA, CTA, PL, PD and other roles are also being affected. On the sponsor side, it's same, I did a quick search yesterday and several companies (J&J, Elly Lilly, Roche, AZ) had Study Manager openings mostly just for personnel based in India.

Do you think US/Western EU-based roles in Clinical Research will diminish in the next 5-10-15 years?

"Colleague accused of fraud. Is this legit, or is it a witch hunt?","So my colleague at work was on a multiple day onsite visit and signed the log for the past 2 days. As she was due back the next day, she also signed it in advance as the log was hard to get hold of.

Her colleague took a scan and sent it to the PM. She's now been told she's off the study due to her fraudulent action in future dating the visit log, and her job is jeopardy.

Is this really so bad she is deserving of this treatment, rather than being given a warning and the benefit of the doubt on this error in judgement? I feel this is a way over the top reaction, and cant find anything specifically mentioned in GCP or our SOPs around this...I dont suppose there is anything we can do about it either way, but interested to get other perspectives.



Edit: Thanks everyone. There's been some really interesting thoughts and perspectives. Good to hear sides of the story I had never thought about given I am biased to believe my colleague had no bad intent in mind. She did fully intend to go the next day, but the PM told her not to, kind of proving the point that you can't guarantee you will attend the next day.

She is relatively new to the company, so there may be more to it OR it could just be a red flag to management and now there are concerns generally over her technical skills. I still think it was pure naivete and she just wasn't thinking after a stressful day (issues with IT resulting in 2 other monitors onsite being hostile towards her) but I am obviously only getting one side of the story.

For me the way she has been treated and management have handled it so far... it has been a bit of a red flag for me as a bystander.

Advice for people who hopped CROs (CRA particularly),"Throwaway here! I am currently working at PPD as a Sr CRA and have only ever worked at PPD.

Pros for switching: better pay, FSP role so better WLB and opportunities to move, clean slate

Cons: Downgrade in benefits (accrue PTO vs. discretionary), company culture is a big thing for me and I'm not so sure about ICON's

I still have to see how the interview goes, but what are some things that I should consider for a switch?   Any experiences from people at PPD/ICON or who have jumped ship?

What do you need in order to be a ‚ÄúPharmacist‚Äù?,"I‚Äôm a CRA (still feeling very new after 8 months in the job). I have a site who have one person delegated as their unblinded pharmacist. However, when I looked at their CV, I saw that their bachelors degree is in Economics, rather than a life-sciences field, and their only previous work experience was as a pharmaceutical sales rep.

My CRO has emphasized that this study is incredibly high priority for the sponsor. The drug being studied is administered via infusion, and the UB pharmacist is responsible for compounding/formulating the dose before handing it off to the blinded team for administration. 

Given the high-profile of the study plus the increased risk of infection that comes with infusions (vs. oral admin, injection, etc), I feel a bit concerned that the pharmacist‚Äôs qualifications don‚Äôt line up with what I expected for that role.

The trial manager sent out a memo, after other people raised similar concerns, saying that we should just trust that the sponsor did their due diligence of ensuring staff qualifications during site selection. If we still had concerns, they said we should consult with the sponsor CDC. 
I tried to ask my sponsor CDC what the local regulations were for dispensing drugs in that state, but I‚Äôve been met with radio silence. I even called the state‚Äôs pharmacy licensing board to ask whether it‚Äôs okay for people to dispense/formulate drug without a pharmacist license, but all I get are answering machines and no callbacks. The state regulations I found are so dense that I can‚Äôt find the answers on my own.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. And I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm overthinking things. I‚Äôve had sites delegate nurses to formulate drug before, but never someone without a science background.

EDIT: Thank you so much for your responses everybody! I appreciate all the explanations for the difference between clinical settings and research setting when it comes to this topic. I‚Äôll be making sure there‚Äôs clear documentation available in the site file (and my personal correspondence history) for confirming this person‚Äôs delegation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/xh155x/what_do_you_need_in_order_to_be_a_pharmacist/,clinicalresearch,-0.9981932044029236
Career Progression after being a CRA,"I am currently a CRA II at a big CRO. I am interested in study design and the data side of clinical research. 

In a few years down the road I am looking to get a job that involves less travel (some travel acceptable-just not weekly like the CRA role).

The only natural career progressions I can think of are into the CTM role, although I am sure there are other clinical research roles out there to consider and apply for.

What jobs are exist that often hire previous CRAs that involve less travel (Sponsor or CRO side both acceptable)? Do these jobs require additional education beyond a bachelor‚Äôs degree? Would this be a promotion or should I expect a pay cut from going to a more remote role?",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/um758i/career_progression_after_being_a_cra/,clinicalresearch,-0.998537540435791
"I had a troubling and unprofessional conversation with my people manager(COM). She suggested I speak to her superior about it and her superior is disregarding the hostile and unprofessional behavior, insisting that we ""work it out"".","Context: I started my cra career in Mar2021 and I was completely lost the entire training period and a bit stressed. I was a CRC so I was new to the position and company.¬† My manager was consistently absent and unsupportive to the point that in asked to be paired with a mentor in a non-threatening/non-confrontational way. I thought it might be a conflict free solution to my feeling unsupported. she refused this request saying she was all I should need. My saving grace came when I was put on a study with an outstanding CTM who honestly deserves all the praise in the world(I would follow her into battle). We would have 1:1s when my COM would cancel mine saying she's busy and never reschedule. 

During a team meeting in October my COM said we were welcome to change to a different COM if we felt we weren't getting enough support. We could¬†just let her know and she would facilitate the transfer... I know very odd company policy. 

I then received an email from my COM stating that my metrics were unsatisfactory and that I was currently in non-compliance. If the trend continued I would be placed in SWAT by January. SWAT basically has you doing visits on random studies for a day or two. Full protocol training on those studies is also required for just those few days you are monitoring... I was shocked because she was doing end of the year reviews which prompted that email. The trouble was I knew this information on my metrics wasn't right and it wasn't the first or even second time my COM had incorrect information about my metrics. Unfortunately this time came with very real consequences though. I emailed her about the mistake and she admitted the metric information was incorrect. I also sent an email to her voicing my desire to change COMs on 01Dec21.

I get a call a few hours after the email in which my COM was clearly livid and yelling. The conversation included threats on my year review and my career at the company. She said she knows all of the other people Managers and she would place me with someone I would have a bad time with(I have no idea what that means). She said she would put in my review, I don't like to work etc.(For context I'm averaging ~10.5 days on site a month and company policy is 9.5 days on site).  When she asked me how was she not supportive as a COM, I tried to explain how I felt and was interrupted several times with her yelling ""Liar! Liar! That's a lie!"" Several times I calmly said "" I feel uncomfortable, this is aggressive, this is unprofessional, can you please stop."" She then suggested if I had promblem with the call go ahead and report it to her manager.¬† 

A month and three emails later I get an email response from her manager saying ""Those are very serious accusations you are making and I left a voice message on your phone right before the holidays and you should accept my meeting."" So I went back and found the voice message saying to call her back but my phone never registered her call. It just saved her voicemail without even notifying me there was a call or message. 

After listening to the message I called my COM's manager and the first thing she said to me was ""What is your interpretation of the conversation?"" I told her everything I had documented and she said my COM had already spoken to her and has given her a different story and that she believes her manager. When I explained why I didn't think its a good idea to stay with my COM after she threatened my career at the company she said no one changes COMs and it's only happened once under her watch in 10 years. She continued to say I must work it out with my manager and she trusts my manager will not do anything harmful, despite the extemely unprofessional and hostile conversation. During my call with my COM's supervisor I asked why my COM would offer the ability to switch to another person if it was not typically done. She responded with ""I don't know, its not company policy"".

I was thinking I should recap this phone conversation in an email for documentation and then state that I would only speak to my COM on a recorded Webex moving forward but I don't want any trouble as I am new and just want to put my head down and learn to do my job well.

I'm not sure what I should do now. Should I reach out to HR? Should I start looking for a CRAI position at a different company? Am I missing something here? Any and all advice would be helpful in navigating this issue. I honestly love my job, but I'm definitely not in good hands. I've noticed that I no longer get weekly metrics reports, updates, and team meeting invites.¬† I have been independently reaching out to my COM to get all of that info, which used to come automatically. Opportunities she once mentioned were available that would enable me to get more bonuses have been taken off the table. I am now getting emails asking if I can do SWAT,... so she still must have moved forward and placed me on that list.

I haven't seen my end of year review. But she has assured everyone on the team meeting that everyone is fine.

Once again, any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

If it helps: currently I'm an unblinded CRA1(@ CRO) who started last March. 

Thanks everyone!

Syneos CRA release process? ,"Hi! 

I was just wondering if any CRAs have experience with Syneos Health Role removal process when a client requests the removal of a CRA? Basically a client (new to clinical research realm) who had been too hands on with the start of a study and saying questionable and unethical things to sites (as far as what they could do) was upset because I did not want to do 3 SIVs in three different states in the same week while completing reports from two SIVs from the week prior. They were rushing to get sites activated because it took Syneos too long to get the study started. Without having any write-ups on file the Client requested I be removed from the study because I wanted to do 2 SIVS that holiday week instead of 3. I was removed from the study at the client‚Äôs request and HR told me that because the client requested I be removed from the study I could no longer be a CRA. They completely removed me from my CRA role and told me I have two weeks to secure another position in the company or they would be separating from me, One week paid and One week unpaid. Needless to say I was let go because two weeks is not enough time to have your application reviewed and do an interview with another department. I have worked for 3 different CROs so this procedure threw me off. My question is ‚Äúis this a normal procedure at Syneos Health?‚Äù 

I was also told not to share this conversation with anyone outside of HR. 

To be clear I did report to my LM the things the Client was saying and telling sites to do without getting clarification from the CRO regarding legalities/ IRB approval/ site activation requirements and her response was ‚Äúits the clients and they are paying‚Äù.

Job gave me written warning and held a meeting about performance,"Hello, I am a CRA at a mid-sized CRO and recently got some concerning feedback. Some backstory: i am doing mostly COVs for sites that have never been monitored. This is not a fun job and results in MANY action items Post-COV. Per our policy, action items are to be closed 15 days after COV. The spinsor does not want them closed like that. Some of these action items have been open for over 9 months, and they become non-responsive then randomly respond and dont provide requested items. Sponsor policy is to send a certified letter after X number of non-responses, which is why they have dragged out so unbelievably long. It appears my COM (manager) didn't make me aware of performance issues for around 6 months, which resulted in issues getting me resourced to new projects. I was made aware of this about 3 weeks ago when I met with my new manager. I have documentation that I had asked why I wasn't being resourced, and if there was any issue with performance to both my project team (NA lead, regional lead, etc...) that complained about me and also asked my manager, of which there was no response. Should I start looking for a new job? This is just a verbal warning with email follow up, not a PIP.

Industry Clinical Research Incentivizes Shady Recruitment Practices,"Clinical research has a recruitment problem. Simultaneously, the participant population is not large or diverse enough, and yet I see too often subjects that aren‚Äôt appropriate for the trial.

Sponsors only select investigators that can recruit, investigators multiply their accounts-receivable with each additional subject, and subjects are desperate for compensation, so they aren‚Äôt truthful about their situations.

I‚Äôve completed several site selection visits where I didn‚Äôt recommend a site, but later found out that it was selected because they fabricated their recruitment rate. 

I‚Äôve worked with many sites that operate on the presumption that a subject qualifies *no matter what* and will only rule them out if there‚Äôs objective third-party reasoning. I have a visceral memory about my manager as a coordinator getting upset with me because I notified a PI about a subject not qualifying, that they were about to enroll. I thought I did the right thing, but was actually scolded about it. I‚Äôve seen too many ‚Äúnot clinically significant‚Äù even to believe the phrase has any meaning. I had a situation where a subject had an abnormal ECG and labs that, in conjunction, point towards a cardiac event, only for the PI to say ‚ÄúNCS‚Äù  and randomize because the exclusion relies on their judgment. 

Too often, I‚Äôve had sites discover that lost-to-follow-up gave a fake address because they entered the trial out of desperation for compensation. Just last week, there was a post in this sub about a Velocity ad that explicitly advertised about getting compensated. I‚Äôm always a little worried when I get to a site, and there‚Äôs a sign about ‚Äúpayment cards‚Äù. To be clear, I am not against compensating subjects. I am against preying on populations that make a compromised decision to receive an experimental medication, or are sensitive about incentives to lie about medical history.

And I know there are legitimate, good-faith actors out there trying to do the right thing, and many highly ethical sites that have weird situations pop up. But when the only compulsion to properly vet subjects is integrity and there exists incentives to recruit as many as possible, it's inevitable that the industry is going to skew towards impropriety.

Am I crazy to see the whole industries vertical as broken?

"If you had a matter of hours to teach years‚Äô worth of CRC/regulatory knowledge to someone, what are your resources and how do you break it down so they get the most from you?","Yeah, that‚Äôs right. It says what it says, and it sounds crazy when I read it out loud. But alas, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm about to do because my site is exploding, and every seasoned coordinator will have exited by the end of next week. I have promised the people I‚Äôm leaving behind who have never been coordinators or worked in research before that I‚Äôll try to give them as much knowledge as possible. If you‚Äôve read this far you‚Äôre probably thinking ‚Äúwow, super unethical,‚Äù and trust me my heart is there too. But I don‚Äôt own the site, there are no leaders or oversite, and no communication. I have no other attachment other than I care for the people I‚Äôm leaving this burden on, and I truly care about ethical research and the subjects.

So I‚Äôm going to do my best, but my site has no SOP‚Äòs, no workflows, and absolutely zero resources. If you had to do this, how would you go about it? And do you have any particular CRC online resources I can send them to, or at least gather visuals from? At my site CRC‚Äôs are responsible for everything, including start up, all monitoring visits, full regulatory submissions/ISF maintenance, consent, training documentation, DOA, 1572, full data entry, and for patient coordination, progress notes, and protocol adherence. CRCs literally do it all, and these ones have done none.  

I just want to efficiently stream line this and give them the most I possibly can in the most limited time I have. How would you map this out? Any online resources I can send them yo or get good visuals and examples from you recommend?

I made a site that visualizes clinical trials - looking for some feedback,"Hey all, I've been working on a website that visualizes clinical trials from the clingov database. Quite a lot of patients/consumers look at clinical trials, so I made this tool to make sense of the results. In particular, it would be great if you guys could help me answer a few questions:   


* Does the site look professional (i.e. does it look like a legit website - not something some guy just made)?
* Is the information for an individual study complete?
   * Are summary statistics necessary for interpreting the results? 
* Is the study cool to look at?

Pro‚Äôs & Con‚Äôs of job hopping in clinical research,"Any CRA‚Äôs have experience job hopping CRO‚Äôs or sponsors ? I‚Äôve been with my current company for ~10 months, I came from clinical research in animal health vaccines (fairly atypical career path so far).

I am not unhappy with my current company, but I basically have 0 interest in the therapeutic area of the studies I am assigned. My company does not require us to have cameras on for meetings, and I‚Äôve had 4 managers in the 10 months I‚Äôve been here, so I really have no personal connections to anyone within my company, just plugging away doing my thing. My metrics for this year are probably not going to look that great as my workload was light at the beginning of the year while onboarding.

I‚Äôm having a hard time not considering jumping to another CRO when recruiters are reaching out almost weekly, saying I have enough experience to jump to a Sr CRA / CRA III position which brings with it a sign on bonus and better salary.

The way I see it:

Pro‚Äôs:
1. better pay, more prestigious title(not sure how much this one matters)
2. Potential to choose therapeutic area I am actually interested in
3. No personal relationships at current job- won‚Äôt be hard to leave unlike previous jobs where I was very close with co-workers

Cons
1. Potentially burning a bridge with current CRO?
2. May be biting off more than I can chew to gain more salary - might just be imposter syndrome speaking, but it still feels like I am learning new things all of the time in my current role.. I haven‚Äôt completely ‚Äúmastered‚Äù it

What comes next?,"I‚Äôve been in the industry for about 7 years now and I‚Äôm beginning to really hate it.

Things changed at work with the pandemic and it‚Äôs all been downhill from there.  Between the ‚Äúeverything needs to be done yesterday‚Äù mentality that I see across the board and the lack of support due to resourcing constraints that never seem to ease, I think it‚Äôs time to move out of the industry all together if for nothing else but my mental health.

I will be really thankful if anybody with more experience can share their view.

Paying It Forward: Free SAS/R/Stats Sessions,"Hey Everyone!

Hope fall has been treating you well. :)

Just to introduce myself first:

I am an experienced  Clinical Data Management professional. I worked with a large CRO for a few years, and had to leave my organisation for multiple reasons. I wanted a domain change and it wasn't possible to study with a full-time job. The work culture became too overwhelming for me and I genuinely needed a break.

During this period, I have upskilled in SAS Base, SAS Advanced and further was involved in projects using SDTM, ADAM and TLF concepts. While, I may not be the best, I have also learned  R Programming for Clinical Research, Advanced Biostatistics, and Basic Machine Learning Algorithms.(Biostats with ML is what I am most bullish about!)

In order to keep myself motivated during Q4, I am hoping to provide free either SAS, R or/and Biostats until the end of November! There are NO hidden charges and this is not a spam in any way. There is a lot of time, energy and money that I have spent on skill development; however, call it the hiring freeze, rejections, or overall market sentiment being a spirit dampener; It has been extremely difficult for me to stay positive. Hoping this will help me and you!

I would love to have a quick chat with all those who are interested over a zoom call on November  1, Friday, so I can explain how each of the course will flow and what topics will I be covering. Will get back with the exact time!

Should you be interested, please do the following as a comment or a direct message.

1. Please tell me what is your background with programming and statistics, so I can better understand what is the profile I am dealing with. If you aren't experienced, feel free to let me know your  work/education background.

2. What are you most interested in? 
A. SAS Base and Advanced,
B. Advanced Biostatistics using SAS, 
C. R programming

3. What timezone are you based in? 

4. I will most probably be scheduling classes Mon-Friday over zoom in one of the following slots, depending upon interest, demand and other factors. Let me know, which would  you prefer. 

A.   Somewhere between 7.30 am PST- 10.30 am
B.   Somewhere between  7.30 pm PST- 10.30 pm

5. There will be no classes on the weekends. Moreover, I will not provide any recordings!

Happy Halloween! ;)

"I took on the Chair of the IRB, and I won.","The debate was the regulatory difference between human subject research and a quality improvement project. I'm going to celebrate now, bye.

\----

UPDATE: Here's the debate summary; thank you to GPT for helping me summarize this. **It's important to note that HHS does define ""quality improvement"" through the following laws:**   

* **45 CFR 158.150** defines what constitutes healthcare quality improvement activities.
* **45 CFR 158.151** provides more detailed criteria regarding which activities are considered quality improving, including provisions to prevent the inclusion of activities that can be categorized as administrative.

**Note**: HHS 45CFR46 ""the Common Rule"" provides 4 essential questions to answer if a project is human subject research:

1. does the activity involve *research* ([45 CFR 46.102(d)](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html#46.102(d)));
2. does the research activity involve human subjects ([45 CFR 46.102(f)](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html#46.102(f)));
3. does the human subjects research qualify for an exemption ([45 CFR 46.101(b)](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/regulations/45-cfr-46/index.html#46.102(b))); and
4. is the non-exempt human subjects research conducted or supported by HHS or otherwise covered by an applicable FWA approved by OHRP.

**Early Exchanges:**

1. A proponent with an academic appointment at the university and a clinical provider at my medical center approached my team at our medical center for the implementation of a quality improvement project. The proponent only included the university in the framework for budgeting their wage and benefits for their contributions to the project.
2. The university's IRB Chair contested the project's classification as ""quality improvement."" Concerns included:

\- Project's Designation: The IRB Chair questioned if the primary intent of the quality improvement could categorize the project as ""human subjects research"" given the broader implications of its findings.

\-Publication Intent & Generalizable Knowledge: This critical point was raised that publishing the project's findings might position the data as contributing to ""generalizable knowledge,"" influencing its research designation.

3. I responded, clarifying the project‚Äôs chief aim, emphasizing that its findings, while potentially beneficial for other healthcare institutions, were not framed as ""human subjects research."" I referenced HHS's stance: ""Planning to publish an account of a quality improvement project does not necessarily mean that the project fits the definition of research.""

4. The Manager of Grants and Contracts for the university's Office of Sponsored Programs and Administration (OSPA) and the Regulatory Affairs Specialist joined the discussion. The engagement of these three university members, each with their specific expertise, added depth and complexity to the debate.

**The Climax:**

5. The IRB Chair emphasized the rigor of their institution's IRB determination process. In my counter-argument, I detailed how the project aligns with being outside the federal law in 45 CFR 46. I accentuated that my medical center's IRB determination questions were even more in-depth than the HHS requirements, ensuring the project's alignment outside of federal law regarding human subject research while aligning with broader ethical considerations.

6. The IRB Chair mentioned an upcoming meeting with his team to consider the project under the lens of the state guidelines and regulations provided by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. Taking the initiative, I meticulously researched each regulation the department flagged for human subject research and subsequently elucidated how our quality improvement project aligns outside of each specific regulation as a quality improvement project.

During this climax, the intense 24-hour period of debate saw rigorous scrutiny from both sides.

How can I get into clinical research?,"Hi,

I am a blind woman who just graduated last month with an MS in Biological Science with a Neuroscience focus. I also have a BS in Neuroscience. Clinical research is an area I am looking into for work. The only potential challenge I see (üòÇüëÄ) is drawing blood/other tasks like that which I do not feel comfortable doing. Other than that, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have other challenges based on the many job descriptions I‚Äôve read. 

What can I do now to get into clinical research and land my first job? What job titles should I search for? Also, how can I strengthen my resume and LinkedIn profile to be noticed more?

FYI: Computers have screen readers that read whatever the cursor goes over and/or whatever is on the website as you scroll through it using keyboard commands. You can even change the speaking rate and read by character, word, line, paragraph and so on. Reading time and the data, spelling of acronyms and words will not be an issue.

I appreciate any and all advice. Thank you in advance!

There is a massive disconnect between the people who design data entry systems and the clinics who use them.,"And honestly, as an RA whose role is data entry it's getting really irritating. There is clearly no consideration made towards those of us who actually enter data in these systems. They make sweeping changes that often times makes our job less efficient and more time consuming than it should be.

The systems are often times clunky, slow, and act like they haven't been updated since 2007. Hell, one system I use looks like they used a fucking style guide manual from 2005...

I just get so tired of it. And it's not one big thing either. It's a bunch of tiny annoying shit that adds up over time.

And I know I'm not the only one with these complaints. CRCs and the like have also shared similar concerns with the systems they use and general sweeping changes that tank job efficiency.

questions about a weird interview as a clinical scientist,"Hi all,

I just finished an interview with ExecuPharm (a parexel company) yesterday. 

The hiring manager asked for detailed information about my skills and experiences in clinical development such as protocol preparation and data management plan, and clinical operation such as schedule of the clinical trials, eTMF/eCRF, etc. 

The weirdest thing is that when I ask why the role is open, HM replied that we just interview ahead and will put you on a waiting list if we think you are qualified. If there is a role open,  we will contact you immediately and see if you want to join us at that time. But HR did not tell me anything about this before the interview.

Honestly, I never saw this hiring procedure before and wonder how efficient it will be. Is it a normal procedure in CRO?

I despise this field‚Äî what other career options do I have where my skills are easily transferable?,"Title says it all. I absolutely hate this field. I work at a large institution which will go unnamed. It has a prestigious reputation, but behind closed doors it‚Äôs a sh!t show. Turnover rates are insane (>60%) and everyone hates their job. Management is atrocious and does nothing to help.

I‚Äôve considered moving into pharma or a CRO, but based on my experience I don‚Äôt have much faith. This field is insufferable. You‚Äôre constantly correcting people‚Äôs mistakes‚Äî query after query (some from YEARS ago), which are highly insignificant in the grand scheme of things yet a massive headache to deal with. I‚Äôm also sick of everything being a deviation or reportable event. Most of these patients couldn‚Äôt care less if the nurse accidentally took an additional sample, yet we HAVE to report it which creates a ton of paperwork. And did I mention the pay is trash? Why am I working so hard for peanuts? 

11 of my colleagues have left within the past month. Some have made lateral moves to other hospitals, while others have gone back to school. A few have gone to pharma. I am open to school to learn new skills, but I‚Äôm not sure what. I currently have a BSc in epidemiology and SOCRA.

If I could build on my current healthcare experience I wouldn‚Äôt mind, I‚Äôm just not sure what my options are. Based on my experience I would like a job that values creativity and innovation. I can‚Äôt stand how restrictive this field is with its countless illogical SOPs (which is also a major driving force in why everyone leaves our hospital).

Friendship/mentorship community for new CRA's,"Hey y'all,

So this question has probably been asked 1,000x on here before (mods feel free to delete but read my next sentence first) but...I want to be successful at this job. And I can't do it alone - I've got Asperger's.

My goal was the whole BSN degreee -> ICU for two years -> nurse anesthetist route. Nursing school = easy peasy. ICU = less easy peasy. COVID + being broke + having a disability you yourself didn't really understand and only learned about day by day through trial and error - I am kissing the very ground I walk on that Monday I start my first day as a CRA.

I can't do this alone though, I need a village. I've unfortunately had people close to me whom could help me give up on me and this may be my last shot (I'm in the US and by last shot I mean my family is talking social security/disability).

&#x200B;

While social media was first talking about IG, SC, OF, TikTok, Discord, etc. I was either studying or at work busting my ass so I have no idea what any of those really mean.

With that being said, would anyone want to start a support group? And by support group I mean a legitimate support group?

EDIT: About me - I've got AS but I've been one of those dudes whose been burned so many times because of the the AS that you wouldn't really notice it unless you tried really hard (therapy has helped mucho), I'm state-side so my answers to you might come at odd hours, I actually paid one of these CRO's a crapload to take their training programs - boy am I glad I did it) and I'd rather learn more about you than talk about myself.

EDIT 11 Nov 2021: Wow, the response to this has been totally awesome and badass. I feel like a real douche because - while I've been meaning to create this via telegram, discord, or on whatever platform that's easy to communicate with - I've been enduring 2+ weeks of MS Teams training calls that have lasted for at least 10 hours a day. The life has been sucked out of me to the point where if I start talking about termination visits just one more time I'm going to lose my shit.

That being said - this group is going to happen. The supply for people like us willing to do the work of ppl like us = high. The demand of people like us = high. The potential to rise is increasing. The potential to get more assignments is increasing.

I can't do this all myself. If someone would be willing to work with me to make a Discord or even better a telegram since it would be anonymous (as much as it could to my belief) I'd back it up & join it.

There are SOP's for everything-but at the end of the day there's always the unpredictable human element; and it's that unpredictable human element that can literally make it or break it no matter how good or bad you are as a CRA. The whole point of this is to prevent this from happening,

EDIT: 16 Nov 2021: Yeah...this training/hiring/onboarding frenzy is driving me into a wall free-time wise. Plenty of y'all awesome people have offered to help create a Discord. That would be awesome if someone would on my behalf because it's going to be a while before I get a chance to do it myself.

I can't speak for all CRO's but mine is hiring like crazy right now & is holding training sessions in multiple time zones across the globe in multiple languages each day to the point where they can't keep up. I'm not trying to flaunt it but this is a hard field to get into. However - and this is what I've been told - once you're in you can make a niche for yourself.

Informed consent question from a newbie,"UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your input!  I ended up emailing the IRB and inquiring, they pointed me to their guide for researchers and said if my issue didn‚Äôt meet their criteria for reporting, that I don‚Äôt need to report unless the sponsor or IRB want me to.  Both have told me I don‚Äôt need to report, so I‚Äôm just changing our practice to match the consent and going forward from there!  I appreciate this group!

I‚Äôve been a CRC for all of 2 months.  Came in with zero experience and got 4 whole hours of training from the person who had my position before me.  It‚Äôs been a lot of self teaching.  I do know my PI though, as I used to work for him as an RN.  

Anyway‚Ä¶the way I was trained is that the CRC before me was sending gift cards out at the end of the study period (a set amount for each visit and cumulative).  I haven‚Äôt had a patient visit since I started so haven‚Äôt needed to deal with the compensation piece.  However, I just had a patient point out to me that the consent says the gift cards will be sent out after each visit.  So I discussed with our COO (who oversees the gift cards), and I‚Äôm going to change the way we are sending out gift cards to match what it says on the consent.

One of the things I try to do when traveling for work is just to at least get out in the city for at least one night, grab a drink somewhere, some good food, and just wander.

For me so far my favorite site to spend time in has had to be Swedish Cancer Center in Seattle. Specifically their First Hill Campus. Not only is the staff there so incredibly friendly and helpful, but their location is almost unbeatable. 

They have an amazing donut place (Top Pot) right across the street, Starbucks right next to it and a Potbelly Sandwiches for lunch! And the fact that it straddles both the Capitol Hill and First Hill Neighborhoods means there is plenty to do. 

My personal favorite is to catch the bus from my hotel up to Olive Way, grab a drink at Montana Bar, then a taco or two at Carmelo‚Äôs tacos and from there maybe go axe throwing or wander towards Pike and Pine to have my pick of the food and bars to meet people and talk.

Any FSP workers ever caught hearing the sponsor they are embedded with internally ragging on the CRO they work for? ,"I am FSP. I really enjoy my team and what I do. I happen to be in a finance role so my trial loads get added to as fast or faster than the ones that close. It‚Äôs honestly strange this is an FSP option and not offered exclusively in house.

I honestly check my CRO email once a day and meet with my actual manager once a month. No complaints there. The sponsor loves the FSP side. However, they do have several trials outsourced to the CRO for full service. I still monitor their budget expenses on those studies but as a representative of the sponsor and not the CRO. They complain about them constantly. It‚Äôs awkward because the vast majority completely forget or have no idea myself and others actually work for the CRO they bitch about. Frankly, I completely understand their frustrations and don‚Äôt see why the CRO doesn‚Äôt tap us for some ‚Äúinsider info‚Äù lol. I mean we could help them repair relationships. We can provide them with areas to focus on that are irritating the sponsor. Instead, the sponsor is bringing studies in house and hiring more FSP workers.

- communication issues (mostly written) with timezones and language barriers 
- forecast accuracy
- timeliness on contract modifications and change orders
- forecast accuracy again
- turnover
- outsourcing (see first complaint)

Is Clinical Research your forever job?,"I‚Äôve had 3 jobs in research, one was great! Industry sponsored early detection with a great team but horrible pay. I moved onto a better paying regulatory job in peds oncology. The work is ok, the pay is slightly better but the culture is horrible! My supervisor is giving single white female vibes and has made me very uncomfortable. So I‚Äôm moving to a new job with similar pay but in a different institution. 

The whole thing has kinda disillusioned me with research, the fact that I‚Äôm not the first person they‚Äôve made uncomfortable enough to leave. I‚Äôm having a hard time figuring out if all of research is like this‚Äîor if it‚Äôs just corporate America.

So I‚Äôm wondering if clinical research is your forever job or a stepping stone to something else?

Edit: people keep asking about the Single White Female comment. Single White Female is a 1992 American psychological thriller film. Basically stalker vibes she looked up my phone number from the employee file to text me when I called in sick. I had already sent a doctor‚Äôs note but she felt the need to ask if I was out because in a deadly car crash. 
She‚Äôs super weird about wanting to know my address (I didn‚Äôt update it when I moved because she‚Äôs sent ‚Äúgifts‚Äù to ppl at their houses). We are not even work friends, she‚Äôs twice my age. If it was a male coworker with this power dynamic and strange interest in me, I don‚Äôt think anyone would be hesitate to think it‚Äôs weird.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1bz9e0f/is_clinical_research_your_forever_job/,clinicalresearch,-0.9970600008964539

Moffitt Oncology,"Hey! Genuinely curious and 100% not throwing shade.  Questions are always welcome from study sites, especially in oncology research.  I've noticed that staff at Moffitt ask an unusually high number of questions, and in rapid fire order.  Email will contain a nicely written inquiry about a protocol, with organized questions, numbered and very polite.  I take the time to answer them all, only to get an immediate response back saying thank you and then 3-5 more questions.  This trends over 3 separate protocols at this site and from different site staff.  I'm honestly just curious...are staff at Moffitt just trained to ask questions?  Everyone seems very nice and perfectly professional, but I spend more time w/ this site then all others assigned to me combined.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/18t24hr/moffitt_oncology/,clinicalresearch,0.9964221715927124
What is a good/bad LM?,"I've never really put much thought into my LM - they are pretty hands off unless it involves my (and probably their) metrics. Any question I have is usually study related and better directed towards my CTM. Questions in general they usually A) don't know the answer or B) take so long to respond I just don't even ask them anymore. I've heard of super micromanaging LM's, so I've always held a happy thought and been thankful.

Recently, however, I've begun to rethink the laissez-faire attitude of my LM. I've heard from other CRA's that their LM's fight for them to get raises/promotions and provide support. I have very little relationship with my LM outside of our awkward biweekly calls where they say ""good job, keep up the metrics"". 

I don't really know what a good LM is. I don't even know what a bad LM is. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/17098rd/what_is_a_goodbad_lm/,clinicalresearch,-0.9946267008781433

"Difficult Sites, Neglectful Management, and CRA Burnout","Hi there, everyone. I'm currently a CRA 1 and have been monitoring for 1.5 years. I've been in clinical research for a total of 5 years and worked at 2 large CROs in their FSP programs. 

I am finding more and more that no matter how much I overperform and prove my worth to CROs and Sponsors, I receive little to no support when dealing with difficult sites (i.e. sites with a known track record for protocol and GCP compliance issues, extensive amounts of CAPAS, poor documentation practices, etc.), especially if the site is high enrolling. It feels like my higher-ups just turn a blind eye to the issues I raise and this has happened multiple times with different sites at 2 large CROs now. When I ask for support, workload readjustments, and advocate for myself, I am also temporarily pacified by promises of support and then brushed off shortly after by my manager and the study team.

 It doesn't seem to matter if I have documentation, a paper trail, or even if the Sponsor and CRO are aware of the site's poor track record. I am still used as the scape goat and my mistakes are the only things that are addressed. I am in a conflicted headspace right now. While I love this industry and my job, it is extremely difficult to do my job when I have little to no support whenever I do ask for help or voice a concern. I am starting to wonder if I should just leave the industry altogether or at least find a different, non-CRA role.

For those of you who have made it to more senior positions after having been a CRA, how did you last that long and was it worth it? What mindset did you develop to help you push through those difficult times? Any and all advice is most appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/148rb1p/difficult_sites_neglectful_management_and_cra/,clinicalresearch,-0.9977325201034546
Almost 5 months without a job now,"Hi again,

It‚Äôs almost 5 months since I‚Äôve been laid off. I‚Äôm feel like I‚Äôm running out of places to apply for a position I have experience in. 

I‚Äôm just wondering what you guys‚Äô opinion on this conundrum is‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôve been applying to almost 100 places now. I keep applying for positions that I have experience in. (Regulatory coordinator, clinical trial assistant, research coordinator (different from a standard CRC)). It seems useless to even try to apply to other things (I have tried though) since employers are so picky about wanting to hire someone with previous experience in that position. So what do I do? I was searching for jobs again yesterday and I couldn‚Äôt even find any more clinical trial assistant jobs or regulatory coordinator jobs. So what do I do now? It‚Äôs so frustrating that I know I have strong work ethic, I know I always give the best quality work out of most people, and I always try my best and I can‚Äôt even put my skills to use and can‚Äôt prove that I would be a great asset to their company. 

I don‚Äôt exactly know what kind of answer I‚Äôm looking for but I would prefer not to get answers that are unhelpful/hateful. What have people in my position done?",https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/13hz1x3/almost_5_months_without_a_job_now/,clinicalresearch,-0.9993188381195068

Shot myself in the foot...,"I applied for the Parexel CTC position (remote) that was posted on Friday, but I realized I didn't like how my resume appeared in the application (I parsed from my resume and there was pagination that shouldn't have been there inside one of my job description boxes). I wanted to go back in and edit it, but the only option was to cancel my application.

""Fine,"" I thought, ""I'll just take it out and put it back in the way I wanted it to look.""

So I withdrew my application and now Workday won't let me reapply at all, and won't let me reactivate the original application, either.

Learn from my mistake, boys and girls; 1) **Triple** check that your application is how you want it to look. 2) **Don't withdraw your application**, that is your one chance.
