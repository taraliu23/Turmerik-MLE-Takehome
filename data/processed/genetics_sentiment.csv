Have you ever encountered a surprisingly severe genotype in a healthy asymptomatic person?,"Once in awhile I've come across cases that challenge my assumptions about what I think is biologically possible. 

For example, I once had a case with an asymptomatic healthy male in his late 20s who had a homozygous deletion of SMN1. No signs of SMA. It left me scratching my head until I learned that he also had a duplication of SMN2. But even with that duplication, I was very surprised to find out that he was asymptomatic. 

I had another patient with a deletion of SHH and I could only ask myself how this deletion was even compatible with life.

Anyone else come across surprisingly healthy patients?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/mnbjc0/have_you_ever_encountered_a_surprisingly_severe/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9150595664978027

"Free ""What is Genetic Counselling"" Online Couse on FutureLearn with a free Digital Certificate by Wellcome Genome Campus","[FutureLearn](https://www.futurelearn.com/) offers pretty much all courses online for free, but many of them require you to pay to receive a certificate. However, due to the COVID-19 outbreak to promote online learning, there have been multiple free courses that now offer a digital certificate for you that you can download or share on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn.

I took the **What is Genetic Counselling?** course from FutureLearn, and I must say, it was very exciting, very educational and fascinating. There were interactive videos, intriguing articles and cases that helped you see the role of a genetic counsellor and its importance as a profession.

I would recommend anyone interested in genetics and genetic counselling to go for it while it's there. The only requirement for getting a certificate is you should have covered more than 90% of the course and should score higher than 70-75% in the final assessment.

Have a child with a rare genetic diagnosis,"TL;DR - Daughter has a rare genetic variance.  Looking for info / suggestions on the path forward.


Hello - 

I have a daughter who is four months old.  Before she was born, it was discovered that she had a heart defect.  Plans were put in place, she was delivered at full term and had heart surgery two days later.  Since then, everything has gone well from a cardiac standpoint.

While in the cardiac ICU, it was found that she had agenesis of the corpus callosum.  This was a shock to us.  Since there was both a cardiac and neurological issue, genetic testing was recommended.  The first test showed that she had no missing or extra chromosomes.  Next, we had a full genetic sequencing done for my daughter, my wife and myself.  The results showed that my daughter has a rare, de novo (not present in my wife or me) variation of the gene PPP2R1A.  This variation doesn't have a name.  It is not the same thing, but is related to the PPP2R5D variation, sometimes referred to as ""Jordan's syndrome.""  Some of the known traits of individuals with this variation are issues meeting milestones, global delay, hypotonia, severe autistic traits and possible seizures.  However, no one seemed to be able to tell us how severe these issues could be.  Since this situation is so rare, we were essentially told that despite knowing nothing, we are now the experts on this variance in our state.

Since then we have reached out to a few groups for individuals and families affected by similar genetic variances (a very small number that are known worldwide).  We are connecting to a few organizations that are compiling genetic sequencing results to do research and get more answers.  

I'm posting here mainly to find out if anyone has any suggestions of how to find out more, connect with others and provide the best life that we can for our daughter.  I appreciate everyone for taking the time to read this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/eut5la/have_a_child_with_a_rare_genetic_diagnosis/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9171524047851562
I applied to six genetic counseling graduate programs and it cost me almost $5000! How about you?,"Applying to graduate school is  expensive. The cost of the application process can become prohibitively  expensive for many applicants, especially for prospective students from marginalized or disadvantaged backgrounds. Researchers from UC Irvine  want to study the financial barriers that applicants experience when they apply to genetic counseling (GC) programs. If you applied to at least one GC graduate program in the U.S. for admission in Fall 2005\* -  Fall 2020\*, we want to hear from you! Didn't receive an interview or  admission offer/match? Your input matters too! Participation in this study can help us better understand the financial obstacles and uncover  inequities in the application process.

The study involves an anonymous online survey that will take about 15 to 20 minutes.

Participants may enter a raffle for one of 100 Starbucks gift cards ($5 each) at the end of the survey.

YouTube Channel on the History of Genetics?,"Hello r/ClinicalGenetics,

During my time in GC school, we'd randomly hear these dramatic stories about the genetics past. From Darwin to Watson/Crick/Franklin to gene patents and a plethora more.

I think it would be interesting to do a YouTube channel focused on presenting these stories (with supporting evidence) with an animated video. Ideally, I'd develop videos highlighting lesser known facts about genetics or the people who made genetics what it is today in a funny and accurate manner similar to educational YouTubers such as CGP Grey, Tom Scott, & Sam O'Nella.

So I wrote this post to get your opinions. Would you be interested in something like this? Is there a topic you think would make a good video? Am I trying to do something that someone else has already done? Is there someone I should speak with that might have ideas? Am I walking into a legal battle that will financially cripple me?

Genetic Counselor Return on Investment?,"I'm wondering what you all think regarding whether or not a Genetic Counseling degree is ""worth it""?

Since genetic counselors make around $70k a year, I'm wondering if you guys feel your path is worthwhile? Genetic counseling is the first time I've found something that id consider a dream career. I really want to enter the profession, but I don't know if $200k in debt is smart.

23andme raw data to Nebula - scary findings,"Hello all,

I did recently an ancestry+traits 23andme test. All nice and sweet, with fun and benign information, like being 2.6% italian as an otherwise Romanian (Balkan & Greek category) or that I like salty over sweet, no fear of heights etc.

Although I shouldn't have done this, I've uploaded the raw data to nebula, lo and behold, it looks like I'm a huge genetic defect, with most of the conditions being higher than average risk percentiles, with around 85 reports where the percentile of risks exceeds 85, with some (not few) really bad things reaching 98-100 percentile. Some of the conditions I know I have them, some of the conditions I know I'm susceptible to, due to extended family health issues. But some of the are new, including the 100 percentile for mosaic Y chromosome, which byitself increases any risk known to man.

I've asked a geneticist I know (which is not located in Bucharest) if he can recommend me some colleague of his in Bucharest to discuss these result with. He said that he cannot recommend anyone, most geneticists hate these kind of tests and it was not wise for me to check these kind of results.

What do you guys think? Should I disregard the potential findings from Nebula? My approach would be otherwise to do some more investigation for the serious potential issues, some once or two twice a year check-ups to make sure that everything is still ok.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/tljkaj/23andme_raw_data_to_nebula_scary_findings/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9941881895065308
Attempting the ABGC Boards exam for the THIRD time and I need any advice I can get?,"I'm preparing to sign up to take the ABGC Boards exam for the THIRD time and I'm not even sure what to do anymore.

**First attempt, Feb 2021:** Started studying Oct 2020. Was part of 2 weekly study groups, made spreadsheets, powerpoints, taught material on my assigned syndromes to my study partner, took the ABGC practice exam multiple times, did every practice question I could find.  Banned myself in Jan and Feb from everything I like--no podcasts, no books, no movies or tv, not even allowed to have a beer at home. Had to be listening to those review course lectures even if I was cooking or exercising. **Ran out of time on the exam, failed by 15 points, and was under prepared on quantitative questions.**

**Second attempt, August 2021:** Started studying in May, was part of another study group, re enrolled in the boards review course, had a friend tutor me for quant and the trickier metabolic subjects (my weak areas), every night for a month leading up to the exam in addition to studying on my own every night, took more practice tests, read the green book for my weaker psychosocial areas. Was kinder to myself. **Finished with not a moment to spare, nailed my quant questions, failed by 2 points.**

**I'm now gearing up for my 3rd attempt, and have zero motivation to study.** I hate myself, like nothing I've ever hated. I started therapy in September thinking it would help, it hasn't. I have every boards material under the sun now, but I literally have so much I don't feel like I even know how to organize it anymore. I have spent a cumulative $3200 so far, attempting to pass this exam. My job is very intense, so all of my studying must come at night. I made a new study schedule.

Additionally, I haven't been very happy with work for awhile, but it's one of the few roles that will take me without being board certified. I see my friends get all these offers and take new, better paying jobs...but *i don't qualify for any of them because I'm too stupid to pass boards*.

Considering genetic counseling as a career but I have some doubts,"So, I've been doing a lot of research on genetic counseling and it really appeals to me in terms of a career. Just a little background, I received my Bachelor's in Cell and Molecular Biology, with a minor in Psych. I know I don't want to be a doctor, but I don't think I want to make a living working in a lab either. I love teaching and helping others and the field of genetics is super fascinating to me. Everything seems like a perfect fit, however the only thing I am unsure of is the counseling component. I've never been good when it comes to that kind of stuff. When friends or family need advice or help, especially with more sensitive topics, I never know what to say. I'm also a highly emotional person and cry easily, so sensitive topics just aren't really my thing in general. I can't see how I'd ever be able to deal with having to explain to the parents of a child with a fatal genetic disease that they only have a few more months to live. Or to a pregnant woman that her unborn child will suffer a life of sickness or disability. It's heartbreaking. Empathy is definitely my downfall.

Any genetic counselors out there, I'd love to hear your thoughts. How often do you have to give bad news, and how do you deal with it? Is this something they teach you in training? What specialties/areas do you find are more likely to involve giving out bad news, and which ones are generally more reserved in that aspect? What is the nature of the counseling - i.e. how much ""traditional"" counseling is involved? And how much is the counseling aspect a part of your day-to-day activities?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/7s85xi/considering_genetic_counseling_as_a_career_but_i/,ClinicalGenetics,0.9688754677772522

Interested in Medical Genetics Residency,"I have a bachelors in Molecular Genetics and have an M.D. from a Caribbean medical school, and am currently doing an Internal Medicine residency in the USA. I am interested in doing a residency in medical genetics and becoming a clinical geneticist, but I have a few questions. I was wondering if anyone here could give me some information on the field. I was wondering:

&#x200B;

* What do residency programs look for on your application? Research experience? USMLE scores? Previous electives done in medical genetics, LOR from clinical geneticists?
* Do they prefer people with a background in Peds over those with a background in IM, or does that not matter? Should I try to do an elective in Peds?
* As I mentioned, my undergrad was in molecular genetics, and I did a 4th year research project, but that was several years ago. Outside of that, I don't have any research experience in genetics. Will that hurt me?
* Medical genetics residency typically requires 2 years of residency before you can apply. Do you recommend I apply in my second year of IM residency, or should I do an extra year, be a board certified internist, and then apply? What do people typically do?
* What is the job market like for clinical geneticists? Do you typically have to do a fellowship after you finish your medical genetics residency, or can you find a good job after just doing the 2 year residency?
* What is the salary like for Clinical geneticists in the US? How is the life style and work hours?

If you can answer any of these questions, that would be great!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/qy9bwg/interested_in_medical_genetics_residency/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9946479201316833

Genetic counseling or MD?,"Hello! First time poster here on reddit (but long time post-reader!) :)

I am currently a sophomore in college majoring in Biology with a minor in neuroscience, and the past few months I have thought pretty deeply about possible career paths. I am almost certain I will be at a crossroad between genetic counseling or possibly pursuing medical school for maybe psychiatry/pediatrics. Right now, I have been thinking a lot about the cost of medical school and whether or not it is worth the extra years, stress, etc.

Just a bit of background, I have worked for the Crisis Text Line this past year and have absolutely LOVED the opportunity to help individuals on the platform. I haven't had the chance to shadow any physicians or genetic counselors due to covid, but I feel like that would be extremely beneficial to see the ins-and-outs of their daily lives and their careers. In the future, work-life balance is critical to me. I love art, traveling, and eventually want to have a family, and my career is always going to be something I work hard towards. I 100% know that I want to work directly with the public/with families, and the ability to teach/counsel, and possibly travel to other countries to develop health programs and initiatives is something that really excites me!

So, what are some of your stories/paths to either genetic counseling or an MD? Or perhaps choosing between the two? Does being a GC involved a lot of clerical tasks?

Research Study: Genetic Cancer Risk & Family Building Conversations with Partners [Mod Approved],"Hello,

This post has been approved by the moderators of this subreddit! 

The Cancer Communication Research Lab at the University of South Florida is looking for participants and their partners to participate in a research study. The purpose of the study is to develop a list of questions and prompts that patients and partners can use in their conversations and ultimately help them communicate their priorities and values about family building.

To be eligible to participate in this study, you must meet the following criteria. You:

(1) are between the ages of 18 to 39 years old;

(2) have received positive genetic test results that predispose you to cancer (e.g., Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer, Lynch, Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, Cowdens, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, Li-Fraumeni);

(3) have a partner who is also willing to participate in the study and are currently cohabitating with that partner;

(4) have not completed your family building (i.e., either through biological means, adoption, or surrogacy); and

(5) are currently living in the United States.

By participating in this research study, you will each be compensated up to $180 if you complete all phases of the study.

If you are interested in participating, please contact the Study Coordinator Jonathan Baker at [cancercomm@usf.edu](mailto:cancercomm@usf.edu) for further information.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/fjv975/research_study_genetic_cancer_risk_family/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9688847661018372

Geneticists of Reddit: Need Job-Hunting Advice,"Need job hunting advice from geneticists and others employed in science fields.

The situation: My wife (38) has a bachelor's degree in genetics from UC Davis. She graduated about 15 years ago. Her goal was to get a masters degree in genetic counseling, but that plan has been delayed for the time being due to finances.

The main reason for the gap is that she has Cystic Fibrosis and became very sick after she finished school. She has since had a lung transplant but is having a hard time finding jobs in the science world.

We're not sure where she can look to find a job in her field of study. She went to a UC Davis career fair and their advice was basically to just get into a masters program as soon as possible, but we can't afford it right now. Once she's able to find work, we can begin to save up for her masters, but she really prefers to find work in the science world if possible.

Any and all advice is appreciate.

To those who do counseling on PGS results of embryos - I am genuinely curious how this became an absolute and a diagnostic test when there are 0 positive predictive value studies which makes it at best a screening test?,"Hi there, 

I am genuinely curious to hear from those that practice in clinical genetics on reproductive side and those who counsel patients on PGS/PGT screening results of their embryos. 

I am sure you all understand that a positive test result isn't diagnostic here aka when someone gets an  ""aneuploid"" result, yet everyone jumped on this wagon and refused to transfer those embryos? How did this even happen? 

As you all know placental mosaicism is extremely common (let's say around 2%), but we are also dealing with an infertile population during IVF (which I assume would be more prone to having chromosomal issues such as mosaicism and chromosome non disjunction anyway). So if even the NIPT test is not a diagnostic test which is also essentially testing the cytotrophoblast layer (which comes from PGS biopsy trophectoderm), how the hell did PGS become what it is today? NIPT which essentially does a liquid biopsy of the same exact layer is also based on the age and the prevalence, so why are PGS results not given the same treatment? It applies in the same way. What is a positive predictive value of the fact that ""your baby will be born with birth defects"" from these micro-deletion Aneuploid embryos when PPV for the several micro deletions on NIPT is about 2-10% at best? NIPT PPV of trisomy 7 is about 1% of less seeing how that’s the most common false positive on expanded NIPT screen which is horrible to order since the PPV of rare autosomal trisomies just is close to 0-1% since prevalence is extremely low. So again... when you see PGS +7, how can you possibly tell a patient that embryo will absolutely miscarry or absolutely end in birth defects when PPV of PGS for that be closer to the NIPT PPV of 0? 

I hear all the time how patients get counseling and that ""the embryo will not survive or end up in birth defects"" when there is a random aneuploidy detected such as lets say monosomy 2. Why would a clinical geneticist tell any patient with any certainty that this is the case when there is NO positive predictive value to PGS? AKA there is no study that has transferred these embryos and can define that yes, there was a baby born with defects etc. 

The first two studies addressing positive predictive value of PGS are these two that I am aware of, and results likely won't be out for another 2 years.  So, how did this happen? Do any of you counsel the patient with the preface that PGS is a SCREENING at best? Do you tell people there is no positive predictive value? With the known fact that ""mosaic"" embryos result in healthy pregnancies, there has not been any data except the few anecdotal stories on Facebook about the ""brave""  women who transfer fully aneuploid embryos who had normal babies. There are many studies of ""concordance"" of ICM/TE biopsies but that is still not a PPV of PGS what so ever, and the results are variable depending on what study you look at. 

These are the 2 studies that will address the PPV of PGS, that are pending. So.... how did this happen? And why are patients being told these things with certainty in the CG community?

"Late 20's Male trying to make a career change and get into a Genetic Counseling M.S., if you guys don't mind looking over my stats and helping me figure out my chances I would really appreciate it!","Hey everyone, so I know you probably don't like these kind of threads but I recently finished up my applications and I'm really stressing out, just wanted to get some thoughts on what people thought my chances are.

I have an undergraduate B.A. from the University Of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a poor G.P.A. (3.2) and no science classes. I had a lot of family/personal issues in my 20's and basically wasted this whole decade floating around never truly knowing what I wanted to do. Due to my family issues I realized that what I was most passionate about was people and improving people's lives so I decided to look towards health fields, either nursing or GC. After researching both, so many RN's seemed to complain endlessly about their jobs so I decide to try going for GC, especially since it seems like it opens up more future options, although so does nursing. 

The last two years I went back to a community college to take as many science classes as possible in preparation for applying, these were my grades:

* B in Biology 1, A in Biology 2
* B in Chemistry 1, A in Chemistry 2
* A in Microbiology
* A in both Anatomy 1 and 2
* A in Organic Chemistry 1
* A in Biochemistry
* A in Introduction to Human Genetics
* A in Introduction to Psychology and Abnormal Psychology
* Also an A in a graduate level Statistics course that I took in Certificate Program for programming at another University

- I got my shit together and became a better student, I have about 45 credits from the CC, and my Science GPA is like 3.85 or something along those lines. 

* GRE: 166 Qual, 165 Quant, so I did okay on the GRE.

* I've got around 50 hours of shadowing a pediatric genetic counselor and around 350 advocacy hours at various volunteer organizations, including crisis counseling.

I'm worried that my really bad undergraduate career will count against me. I was a really shitty student and person, and always did the minimum, so I have no research experience, or connections to professors. I'm also worried about the fact that all Science courses are from a community college and not a four year University, and that I only took one Genetics course, since that's all my CC offered and it isn't an advanced course, just an intro. My dream programs are either University of Wisconsin Madison or University of Minnesota, and I know how competitive and good both those schools are and how competitive GC is in general. Thanks to anyone reading and would appreciate any an all help or comments!

International US genetic counselors,"I'm from the UK, and I've been trying to contact ABGC to see if I could get ABGC certified with a British MSc in genetic counselling. I haven't received a definitive answer - it seems no one knows!

The main criteria is to have a degree from an AGCG certified university, which doesn't exist outside the US.

&#x200B;

So my questions to this forum are:

1) do you have any international genetic counsellor colleagues?

2) If so, which country did they get their MSc from?

3) Do you know how they got ABGC certified?

Chances of getting into genetic counseling programs?,"Hi everyone! I just submitted my application for the 2019 admissions cycle, and I am feeling very unsure about my chances of even getting interviews, let alone actually getting into any of these programs. I thought it might help to share my application with you and see what you think. 

* I am graduating in spring 2019 with a BS in biology and a minor in psychology
* GPA: 3.14 with upward trend (GPA for junior and senior year is 3.66) 
   * I did fairly well in all of my psychology, genetics, and biology pre-recs (As or Bs) 
   * I did not do so well in general chemistry, organic chemistry, or statistics (Cs) 
   * I'm taking Biochemistry this spring 
* GRE: 89th percentile for verbal; 39th percentile for quantitative.
* I have worked on two separate research projects. My 'big' project involved using a GFP reporter plasmid to investigate the activity of promoters in O cluster bacteriophages. I worked on this project for one summer for 40 hours a week, and I presented my findings at multiple conferences. Also, my research mentor wrote a letter of recommendation for me. 
* My other research project involved using rtPCR and qPCR to investigate the transcription of a bacillithiol transferase gene in Basillus Subtilis when under stress from antibiotics. I worked on this project for one semester for about 3-6 hours a week. 
*  I interned at a genetics laboratory for one semester.  
* I have worked as a prep lab technician for the chemistry department at my university for three (going on four) years. 
* I have shadowed genetic counselors in prenatal (one interview and one full day shadowing), cancer (one full day), and pediatrics (several weeks). The genetic counselor I shadowed in pediatrics wrote a letter of recommendation for me.
* I have been a crisis counselor with the crisis text line for about six months (I've logged around 70 hours)
* I volunteered at my local museum in the natural sciences wing for around four years (all through high school, I included it because I mentioned it in my personal statement)
* I volunteered in the Science in Action program at my college for one semester (science majors visit local elementary schools to teach hour-long classes and lead experiments designed to teach scientific thinking) 
* I'm an active member of a social justice club at my university, and I have done various kinds of volunteer work with them 

Thank you for going over my application, sorry it's kinda long!

Family planning with being a genetic carrier of SMA,"This is more a question aimed at both parents who carry the SMA Type 1 gene or any gene where there's a 25% chance their baby in utero could inherit a disease. In late 2019 I fell pregnant with my darling baby boy.  Everything was going well, until I took the NIPT test and discovered I was a carrier for SMA Type 1.  My doctor told me not to be alarmed, and that my husband would have to be tested as a precaution but the likelihood of him also carrying the gene was slim. Well, he did test positive as a carrier.  

I decided to get an amniocentesis done (I was 20 weeks pregnant at this point, a huge oversight by the doctor's office and genetic counselor who failed to inform me earlier that my husband also tested positive -- but that's a story for another time).

Anyway the waiting period to find out whether my baby would have SMA Type1 or not was probably one of the most, if not the most, anxiety inducing experiences of my life.  Fortunately, he was of the 25% of those that do not even carry the gene, and is a healthy lively bouncy baby today.

My question is for those parents who have the gene and want to grow their families: How did you decide to go about having more children after you gained the knowledge that you and your partner are both carriers of SMA (or other genetic diseases that you could potentially pass on)?  In Vitro? Naturally? Did you decide to not try for anymore due to the risk? Why?

I feel like I have so much soul searching to do - while I would love to grow my brood, is it irresponsible of me to go the natural route and try for another, knowing I could potentially have the outcome of SMA Type 1? Should I go with in vitro - despite the cost - and test the embryos to make sure they're healthy, but go into debt to do so? (Insurance would never cover this). Should I just forgo having another, and make peace with having only one? 

These are my thoughts - and wondering what other parents with the gene have decided for themselves when it comes to family planning, if they're willing to share?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/mzslgx/family_planning_with_being_a_genetic_carrier_of/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9921736717224121

Genetic Counseling Entry Compensation?,"Hello!

Currently an undergrad biology student considering genetic counseling! I am technically on a pre-med track, but right now I am exploring all of my options (and I absolutely love genetics :)).

Right now I live in Pennsylvania, but after college I have my heart set on moving to a warmer state like Florida or California (and potentially attending grad school there as well). Since living in CA is associated with some pretty high costs of living, I am curious to see what is the typical entry level salary in an area like that. After graduating GC school, what are some of the highest paying areas within the field? Is it rare that a recent graduate can take immediately a leadership role within a hospital, clinic, or research company? 

Thanks so much for any input/help!

"Single mother by choice, carrier of two conditions. Opinions appreciated.","Hello all, This is a throwaway account due to the personal information disclosed. Thank you in advance for your time and help. 

I am about to begin IVF as a single mother by choice, and during carrier screening I was identified as being a carrier of two conditions. One of them is Retinitis Pigmentosa EYS, which is not a surprise given that it has made its presence strongly known in my maternal line multiple times. The second, GJB2 (M34T missense) was a surprise. The concern is that I had been saving up for IVF for quite some time and had purchased sperm vials at the beginning of this process. The vials are from a donor which I really liked, and having faced adversity at every turn in this process, changing donors, especially one that I had for so long thought would be the father, feels like the straw that may the camel's back. In any case, this individual had screening for spinal muscular atrophy and cystic fibrosis and was negative, but he did not have extended screening. Unfortunatley, the donor declined further testing when contacted by the bank. The main question that I have now is about how severe the specific mutation of M34T is given that it is the more prevalent condition. I was told by the genetic counselor even when paired with another GJB2 variation, M3RT tends to be expressed as milder hearing loss. In looking through academic articles, I think I have found consistent suppprt for this, but I'd appreciate more information on how it interacts with other variants. 

Could you please advise on both the general situation, as well as the severity of possible outcomes of  M34T in combination with itself or other mutations? For reference, the donor is Southwest-Asian/Central Asian. Please be assured that I have already sought counseling, so I am just seeking an informal, but hopefully more specific set of opinions. If you could kindly include any relevant academic articles, I'd appreciate it.

In-laws wish to include genetic screening for spouses of descendants in trust,"My very traditional, Confucian in-laws wish to include a clause in their trust requiring any descendants receiving disbursements to subject potential spouses to genetic screening. Anyone who tests positive for a variety of selected genetic conditions (e.g. Huntington's, Cystic Fibrosis, etc.) would not be eligible for inclusion in the disbursements.

Currently, my two sons are the only heirs, so it would only affect my children and their future spouses.

I am trying to assemble a list of reasons why this is an epically horrible idea. Here's what I have so far. I would appreciate any suggestions from the experts here to add or amend this list:

\- Practical considerations... At what point in a relationship does one spring upon a suitor that they need to be screened? Right when dating starts? After a relationship becomes serious? After a proposal?

\- It's impossible to assemble a selection of genetic conditions. Which conditions should be on the list? Which shouldn't? Combing through all severe genetic conditions would take forever -- and with the chance of a spontaneous mutation, it could be pointless, anyway.

\- Ethics. I don't even know where to begin on this one, because emotions get in the way of thought here. But maybe someone could help articulating the massive ethical pitfalls in meddling in the genetic futures of descendants.

\- Those who are genetic carriers can screen for them (if they choose to) using PGD.

\- Anything else?

In my in-laws' defense... They are elderly and operate a lot on fear, based on the instability growing up in war-torn countries. They have worked their whole lives to recover the resources lost when their family fled China. And these are medical topics they don't understand well at all. Hopefully informing them in a compassionate way will make it clear that they should not do this. But to do that, I need the words to say to them. Perhaps there are some here who can help.

Exploring the Options of Genetic Counsellor,"Hi, I'm a first-year student in Canada and I was hoping to get some help from current genetic counsellors as I'm interested in pursuing the career. I originally wanted to be a doctor but I want to explore other careers in life science and I feel like this job would be a good fit for me as it allows me to blend science and helping others directly.

First how important is GPA in admissions. I'm currently holding a 4.0 but I don't know how that will translate to future years. It seems most schools in Canada want a B average. is GPA a big component or is it just something that you need to make the cutoff for.

I'm currently working as a tutor for my part-time job and I've volunteered in a hospital last summer (planning on doing it again this summer). I've applied to some crisis hotlines to get counselling experience and hope to get a position where I will try to stay for a couple of years. I also plan on contacting genetic counsellors in the future to volunteer/shadow. 

There are only 3 schools in Canada and the two that I could find stats on (Manitoba and BC) are pretty low. So, therefore, I will probably have to take the GRE and apply to American schools.

I guess I'm just wondering what are my chances of becoming a genetic counsellor. I've been trying to find careers in life science I would like and I finally found one but I'm worried I may not be able to make it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/fffiuk/exploring_the_options_of_genetic_counsellor/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9972299933433533

Considering Genetic Counseling,"Hello all,

I am a senior who is considering majoring in genetics and possibly going on to become a genetic counselor. However, I have some questions about the field.

1. Ethically, I am pro-life. Would this be an issue going into GC work? Do I have other options besides prenatal work?
2. Are graduate programs hard to get into coming from undergrad?
3. What is the worst and best thing about your job?
4. Are there any jobs similar to GC work that I should know about?

GC Programs that won't accept lower GPAs?,"I know every applicant's situation is unique, but are there any schools anyone has had experiences with that won't accept lower-range GPAs (closer to 3.0 than 3.5)? I know the GPA is just one factor of many that programs are looking for, but I'm trying to give myself the best chance at getting accepted.

I was reading a thread earlier where a couple of posters mentioned that they were told the University of Colorado Denver does not give interviews for students with lower than 3.4 GPAs. Mine is on the lower end, and I'd like to save some money/time not applying to schools if I already know I won't get an interview.

Again, I know there are a range of factors that go in to selections including GPA, such as GRE scores, experience, advocacy work, etc. Just wondering if anyone else has any insight/feedback.

Incidental findings of consanguinity,"SNP microarrays can detect regions of homozygosity within the genome and incidental evidence of consanguinity in individuals with closely related parents.1 Furthermore, the level of homozygosity within the genome can determine the degree of relatedness between parents (e.g. double first cousins, first cousins, second cousins).2 Prior genotyping techniques, like karyotyping and comparative genomic hybridization, were not able to identify consanguinity, so this is a relatively new ethical challenge. The purpose of this post is to provide guidance to laboratory personnel, genetic counselors, clinicians, and others who may be involved with genetic testing processes.

**Informed consent**

The informed consent process should include a discussion about the risks and implications of detecting consanguinity and provide an opportunity for patients to ask questions. An awareness of cultural or social issues that may influence a patient’s choice to consent to genetic testing can help guide these conversations.

Consensual consanguinity: It is estimated that over 20% of the human population lives in communities with a preference for consanguineous marriage.3 The practice is customary in the Middle East, parts of South Asia, some Jewish communities, and tribes throughout sub-Saharan African and South East Asia.5 Individuals may be uncomfortable discussing consanguinity with those outside the community, or fear that they will be stigmatized.3

Non-consensual consanguinity: Genetic testing may reveal evidence of incestual rape and, due to potential personal and social implications of such information, an understanding of this possibility is important.6

**Privacy**

The Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA) prevents discrimination based on genetic information by health insurers and employers, but does not protect individuals from stigmatization within their communities if details about consanguinity become publicly known.6,7 Laboratory reports and patient chart notes should be limited to information that is medically relevant, described in technical terms, and avoid mentioning specific people or relationships. 

A good example of appropriate language has been published by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics: “Several large regions of homozygosity (x Mb or larger) were detected, encompassing >y% of the genome. Although this result is not diagnostic of a specific condition, it raises the possibility of a recessive disorder with a causative gene located within one of these regions. A genetics consultation is recommended.” In cases where a medically relevant first- or second-degree parental relationship is suspected, it may be appropriate to add the following information, “these results could indicate a familial relationship (first or second degree) between this individual’s parents.”8

**Legal Responsibilities**

Intrafamilial sexual abuse should be considered in pregnant minor teenagers, or incompetent adults, and evidence suggesting incest should be reported. Healthcare providers are not required to report incestuous rape if the victim is a competent adult and does not want it reported.9

In the United States, specific guidelines for reporting incest and/or rape can be found at https://www.rainn.org/public-policy-action

**Have you come across incidental findings of consanguinity in your work setting? If so, how did you/your institution handle the situation?**

Genetic Counseling Career Questions,"Hello,

This is my first post on this subreddit. I've always had a fascination for psychology and genetics and I'm thinking of becoming a genetic counselor down the line.  However, I want to make sure that the field is a good fit for me before I take the plunge. Are there any professionals out there that can help answer some questions? Thanks.

1. As fascinating as I find the field to be, I'm worried that my ability to interact with people and handle their emotions might be my downfall. I can socialize with strangers quite well, but I'm not sure how to compose myself if a patient sitting across from me starts to rage or cry from receiving bad news. Is it common to deliver bad news in this field?
2. If working directly with patients simply isn't a good fit for me, are there any other positions within the realm of genetic counselling that I can do? Are these positions hard to get?
3. How do I know if my interest in genes and human behavior is enough to sustain a career in this field? How might I put this interest to the test?
4. One fear I have is that of not being smart enough to be accepted into a masters program and thus winding up with a four-year undergraduate degree that doesn't offer much in terms of employment. Has anyone encountered this situation? What else can one do with just a degree in human genetics?
5. Is shift work common in this field? I understand most genetic counselors work in a hospital/clinical setting, yet I long for regular 9 am -5pm hours.
6. What is the common Meyers-Briggs personality type for those working in this field? I'm an INTJ myself and wonder if there are others like me.

Microarray Results : Loss at 2q13,"Hi all. Currently 20 weeks pregnant, just got results from my amniocentesis. These were the results that I was given and I’m wondering if anybody has received results similar to this and can give some insight. I did meet with the genetic counselor but was given very short answers to my questions. Can somebody please help !! 

	3.	Test Results: The test found something unusual:
	•	There’s a small loss of genetic material (862 kilobases, a unit of measurement in genetics) in a specific region of the genome called 2q13. This missing piece includes three important genes.
	•	The loss is called “potentially pathogenic,” meaning it could be linked to health problems.
	4.	Interpretation:
	•	The missing piece affects genes that are known to be involved in certain diseases (like Joubert syndrome and nephronophthisis). These conditions can affect things like the brain, kidneys, and overall development.
	•	The report suggests genetic counseling (talking to a specialist about what the findings mean) and further testing to figure out if this loss is inherited or happened spontaneously in the baby.

At what point should I be worried about inbreeding? (And is there a test for it?),"I'm from India and culturally there is a practice among certain communities where children are frequently married to their cousins and uncles. I remember my mum talking about this quite casually when I was young but avoids the subject at all costs these days.

I'm not particularly close to her side of the family, but from our limited interactions I would not be surprised at all if this was a practice they follow. My sister got married this month and I met one of our cousins for the first time in years. He introduced me to his wife's family and I was shocked by the obvious family resemblances that they all share.

I know that this isn't quite ""The hills have eyes"" because we're essentially physically healthy, but I have noticed that there are far more psychiatric issues on my mum's side. My other cousin has serious developmental issues and multiple diagnoses and can barely function. My sister and I have struggled with anxiety. depression and mild ADHD all our lives. The adults don't exactly ""believe"" in mental health but their symptoms are obvious to me at least - the most obvious is my uncle who hasn't left the house in years, but even the least symptomatic of them have gotten REALLY slow with time. 

I'm moving to Canada soon and one of the things that I really want to do is take advantage of the better tools in healthcare available there. My primary focus would be therapy and ADHD meds, but I really am curious about whether there is any specific genetic test for this. (Ideally some sort of % of inbreeding kind of thing?) Does anyone have any suggestions on how I might approach this? 

Asking my family members to get themselves proper diagnoses isn't possible - both because of their repeated refusals, and the poor state of psychiatric services in India.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/1cma387/at_what_point_should_i_be_worried_about/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9943662881851196

Alternative pathway to becoming a variant scientist?,"Hi all! I have a Bachelor's in Cell & Molecular Bio and was originally planning on getting my Master's in Genetic Counseling, but I ultimately realized it wasn't quite a good fit for me. However, the variant curation aspect/role really stood out to me and I think is something I would enjoy a lot. I know you generally need a PhD or MD for this role - either that or a Genetic Counseling Master's. But would something like this [certificate program](https://www.uab.edu/shp/cds/industry-genetics-and-genomics-certificate) from UAB perhaps allow me to enter into the field from an alternative pathway? Would I be able to obtain a job as a variant curator/scientist just with this? The other options would require a much greater commitment in terms of time, money, etc than I currently have at the moment. But if I know this specific area is what I want to get into, would something like the certificate program be a feasible direct pathway towards it? When it comes to actually obtaining a job, would it be too competitive since I'd be competing with others who have more advanced degrees? Or would not matter as much since it's a program tailored specifically to the job? Any thoughts on this would be much appreciated!

I would also like to get y'all's opinions on the outlook for this career in general - is this something that is at risk of eventually becoming obsolete/being taken over by AI?

"Baby’s femur and humerus are 1% or less at 33, and 39 weeks - what are the chances we are looking at hetero achondroplasia?","Update: just gave birth via c section and he is actually ok! He looked totally normal and pedi came to check him out and said bones didn’t look short and looked proportional and no signs of achon. I’m super relieved and decided not to do any further testing and to enjoy the cuddles. So happy right now and feel like I won the lottery. 

——- 


I am very sad and really distraught about these as it was first noted at 32 weeks that 
BPD 70% HC 65% 
FL 10%
(At anatomy scan everything was 50%)

At 34 weeks 
BPD 60% HC 60% AC 40%
FL 1.5%

Remeasure at MFM at 35 weeks 
BPD 80%
AC 25%
FL 5%
HL 5%


Remeasure at 39 weeks at MFM
FL less than 1% corresponding to 34 weeks 
HL 3% 

So 5 weeks behind on long bones 
Tib fib 40%, no frontal bossing noted, I asked about bowing he said he didn’t see any. They didn’t tell me anything else and said it could be nothing or achondroplasia. 

Do you always see frontal bossing? Have you seen this be nothing? What’s the thought of leading cause for short long bones?

I am giving birth by c section in 3 days and I am terrified. My other 2 kids had normal measurements prenatally. We are both tall. No family history but I know this is a problem in spermatogenesis of older males if Hetero and my husband is 50. 

Also I read this paper saying 50% of the time it was, and another that about 8% will have a pathalogic CNV associated.  (https://d197for5662m48.cloudfront.net/documents/publicationstatus/31044/preprint_pdf/bb7437b54ec5ab4bed5b364698607fe7.pdf)

At birth, do all achon kids have the trident hand, can you tell by looking? Do I ask for a skeletal survey to be done the day he’s born? Who do I ask to see him at the hospital?

Experiences with Screening and Surgery for Gynecological Cancer in People with Lynch Syndrome - Anonymous Survey,"My name is Ryan Mahoney and I am a genetic counseling graduate student at the University of California, Irvine. Since starting my training as a genetic counselor, I have had the privilege to be involved with many local cancer clinics; being able to work with individuals and their families at such vulnerable times in their lives has truly been a gift, so I wanted to dedicate my graduate thesis work towards furthering knowledge about the experiences of people living with Lynch syndrome.

There is currently some debate between gynecologists and people with Lynch syndrome about whether they should receive things like endometrial biopsies, pelvic ultrasounds, and other screening tests as options to help reduce the amount of endometrial and ovarian cancer seen in people with Lynch syndrome. Some gynecologists believe there is a lack of compelling data to prove that there is a benefit to this screening while the patients report feeling more secure in their health management plans by receiving regular gynecological screening. The results of this research may help medical practitioners better understand what factors might influence people with Lynch syndrome to make medical decisions about their gynecological healthcare. I am hoping that the information gained from this survey will help medical practitioners in the future be more aware about the wants, needs, and decision making strategies used by people with Lynch syndrome to preserve their overall health and wellbeing.

Eligible participants must be 18 years or older who have been confirmed to have Lynch syndrome and either currently have or have previously had a uterus and ovaries.

"Association, Syndrome or Disorder?","What is the actual usage of these terms in clinical genetics? The Wikipedia page on Syndrome has a section on medical genetics which suggests the usage is almost the opposite than in some other fields - rather than syndrome meaning a collection of signs and symptoms that seem to co-occur but you don't really know the mechanism, in medical genetics you call it a syndrome precisely when the genetic cause has been established? But then why when they discovered Trisomy 21 and the Lancet in 1961 agreed to rename the condition Down's Syndrome, did the editor say only until the genetic causes were better established then it can be renamed? 

Why does this medical informatics article ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1480257/ ) say that it's only called a syndrome when you don't know the underlying mechanism? Is this simply about a distinction between the genetics and the intermediary mechanisms that result in signs and symptoms? 


Why are psych conditions apparently called syndromes in some countries but disorders in others? Why are they never called 'associations' even though mostly neither the mechanisms nor the genetics are determined?

Cri du Chat Diagnosis,"My 5 month old daughter was just diagnosed with Cri du Chat. She has an unblanaced translocation of the 5p chromosome (22.37 MB terminal deletion of 5pter->5p14.3) and chromosome 3 (3.27 MB terminal duplication of 3PTER->3P26.3). According to the paperwork provided by the lab, the most proximal duplicated gene on 3p is CRBN and the most proximal deleted gene is PMCHL1. She was born with a cleft lip (no palate involvment) but does not have any dysmorphic features other than very mild epicanthal folds.

Can someone help translate all this for me and help me better understand what genes might be affected and their function?

We can't meet with genetics until the middle of October.

Also, be blunt, I am very aware of how serious the syndrome can be, but the abstract of not knowing anything right now is driving me crazy. Anecdotally, families on the cri du chat support group argue against the idea that a larger deletion would cause more severe problems.

Genetic Counseling as a Second Career,"Hi All!

I graduated with a Supply Chain (business) degree in 2011. I currently work for a start up in NYC. I love my company, but not my job, and I've been considering a switch for some time. 

I was diagnosed with breast cancer six months ago at age 28. (I caught it early.. I'm doing okay!) I met with a genetic counselor following my diagnosis and really connected with her. That meeting opened my eyes to what genetic counseling was. I've been researching like crazy since then and find the field fascinating. I love that this career is rooted in science and data but also has a very human component (something I miss in my current job). I wish I had known about this career ten years ago!

Do you think it's possible to make the switch? If so, any advice? Additionally, I would have to take pre reqs here in NYC, do GC programs put a lot of weight into the caliber of school those pre reqs come from?

"When DNA means ""do not ask"": As comprehensive genetic tests become more widespread, patients and experts mull how to deal with unexpected findings [from Scientific American]","**The Science of Health**

Last spring Laura Murphy, then 28 years old, went to a doctor to find out if a harmless flap of skin she had always had on the back of her neck was caused by a genetic mutation. Once upon a time, maybe five years ago, physicians would have focused on just that one question. But today doctors tend to run tests that pick up mutations underlying a range of hereditary conditions. Murphy learned not only that a genetic defect was indeed responsible for the flap but also that she had another inherited genetic mutation.

This one predisposed her to long QT syndrome, a condition that dramatically increases the risk of sudden cardiac death. In people with the syndrome, anything that startles them -- say, a scary movie or an alarm clock waking them from a deep slumber -- might kill by causing the heart to beat completely erratically.

Doctors call this second, unexpected result an ""incidental finding"" because it emerged during a test primarily meant to look for something else. The finding was not accidental, because the laboratory was scouring certain genes for abnormalities, but it was unexpected.

Murphy, whose name was changed for this story, will most likely have plenty of company very soon. The growing use of comprehensive genetic tests in clinics and hospitals practically guarantees an increasing number of incidental discoveries in coming years. Meanwhile the technical ability to find these mutations has rapidly outpaced scientists' understanding of how doctors and patients should respond to the surprise results.

**UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS**

Incidental findings from various medical tests have long bedeviled physicians and their patients. They appear in about a third of all CT scans, for example. A scan of the heart might reveal odd shadows in nearby lung tissue. Further investigation of the unexpected results -- either through exploratory surgery or yet more tests -- carries its own risks, not to mention triggering intense anxiety in the patient. Follow-up exams many times reveal that the shadow reflects nothing at all -- just normal variation with no health consequences.

What makes incidental findings from genetic tests different, however, is their even greater level of uncertainty. Geneticists still do not know enough about how most mutations in the human genome affect the body to reliably recommend any treatments or other actions based simply on their existence. Furthermore, even if the potential effects are known, the mutation may require some input from the environment before it will cause its bad effects. Thus, the presence of the gene does not necessarily mean that it will do damage. Genetics is not destiny. In Murphy's case, her mutation means that she has a roughly 50 to 80 percent chance of developing long QT syndrome, and the presence of the mutation alone is not a sure indicator she will be afflicted, says her physician, Jim Evans, a genetics and medicine professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. To be safe, he has advised her to meet with a cardiac specialist to talk about next steps, including possibly starting beta-blocker drugs to regularize her heart rate.

The incidence of hard-to-interpret results is expected to rise because the cost of surveying large swaths of the genome has dropped so low -- to around $1,000. It is typically less expensive to get preselected information about the 20,000 or so genes that make up a person's exome -- the section of the genome that provides instructions for making proteins -- than to perform a more precision-oriented test that targets a single gene. As a consequence, scientists and policy makers are now scrambling to set up guidelines for how much information from such testing to share with patients and for how best to help them deal with the inevitable incidental findings.

Before making any definitive recommendations, however, they need to know how often genetic results produce such findings. To that end, Evans is heading up the NCGENES clinical trial, part of a larger effort by three organizations, including the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. Of the roughly 300 patients who have received genetic information since Evans started ordering whole exome tests a couple of years ago, he says, six of them (or 2 percent) had incidental findings that required further testing or decisions about treatment.

Separately, Christine Eng, medical director of the DNA Diagnostic Laboratory at the Baylor College of Medicine, says her team has conducted more than 2,000 whole exome tests since October 2011 with about 95 incidental findings. ""That's an incidence of about 5 percent,"" she notes. Most of the findings did not require immediate action. Usually they prompt more frequent screening tests, often for breast cancer or colorectal cancer.

**BALANCING ACT**

In the hope of minimizing the number of people forced to cope with incidental findings, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) in 2013 proposed regularly returning results on 56 genes from comprehensive genetic tests. The professional group felt that there was enough -- though by no means conclusive -- information about these specific mutations to merit letting patients know if they had tested positive for them. In other words, the mutations ""met a standard of relatively high likelihood of being disease-causing."" The list included genetic variants that have been strongly linked to retinoblastoma (cancer of the eye), hereditary breast cancer and long QT syndrome. The ACMG believed that its guidance would give physicians a shortcut so they would not need to haphazardly guess which mutations had a strong enough link to a given malady to tell patients about the results.

Such advice is particularly important given how often children undergo genetic tests nowadays. ""About 80 percent of our cases are pediatric-aged, so the incidental findings are being found in the children, and many of the conditions are adult-onset conditions,"" Eng says. Families given such information about their children then may have to wait decades before they can do anything about it or decide when, if ever, to start considering treatment for a disorder that may not ever develop.

Yet a year after issuing its guidance, the ACMG produced an addendum: patients should have the opportunity to opt out of having information about even that short list of analyzed genes. ""When families are given a choice, a very large percentage of them want this information, but there are some individuals who feel they do not want this information, so I think this option is a good one,"" says Eng, who was not on that decision-making board.

For her part, Murphy is still grappling with how to respond to her incidental finding. She is not yet 30, and she finds it hard to imagine being young and carefree and on beta blockers. ""Generally, I'm a very healthy person. I was doing just fine until now, so why does it matter that I found this out?"" she asks. ""I've been giving it a lot of thought, and if I hadn't gotten [the test] done, I might never have known about this. Now I'm wondering if I really want a lifestyle change. It's a lot to think about."" Yet the hope is that Murphy's experience, and those of other patients, will help geneticists decide which tests to include in future gene scans and better prepare patients and health care workers for dealing with any unwelcome surprises.

Finding out sons genetic condition - and Why ROH?,"

Hi guys, I have been trying to use chatgpt for a while now and I think I understand most things but now I am at a stage where I think chatgpt might hallucinate a bit.

So story is: Me (Scandinavian) and my fiancée (polish) got a son a year ago - our son already during pregnancy showed ROH on chromosome 4 and eventually after WES they found a super rare mutation in homozygous state in the same area ROH is.

Now for me this should be due to UPD as I cannot see it possible that I share ancestor with my fiancée. But our geneticist of course suggested it. 5+ generations back she hinted.

now we have my result back (ngs sanger) that I do NOT have the detected variant. (Buccal swab)

We did a myheritage test and downloaded raw data - but on the website we do not show as a match, and looking through on chromosome 4 snps yeah for sure we share some similar alleles on these snps but not entirely and one place we have TT on my side and GG on hers. So the ROH must have happened due to UPD? Or am I missing something?

As I see it this is not a medical question, it is a genetics question on how to arrive to the conclusion on whether UPD occurred or not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/1efataf/finding_out_sons_genetic_condition_and_why_roh/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9988183379173279

Should I take a gap year before applying to genetic counseling programs?,"Hi,

I'm currently a senior majoring in Environmental Biology and minoring in Psychology (3.9 GPA). I found out about genetic counseling a bit late in my undergrad time so I've really spent the last two years tailoring my course work around hitting prerequisites and coursework that programs recommend. 

As far as extracurriculars, I've been volunteering with Crisis Text Line for about 10 months and also volunteering as a job coach for formerly incarcerated individuals for about 4 months. I've also worked in an ecology lab for over 2 years doing mostly molecular work in plant genetics - decent wet bench experience I think (have a poster presentation from my lab work as well), but I stopped working there this semester. I've also been on the varsity soccer team at my university for 4 years which has definitely limited the amount of free time I have been able to devote to volunteering, but I've been doing my best. 

In the spring, I'm planning on volunteering at a center helping people recover from substance abuse and starting a part-time job at a clinical genetics lab helping to interpret chromosome microarray results. 

I think my weakest area is exposure to the field. I've done 3 informational interviews so far (only one with an actual genetic counselors, the other two were with PhD's who work at a cytogenetics and molecular pathology lab at my city hospital). My focus if I do take a gap year will be almost entirely on exposure/shadowing experience, while continuing my volunteer work. 

Another worry of mine is that I've never taking a human physiology class - which some programs recommend. 

Sorry for writing so much, I have just found this whole process to be pretty stressful knowing how hard it is to get into programs. Let me know what you all think! I've found it really difficult to find any guidance about applying to programs since most people I talk to don't even know what genetic counseling is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/qni013/should_i_take_a_gap_year_before_applying_to/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9965002536773682

To test if there is a higher degree of brain cancer in the that family when compared to non-brain cancer probands’ family, it matters how close the relative with cancer is, hence it could be weighted e.g. by how much dna the relative share with the proband, e.g. a sister with brain cancer is weighted at 50% while a grandparent is 25%??

Question about genetic testing of children,"  Hello everyone,

I read several guidelines on the ethical issues pertaining to genetic testing of children. I understand that genetic testing for children – in the absence of clearly beneficial treatments or effective preventive strategies – should be deferred until adulthood (that is for adult-onset disease). At this moment, is there any genetic test for children that is supported by the medical community (for adult-onset diseases)?(i.e. That enables children to obtain some form of treatment). And same question, but for childhood-onset disorders.

Guidelines and Frameworks for Genetic testing,"Hi guys,

I am curious to know if anyone could point me to some guidelines/framework, pertaining to genetic testing, which are currently used by health care providers in the US (or in Canada).

Are there any officially recognized ppv/sensibility/specificity/etc. (i.e. stats regarding clinical validity) that are considered to be bare minimums to be achieved before a test is used by health care providers? For example, lets say that I develop a test which purports to detect some of the genes associated with schizophrenia. What are the statistics pertaining to validity (any benchmarks?) that I have to present so that (1) my test is FDA approved, and (2) my test is deemed interesting enough to be recommended by health care providers/genetic counselors?

Also, legally/deontologically speaking, when such susceptibility/carrier screening test comes back with positive results, do genetic counselors/medics have a duty to share this information with the relatives of the testee?

I graduated in 2018 with an animal science degree/genetics minor, and after realizing my senior year of undergrad that I no longer wanted to go to vet school, have decided to pursue genetic counseling as a career. I was planning to apply for the 2020 cycle, but wanted to see what you thought my chances were with my current stats:

GPA: 3.1 (I know this is a low point on my application, I did relatively well on my pre-requisites for the GC programs that I am looking at but my overall GPA is still quite low)

GRE scores: 160 verbal (86th percentile), 158 quant (67th percentile), 4.5 writing (57th percentile) -- is this competitive? I am open to retaking it but I know a lot of schools don't place a whole lot of importance on GRE scores.

Experiences: I have met with and interviewed a GC (having some difficulty finding one to shadow in my area, but working on it), 4 months of crisis text hotline volunteering, worked as a TA for my genetics professor in undergrad, have over 2000 hours of lab research experience (I work full time as an oncology research technician), as well as several veterinary-related experiences (not sure if I would include these on my applications or not, as they are not technically relevant to the field).

I am concerned that since my decision to change career paths was relatively recent, I won't have enough of the volunteer experience that schools are looking for to balance out my low GPA.

Clinical Genetics and social anxiety...?,"Hey there. I’m at a crossroads in my life where I’m realizing that I’m not happy with my chosen career, and that I want to get back into science somehow. Genetics was always a favorite of mine, and I am considering genetic counseling because of the shorter degree (I’m 32 and wouldn’t realistically start until 33 or 34). The issue is that I have pretty bad social anxiety... like I can tolerate socializing and stuff to an extent, but the idea of having this sort of direct patient-provider interaction for 40 hours a week is daunting. Currently I teach at community college, and I’m in the classroom for about 10 hours a week... and that’s hard sometimes. 

So I’m wondering if there is a chance I could be happy in this field or if I should just give it up entirely. Are there any manifestations of clinical genetics where you don’t have to do as much of the “counseling” side, and are more involved in research or other “behind the scenes” type stuff? I really love genetics, researching different disorders, learning about all these different aspects and heritability and all sorts of things... but the prospect of spending so much one-on-one interaction with people (especially if they may become emotional about something) freaks me out.

A trove of genes uncover by Scientists,"  

Researchers at the Donnelly Center in Toronto have discovered that dozens of genes, previously thought to have comparable roles crosswise over various living beings, are in certainty one of a kind to people and could help clarify how our species came to exist.

These qualities code for a class of proteins known as translation components, or TFs, which control quality movement. TFs perceive explicit pieces of the [DNA](https://jacobspublishers.com/jacobs-journal-of-genetics-issn-2381-8735/) code called themes, and use them as landing locales to tie the DNA and turn qualities on or off. 

Past research had proposed that TFs which seem to be comparative crosswise over various living beings likewise tie comparable themes, even in species as assorted as natural product flies and people. However, another examination from Professor Timothy Hughes' lab, at the Donnelly Center for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, demonstrates this isn't generally the situation. 

Writing in the diary Nature Genetics, the researchers portray another computational strategy which enabled them to all the more precisely foresee theme successions each TF ties in a wide range of animal varieties. The discoveries uncover that some sub-classes of TFs are significantly more practically differing than recently suspected. 

""Indeed, even between firmly related species there's a non-unimportant part of TFs that are probably going to tie new arrangements,"" says Sam Lambert, previous alumni understudy in Hughes' lab who did the majority of the work on the paper and has since moved to the University of Cambridge for a postdoctoral stretch. 

""This implies they are probably going to have novel capacities by controlling various qualities, which might be significant for species contrasts,"" he says.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/bubjxc/a_trove_of_genes_uncover_by_scientists/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.946316123008728
Career paths in genetics (advice needed),"This post is me just kind of thinking out loud and trying to figure out my options in terms of a future career, so sorry in advance if it is a little all over the place lol. Just a little background, I got my degree in Cell & Molecular Bio and a minor in psych. After graduating, I initially became interested in genetic counseling, so I started shadowing GCs, did some online crisis counseling, took a couple extra classes, etc. It seemed like the perfect career at first because it combined my love of genetics, psychology, and teaching together; however, I eventually realized this path wasn't for me. I'm not very good at handling emotional situations, and I also have a disorder that sometimes affects my verbal communication—two things that are central to this career. Now I'm left struggling to find something else I am passionate about and could see myself pursuing as a career. I have thought about entering academia briefly, but after doing further research (and hearing stories from friends and from others online) I've come to the conclusion that it's not something I could see myself doing. I see myself much more in the clinical side of things. However, I know that I don't want to be a medical doctor, so clinical geneticist is also out of the picture. Something that I was highly interested in for a bit was clinical variant science/analysis, however I heard that job prospects are supposed to drop in upcoming years due to AI replacing this position, so that one is out too.

Some additional info on me:

* My main interest is genetic and molecular mechanisms of disease (including gene regulation, signal transduction, internal signaling pathways, etc); basically the whys and hows of molecular processes and how deviations in normal functioning at this level can lead to disorder.
* As stated earlier, I enjoy teaching/tutoring. I like digging deep into difficult topics and breaking them down to help others understand them. I've been told I am very good at explaining complex processes in a way that is easy to grasp. I think that's one of the main reasons genetic counseling appealed to me, because you get to teach patients about their diagnosis and help them better understand the *whys* and *hows* behind it.
* I have a very analytical brain and love problem solving, so I need a job that challenges me in these ways.
* I am curious about bioinformatics. I only have minimal knowledge on it at the moment but I think it is a really interesting field.
* I am good with my hands and enjoy building things/putting things together (don't know if this relates to anything but thought I'd add it just in case).
* I'm great at planning/organizing.
* I'd preferably be interested in a job with flexible hours or where I can make my own hours.

With all these things in mind, what other jobs are there that that might be a good match for me? Also, if you are willing to, I would be interested in hearing what y'all do as a career, and perhaps why you like it and why you decided to enter that field. I'm just looking to expand my horizons a little more and hopefully be able to decide what my next steps are career-wise, so any help or advice is welcome. Thanks in advance!

Is Genetic Counseling emotionally draining?,"I'm about to begin my second semester of University and I haven't shadowed a GC yet (am going to very soon), but as I was reading through this page, I read some stories and thought that maybe some aspects of genetic counseling could be emotionally draining. So to people with experience, do you feel the job may be emotionally draining, especially when talking to people about options such as abortion or discarding embryos. I wouldn't say I was exactly pro life, but the idea of aborting a baby is not emotionally easy to think about.

Interview Advice from a Current Student Who Was a Hot Mess,"I know it's a little late in the game to be offering advice, but I'm a current first-year student, and I just wanted to share a few things I observed (and heard from my classmates,) things I did well, and blunders I made for my interview last year. I only interviewed at one school, so I don't claim to have a wide breadth of personal experience, but hopefully this helps someone! Other current students: Feel free to chime in!

- If you didn't get accepted for an interview, the school still may think you're qualified, it's just that you may have been number forty-three on a list where the top forty were given interviews. Don't give up if you really want to be a part of this career. Work on getting more experience with which to bolster your application for next year. You can also ask programs what you could do to strengthen your application.

- If you were accepted for an interview, it means that on paper, the school feels you are qualified to be a counselor. You step onto that campus on equal footing with all of the other interviewees. (Likewise, when you get accepted, you will step back on that campus on equal footing with everyone else, but this time you will likely remain on equal footing. You will all have your strengths and weaknesses. No one is better than anyone else.) Likewise, if you don't get accepted, you should definitely ask what you could have done to strengthen your interview.

- If you have access to practice interview services through your school, etc., use them! (I tried to make an appointment too late and ended up not being able to do this, but even though I got in, I wish I had practiced.)

- Naturally, try to rest well. Naturally, I didn't.

If you are being hosted the night before the interview:

- If you can avoid doing so, try not to ask to be hosted for more than one night. I don't have a problem with this, but at least one other student in my program found it rude.
- You also might want to try to avoid being hosted by a student if your flight/drive will have you arriving very late (after 10, I would say.) Same as above: Me, no problem. Others, may be problematic.
- Make sure you discuss breakfast with your host! I didn't think to, and I ended up doing half my interviews on nothing but a cup of coffee.

As for the interviews:

- If you know who your interviews are going to be with, look them up. What are their specialties? Do they have published papers? If so, if you have time, try to browse one and ask any questions that come up. This is something I did, and I don't know if it helped, but it certainly didn't hurt.
- Ask. Questions. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/48aqs7/genetic_counseling_interviews_what_i_wish_i_asked/) has some great ideas.
- Each school is going to have different types of questions. Some schools want to assess your critical thinking skills, creativity, ability to recover from an unexpected question, etc. Some programs might ask you directly your views on certain issues. Some might just stick with the typical interview format.
- Make sure you can explain what you did in terms of shadowing/volunteering/internships. This goes double for research.
- Don't cry.
- We asked our program directors which interviewee was the worst they interviewed, and they brought up the ""used car salesman,"" who just gave off the vibe of a used car salesman and tried to sell himself like a car.
- If you are not sure you want to be a counselor, but ""it's just a two-year program,"" no. No, no, no. They will definitely weed you out, whether or not you bring it up.
- Make sure you understand the profession and what it's about. You probably got this through shadowing/internships. I didn't do either of those (which is probably why I was rejected from most of the schools I applied to,) but I watched the Master Genetic Counselor series of videos to gain some insight.

Group discussions & other interactions

- If there is a point at which you come together to discuss things, make sure you stay respectful. No one wants the interviewee who is shutting down other peoples' opinions and telling them they don't make sense/would never work/are ridiculous, to be a counselor.
- At my school and potentially many others, the interviewers will ask the current students whether they had any negative impressions of any of the interviewees. Again, stay respectful at all times, but don't stay so formal that you come off as a kiss-up.

For fun, here's how much of a hot mess my interview day was:

Got sick the weekend before the interview. Had an exam the day before, the day of, and the day after interviews (should have checked my schedule, but I was just so excited to get an interview that I dove right in.) Got the exam the day of moved because I was driving 5.5 hours to interview and staying overnight. Left immediately after my exam (in human molecular genetics,) and made the drive.
Arrived at my student host's apartment at about ten-thirty, unable to make the dinner they were having. Hadn't prepared a lick for the interviews, so I stayed up until two Googling questions and preparing. Woke up at six. Host kindly gave me coffee. I didn't think about breakfast, so I didn't get to eat it. Interview started with an overview of what the program has to offer, then I had my two morning interviews. Next was a tour, complimentary lunch, and the weekly noon conference. Even though I wasn't sure if it was a good move, I was bold enough to answer some of the questions that were addressed to the current students (the answers of which I only knew because of the genetics exam the previous day! I think this is half of why I got in.) There were two more interviews (one of the interviewers was also sick, which made me feel better,) and a paper discussion in which I don't feel I said enough. I really hope that the fact that I was accepted helps boost your confidence!

Best of luck! I hope I meet some of you the week after next ;)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/48jsju/interview_advice_from_a_current_student_who_was_a/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9660556316375732

Fragile X Carrier,"Hello,

My husband and I started the process of IVF last year. As we went through the testing, we discovered that my husband has the pre-mutation for Fragile X. We decided that we would transfer male embryos to prevent passing this on. We didn’t anticipate it would take us a year to get viable embryos. 

Today we found out that our first and only two euploid embryos are girls. As I understand it, my daughter would be a carrier for Fragile X, potentially have fertility issues, and potentially a child with Fragile X. Would it be selfish to transfer one of these embryos? If/when she wants to have children, what counseling would she need? Are there other health effects that I am not considering?

Thank you for your input. I apologize if this isn’t the right forum for this type of question- my mind is just racing.

Why are we doing a second test for Beckwith-Wiedmann for my 6 year old?,"Quick back story - my 6 year old daughter has always been 99th+ percentile for height and weight. Due to her size, we were referred to a pediatric geneticist. 

After discovering my child’s dad has hemihypertrophy, geneticist recommended testing for Beckwith-Wiedmann Syndrome despite my daughter having no other symptoms.

We did the CDKN1C test and it came back negative. Also did an ultrasound which was normal.

Now the geneticist says she wants to do a CMA test. 

1. I’m confused why we didn’t do both tests at the same time. 

2. What is the difference between the CMA and CDKN1C? Why did we do CDKN1C first?

3. Could she have a negative CDKN1C, but still have BWS?

I’m pretty confused by all of this so if anyone could ELI5 that would be so helpful.

Have had 2  EUS tests whereby fluid was taken from IPMN cysts and sent for PancreaSeq testing at UPenn. Both times two mutations were identified. KRAS g12r and GNAS r201c.

 Mom has been thru chemo and is now in radiation therapy for a large and inoperable Abdominal Lymphoma. Mom is 77. Today, the results came back from her 120 some odd gene cancer panel... and it was negative for mutations as well.

"17 weeks pregnant, partner and I just found out we were BOTH carriers of SCO2 gene. Urgent input needed.","ScO2 Gene Carriers - input urgently needed!!!

Hello, my partner and I found out we were pregnant back in August. We had a 13 week NT scan which measured abnormal at 3.8mm. We had scheduled an appointment with a geneticist ahead of time because of my partners family history. His sister and her husband were both carriers (unknowingly) of the ScO2 gene and they only found out because their baby girl that they delivered passed about a month after birth. The geneticist they met with said that the odds of them both carrying the gene are infinitesimally small. 

We knew about this history but also knew the odds of both carrying this mutation were low. My partner  also as a CHD so we were more curious about that as a potential issue more than a rare genetic mutation. 

Fast forward today, we get an urgent call from our geneticist that we BOTH carry this ScO2 gene too. The geneticist actually asked if we were related on the phone, that's how rare this is.

I'm in shock and devastated at the news. I'm pretty confident that we will have to terminate. 

My question is....the likelihood of both my partner and his sister having the mutation also finding partners that both carry this mutation..can some one out there tell me the odds??? This seems so improbable. I feel like the odds were greater that we were all sitting in the same room or drinking the same water and genes mutated at the same time.

Chromosome 11 uniparental disomy question,"Hi all,

I have a balanced translocation discovered through RPL testing. I have had 5 miscarriages between 5 and 9 weeks, and I have a (seemingly) healthy 15 month old boy. All previous pregnancies were unassisted.

We are now beginning IVF and pursuing PGT-SR testing. I had finally started to feel optimistic about the whole process when I learned that BT carriers have a higher chance of UPD in their offspring which cannot be detected through PGT-SR, only amnio. It seems one of these at-risk chromosomes is 11, which is involved with my BT.

How worried about this do I need to be? Is it likely worth taking on the risks of miscarriage with amnio to confirm that the fetus has genetic information from both parents on 11? Would we be able to determine this through any other less invasive in-utero testing such as NIPT? We are using Cooper Genomics for PGT - since they have the technology to determine which parent aneuploidy errors come from, could they also determine if chromosomes were inherited from both parents in the lab?

Carriers of M34T and 35Delg variants of GJB2 non syndromic healing loss,"Eta: typo in post title - Hearing loss


I am trying to gather as much information as possible on the potential resulting manifestation of these two variants - M34T and 35Delg - presenting in a compound heterozygous situation. 

I have had genetic counseling already, along with my partner, but found it very basic. We understand the risk of inheritance. We have already dealt with the loss of our baby from a null variant of SLOS. But the GC would not elaborate on any variance of risk in this case, other than to say, if a child is affected, they will almost certainly be severely deaf and  cochlear implants would be the next step (if chosen).

I find this a bit confusing as my understanding from reading (online medical papers) is that there can be a range from mild to profound healing loss. M34T seemingly can be associated with milder HL, but would 35Delg, as the more severe variant, result in more severe outcome?

I definitely don't want to question the experienced GC and I'm not a scientist.
But I'd appreciate any further take on this (in the full knowledge it isn't medical advice) because I wonder if he was decidedly preparing us for the worst case outcome. 

I really would appreciate any input. Thanks very much.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/13i5e1r/carriers_of_m34t_and_35delg_variants_of_gjb2_non/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.8147805333137512

Genetic counseling: how to get into this field?,"Hi I’m semi new here to Reddit! I wanted to get some perspective on becoming a Genetic Counselor, so thanks for reading!

About me: I am a stay at home parent getting ready to get back into the workforce! I’m in Southern California, and have a degree in Illustration. I’m also in my mid 30s.
I want to get into prenatal/pediatric genetic counseling and would love to teach in higher education someday! Problem is, I have 0 background and experience. I don’t care how long it takes me or if I have to get a second undergrad to get into grad school honestly!

Having said that, I had some thoughts but no idea which direction would be the best; I know I need to get some sort of experience (counseling, lab work, or teaching) to get into a masters along with some undergrad requirements (which I don’t have!) so my options are:

- obtain a second bachelors in biology (I was thinking cell and molecular bio at UCSD or biology at CSUSM) and get some work experience while in the undergrad program to prepare me for a masters at UC Irvine or UCLA

-obtain a certificate or associates degree in biology at my local community college and try to get some work experience and then apply for the masters programs

- or just try my hardest to gain any sort of experience and dive into the masters!

That’s pretty much it! I appreciate the time you guys took to read this! I don’t have anyone who could give me a reference/letter of recommendation if I did the masters right away.

I’m wondering about how different variants affect the odds of passing cystic fibrosis on. I had no idea that there were so many variants - I had really only heard about delta F508. If it’s a 25% chance of passing cystic fibrosis on if both parents are carriers, do the odds change if they are different variants? This might be a completely ignorant assumption (I really didn’t learn much about genetics in school), but if one parent had the common delta F508 variant and one a more uncommon gating or nonsense mutation, would it still be the same 25% chance?

Rare combination of genetic anomalies,"Hi all,
Hoping this might be a place to post our situation with our unborn baby to see if anyone has heard of or has insight on the genetic anomalies that have been found. 

We recently had an amniocentesis drawn after an abnormal growth scan indicating growth restriction as well as congenital heart defects. 

Results indicated a small deletion on the q arm of the 15th chromosome (26.2>26.3) and a larger partial duplication on the q arm of the 18th chromosome 12.3>q23.  

We are able to find a good amount of information on the specific section of the small deletion on 15, but not a lot of information on the partial duplication of 18.  I know with a full duplication this would be trisomy 18 or edwards syndrome, so we could end up with a variation of that prognosis.  But I was hoping maybe someone that knows their stuff might be able to direct me to some resources. 

Obviously with the combination of these two together, we’re looking at a craps shoot.  But I just want to find anything I can to try and prepare myself for whatever outcomes I can.

"22q11.21 DUPLICATION: Passed from me to fetus, looking for clarity","I’ll post the results in the comments but I’m hoping someone here can give me some clarity. I’ve met with a GC but waiting to meet with the actual geneticist.

It seems like a lot of people have a 3mb deletion which indicates  DiGeorges and can present a lot of issues. My report says 733 kb *duplication*. This would be essentially spanning 1/4 less of the chromosome and thus affecting less symptoms, no? Anecdotally it does seem like the deletions are more severe. Based on ultrasound and fetal echo the baby has no physical abnormalities so far.

I have the exact same duplication and I have basically no issues. Some recurrent UTIs that quickly hit my kidneys and OCD (mild and easily managed). I know the direction of severity is wide with 22q but does anything in my report indicate that I might be able to expect my baby to have a favorable outcome like mine? I never would have even known I had this if I hadn’t done prenatal testing. 

The epigenetics and coding vs non-coding of it all is very confusing. Does “suggests reduced penetrance” on the lab report indicate mild expression of the duplication?

Applying to programs 20 years post Bachelor's,"Hello!  I recently discovered that genetic counseling was a thing, and I'm extremely interested in digging more into the requirements for getting accepted into a program.  The particular program I'm interested in is one of the most competitive, but I'm an adult with a mortgage so it's really my only option geographically.   I have a Bachelor's in Biology, with minors in Chem and Psych (I went to a small liberal art's school with a ton of collaboration between departments).  I have taken Genetics, Organic Chem, and Biochem, however...I graduated in 2004.  The advancements in genetics in the last 20 years are probably incomparable to what I learned in undergrad, say nothing about how long ago I learned it.  Would it be worth my time and money to take a graduate-level Intro to Genetics course BEFORE I even apply?  Or is this something that would be part of the actual course-work once I get into the program?  

As a side-note; my career up until this point has been in animal care.  I have a strong educational background, and some project-management experience through my volunteer position with my professional organization, but I have almost no counseling/crisis management experience.  In researching this career, it seems like programs like applicants from diverse backgrounds, but would it be a necessity to volunteer with something like grief counseling or domestic violence shelter work?  My board of director's position is set to expire mid 2021 so I would have the time to re-direct my energies into other volunteer opportunities.

Online education has not been it for me since this whole situation with COVID happened. I just finished taking organic chemistry I but I got a C- overall and for my bio degree I need at least a C. Fortunately my school is offering us the option of choosing S/U grading for our classes, so it wouldn’t hurt my GPA and this would allow me to fulfill the Ochem requirement for my degree. However, my advisor said that if I choose to go to professional school, some schools might be picky about that.

Conflicted about future directions,"Hi,

I'm going to start out with saying I'm in a weird time in my life where I'm not ready to enter a degree program for the next year or so due to health issues. But my life being on hold hasn't stopped me from thinking of what's next for me.

I have 7+ years of lab experience, in cancer biology and developmental biology. I love it. I am most interested in studying human disease in model organisms.

But I've also become very interested in human genetics and variant interpretation. I think it's a great bigger-picture piece to basic wet lab research on single pathways or cell functions, etc. I've spent the last few years studying disordered development as a result of ribosomopathies, and my initial interest in human genetics has really changed my (and the lab I work in) approach to studying the ribosome's role in disease. Now we read case reports and scan ClinVar to help direct what tissues we investigate and to curate ideas on gene function investigations.

I want to keep doing this kind of research, a mix of forward and reverse genetics, with some omics thrown in too. But I don't know if a staff scientist position in a private or academic associated lab is the best fit for this type of work. I know it depends partly on the lab. But part of me thinks there are clinical labs that must do this kind of work every day? 

I've toyed with the idea of becoming a Cgc, to help me work in a clinical lab setting. I care a lot about being able to communicate my research to anyone, and making science accessible. I am definitely able to present my work in a research setting, and am comfortable talking with anyone, including kids. I think this would make me a good genetic counselor. I just don't know if being a genetic counselor and interfacing with patients is what I truly want to do. I love working in the lab, but I also like parts of research that occur outside the lab, whether it be speaking at conferences, or teaching students at small workshops, doing community outreach, etc  I feel like if I resign myself to a traditional lab rat position, I won't have the opportunity to see how the work I do helps people on a more personal level.

Don't get me wrong, I understand and value the importance of basic research. A footnote on a potential pathway interactor may change a patient's variant interpretation, be it for cancer or developmental disease, it might be key to helping someone else develop a new drug or therapy.I just want to help other people understand the value in basic research too.

I don't think I can see myself as a Cgc in a strictly counselor sense, seeing patients all day long. For one thing, I can't be on my feet all day, which is a small part of why I definitely don't think getting an MD is for me.

I used to work with someone who was a senior scientist / post doc in a cancer biology for maybe 15-20 years. She reached the top of the pay scale for her position and was essentially forced to become a pi, which she was definitely more than qualified for, and she was repeatedly offered her own lab space etc. So she took the advancement. And absolutely hated it. She wanted to do research, not manage money and not manage people all day. She left after 4 months, and spent a year or more transitioning her research to collaborators etc. And she immediately entered a genetic counseling program. She has a strong family history of weird cancer, and she is fascinated by genetic syndromes and is passionate about figuring out her family's affliction. I'm sure this is partly why she started working in a basic research lab in a comprehensive cancer center in the first place. But my point is, the academia drive to push to the terminal position of a pi basically killed her. I think she may officially return to working in a lab one day, but definitely more a clinical lab, working with patient samples directly rather than just studying cancer pathways. I just really admire her choices, like the strength she had to actually go after what she wants, and make what she wants to do a real position/option. I want to be like her, but maybe skip the midlife crisis and go into my next step(s) knowing what I want and how to get there. 

Anyway. PhD in molecular/cell/dev bio? Human genetics? Cgc? Thoughts?

In need of validation that I should pursue genetic testing due to my family history...,"So I'll get right to the business. Basically my mother and aunt and great aunt (all on my mothers side) have all gone through menopause around age 35. I have a sister who is early 30's who was also recently told that her hormones are ""off"" and that she should expect to go through early menopause. On top of this I have a cousin who has also been known to be ""slow"" and who's daughter seems to be delayed (speech problems/delay, Diagnosed with Hypothyroidism, short stature) I also have an Uncle who seems to have an intellectual disability and maybe possibly even high functioning autistic.

I've always had issues with my periods and was placed on birth control around age 14. My mom explained this happened to her but at least I'll go through menopause at 35... I was not familiar with sexual education at the time and did not think this was odd, just kinda thought this was the appropriate age to go through menopause... (I know sex education sucks in my state). Fast forward to now, I understand the average age for menopause is 50ish and am concerned with the history of intellectual disability and very strong history of menopause at age 35.

I was just wondering if:

1. this concern is validated enough to warrant going to a genetics provider?
2. if so, what may be possibly going on? (I'm kinda suspicious of fragile-x but unsure if it could be something else)

Prosaposin deficiency: Can someone please ELI5?,"First of all: On cell. Sorry!

My 7-year old son recently had an MRI to rule out a brain tumor before being referred for DNA sequencing/genetics testing. My husband and I gave blood for the DNA testing too. The children's hospital just called regarding the results and said they need our son to do a urine test to confirm potential Prosaposin deficiency and actually warned me ""not to Google it"" because ""it's extremely unlikely that he has the active gene. Right now we only know that he's a carrier and so is his father."" 

So *of course* I Googled it... but I don't understand the medical jargon. 

Can someone dumb this down for me? Specifically: What *is* Prosaposin deficiency? And what are the symptoms? 

I promise not to overreact or panic. I spent four months awaiting an available MRI date while coming to grips with the statement that all of my child's symptoms ""coincided with a potential brain tumor or abnormality in the cerebellum""... which was ruled out... so there isn't really anything you can say to shock me. I just want to know what exactly we're dealing with. We have three other children who could all be potential carriers, as well as a brand new niece who is going to need testing too. 

Any info would be appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/cob7gk/prosaposin_deficiency_can_someone_please_eli5/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9992967844009399

Balanced translocation of the 13th and 14th chromosome,"Recently I discovered that most of my family has this chromosomal abnormality. Personally I'm very interested in genetics (f18), and have been trying to read up in academic journals about the issue. I am generally just trying to find out the likelihood of infertility, and what kinds of odds I'm up against. It is kind of overwhelming looking through the journals, but I enjoy learning. Is there a generally accepted answer for this within the medical community, or is it too variable to really know? I just don't wanna get my hopes up! I should be seeing a genetic counselor in a few months, but was wondering if anyone here would have a general answer for me. 

To clarify, during amniotic tests, I had trisomy(13;14), and I am obviously fully functioning with no abnormalities. But my other family members got the kariotypes done and came up with the Balanced robertsonian translocation (13;14).

Looking for LGG fellowship guidance,"Posting here for some career advice. I'm currently in the final stretch of my genetics PhD, and have been looking into post-grad options. I want to switch gears from academic research into something more clinical, and I think a Laboratory Genetics and Genomics Fellowship is a good fit for what I want to do going forward. However, my conversations with people in the field have given me the impression that I won't be a competitive applicant since I don't have any clinical experience (I currently study Drosophila). One person recommended I take a few years and work as a medical lab tech, but from the job postings I've been looking at (in New York), it seems like no one will hire me unless I am certified. The alphabet soup of medical lab certifications is a bit confusing to me, and I'm having trouble finding the type of training that will suit me best. There are 1-year certificate programs that will qualify me for MLS(ASCP) certification, but I'm wondering if an MB(ASCP) would better prepare me for an LGG fellowship. Are there other paths that I should consider? Is a PhD with only an MB(ASCP) employable as a clinical lab tech, or is an MLS(ASCP) generally required as well? With a PhD will I be too overqualified to be hired as a tech to begin with?

Cousins with genetic condition - how might it affect my children?,"Hey reddit,

My Aunt C (blood-relative) had three kids with Uncle S.

These three kids have ""unclassified leuko dystrophy"" (allegedly) - all three are in wheelchairs, two of them are also mentally disabled and can't really talk at all. Noone seems to be very sure, or know much about their condition.

Aunt C then had another child with Mr T, who is completely fine.

Myself, and some of my other cousins are likely to be having children of our own in the next 5 or so years. **Is there anything we can do to see if our offspring may be affected by this condition?**

Many thanks.

Preparing for genetic counselor,"I am a long-time sufferer of OCD - genetic results revealed that I am predisposed to low serotonin, high dopamine, and high glutamate.

I have already made an appointment with a genetic counselor (December 3rd).

Do you guys have any recommendations for how I should prepare for my appointment to help her make a diagnosis?

I know that I am lacking in certain places like counseling experience, but I was wondering if what I'm doing now is enough? Is crisis text line enough experience, are my GRE scores good enough, to become a good candidate for the programs? Is there any where else I can improve in my resume? Also I am located in the San Jose/Sunnyvale area so I was wondering if anyone knows any volunteering opportunities I can do to boost my resume.

Noonans Syndrome & Marfans=miscarriages?,"I’m a 31 year old female that suffers from recurrent miscarriage. Spouse is 34 male with no known health issues other than high sperm DNA fragmentation and trigeminal neuralgia due to a botched wisdom tooth surgery. I and my identical twin sister have had health issues our whole lives but have no diagnosis despite lots of testing.

On my side only 1 maternal great aunt out of maybe 8 great aunts has a history of recurrent miscarriage, but for her it was eventually cured by progesterone shots a long time ago. My husband's mother claims her mom had 3 miscarriages specifically with boys only, but eventually was able to produce 3 girls.

To attempt to overcome my husband and i’s recurrent miscarriage issues we recently attempted the first part of ivf with PGS screening of the embryos. We also took a screening test called Counsyl that looks for many common disorders, but it came back normal for both of us.

Dr called last week to say all 5 embryos sent for testing returned results of abnormal.

He suggested perhaps we have a translocation our previous standard resolution karyotype couldn’t find \(older technology?\).

4 of the 5 embryos had the same deletion on chromosome 12 in section 24.13. He forgot to mention the issue with embryo 5 as he decided he wanted to consult with the people at cooper geononics about the possibility of a missed translocation prior to discussing things further. He didn’t go into detail but seemed to imply there were multiple chromosome defects in addition to chromosome 12 on the each embryo, so I'm thinking those must be on chromosome 15 since he ordered a test for that too.

He ordered a high resolution karyotype from quest and a FISH probe for chromosome 12 and 15 for my spouse and i. After my own simple uniformed google research i’m wondering if my spouse may have a mild case of noonans syndrome and if i have a mild case of marfans syndrome. Does this seem plausible? Is it feasible for us to create a viable embryo if we have these issues? All our embryos make it to 6.5 weeks with a standard heartbeat but then spontaneously pass away.

We haven't spoken to a genetic counselor yet. Our IVF Dr is a genetics focused specialist so I'm hopeful he will point us in the direction of a counselor once our test results come back.

"What is a clinical genetic variant scientist? Job description, career prospects, etc...","So I just graduated last year with my bachelor's in cell/molecular bio, and I'm currently taking a gap year (or two) and learning more about different careers and trying to figure myself out and where I want to go from here. 

Anyway, I was messing around on reddit a few days ago and saw a comment that mentioned something about being a genetic variant scientist. I wish I could remember where I saw this comment, that way I could go back to the original post and ask the commentor to explain more about the career. I've tried to look up the job description online however there isn't that much information out there on this specific career, so I wanted to come on here and see if any of you might be familiar with it. I was just wondering what the typical day looks like, what the typical activities/duties are, what the education requirements are, that kind of thing. I was also interested in the prospects and growth of this career. The person who posted the original comment mentioned that within the next decade or so the career will not exist because machines/computers will have taken it over by then. I'm wondering then, is it even worth it to pursue this career if I decide that I'm interested in it, or will I just be wasting my time since it will become an obsolete position in the near future? 

It seems like an exciting career from what I have read so far. Plus, I'm already considering genetic counseling and it looks like the two are really similar (at least is seems so, most of the job postings I've found list an M.Sc. in genetic counseling as a possible education requirement option). 

Right now I'm just trying to consider all of my options, so if you have any additional info you think might help, I'd really appreciate it! Thanks in advance! :)

3. What types of software and hardware do you use? Brand names specifically, please.
4. What are some pains you had to deal with in your work? Did you manage to find solutions for some of them?
5. Where do you think your profession is going in the next 5 years? Do you see it becoming more common for people to seek consults independently?

Fragile x permutation carrier - afraid,"I’m pregnant with a baby girl and just found out that I’m a permutation carrier for fragile x. I am socked by the news - we have no family history of this or autism, I opted in for all the optional tests without really asking about them.

Help me understand this genetic testing result after my mmc please. :(,"I experienced a missed miscarriage one month ago at nine weeks gestation, with the baby having ceased growth at six weeks. Consequently, I underwent a D&C procedure. I requested genetic testing on the tissue/fetus, but I am unsure how to interpret the results.

Could someone please help me understand the findings? 
Based on your expertise and experience, would it be advisable to consult a genetic counselor and pursue further testing? I am hesitant to proceed if it will not be beneficial for future pregnancies.

RESULT: Maternal Cell Contamination
MICROARRAY RESULT: n/a
Clinical Interpretation: Maternal cell contamination (MCC) was detected.
Insufficient fetal DNA detected for analysis.
Lab Note: Since maternal cell contamination was identified, an additional dissection was run in an attempt to obtain a fetal result. See result below.

RESULT: Normal Male
MICROARRAY RESULT: arr(1-22)x2,(XY)x1
Clinical Interpretation: Normal male result.
Lab Note: Of note, two or more tracks of homozygosity >8 Mb in size were detected. This is likely consistent with identity by descent. Details of the regions of homozygosity can be provided by Natera upon request. Couples in which identity by descent is revealed may be at a higher risk for autosomal recessive diseases. Genetic counseling is a recommended option for all couples undergoing genetic testing.

Why can’t gene variants be confined to the placenta?,"Hi all

Can someone explain in layman’s terms why a gene variant cannot be confined to the placenta?

Background: we had CVS done with our current pregnancy and I understand that for some chromosomal abnormalities there is a possibility for placental origin while the embryo is unaffected. However, we also had WES done coming back with a variant and our GC said that since this is a gene and not a chromosome it cannot be of placental origin. I struggle to understand it - but I am obviously not a GC.

Support identifying genetic disease,"Hi everyone! 

I know this is a little bit of a strange request, but I have a special needs child and assume she has a genetic condition. I need some help to narrow down options for testing.

Of course we have done several assessments, but genetic testing is very expensive and none of the conditions our paed and developmental paed recommended to test seem all that fitting (down syndrome, abnormalities of the sex chromosomes etc). I've been reading up on those conditions and they do not seem to match my kid.

So if anyone could give some pointers for specific conditions I'd be able to have tested I'd appreciate!

She's currently diagnosed with Autism and moderate intellectual disability.

Other unusual characteristics/Reasons why I believe there might be a genetic cause:

\- She is extremely short: Born at full term, 42cm, 2kg and currently 8.5 years about 106cm

\- she has unusual eyebrows, they are quite prominent with a strong arch/pointed 

\- Her features are very different from all other family members

\- She has gastrointestinal problems and stool holding (I know this might be caused by autism)

\- She is extremely loving, doesn't fear strangers, will sit on anyone's lap or follow random people (I know this might also be caused by autism, but appears quite different from other autistic kids I have met)

\- Her hair is a bit unusual: almost straight, thin, only came in at about 3 years and grows very slow on the sites and a bit faster on top. It could be because she's mixed race, but all other mixed kids I've met have full heads of curls

&#x200B;

So I know there isn't so much to base on here, and the major reason I believe she may have some kind of genetic condition is her short height coupled with the ID and autism. Happy to give more details and looking forward to any pointers by the experts :))

Thoughts on the pardon of Kathleen Folbigg follow petition from scientists and genetic investigations published in EP Europace?,"Kathleen Folbigg is an Australian woman who was jailed for 20 years following the deaths of her four children on the basis that there was “no evidence of natural causes” and her personal diary issues provided by her husband.

Recent inquiry suggested that there may have been genetic causes for all four deaths and some 90 prominent scientists called for her release. The authors of the linked paper (the basis of the genetic arguments you’ll see being discussed on reddit currently) suggest calmodulinopathy emerges as a reasonable explanation for a natural cause of two of the four deaths.

A previously unreported variant in CALM2 the girls inherited from their mother is suggested to have a potentially mild arrhythmia affect that, coupled with their respiratory infections could have predisposed them to sudden death. 

The paper also details variants identified in the boys in the BSN gene. A typically adult onset dominant epilepsy associated gene. Autosomal recessive affection not reported before in humans but seen in mice (if I recall correctly sorry it’s been a spell since I read it thoroughly).

I'm currently a sophomore studying psychology with the plan to get my masters in genetic counseling.
However, I've been playing with the idea of going farther and becoming a clinical geneticist. My advisor isn't much help, sadly.

Should I change to a pre-med major? Once graduated, do I need to look for a medical school that has a specific clinical genetics path? If it helps, I want to specialize in pediatrics. I'm very lost on how med school works exactly.

My nephew has unfortunately suffered from two instances of lymphoma, the circumstances of the ‘relapse’ didn’t seem normal so they sent him off for DNA testing.

It was found that my sister has this damaged gene but they described it as “mosiac”-ed in her DNA.

I have done some Googling but since I have no clue about genetics I don’t really know what this means. Could this mean this has randomly occurred in her and then passed to her son? Or is it still possible that it’s further up the chain and I will still need testing.

I Have Several Questions Regarding Variant Classification,"Multi-parter, but I'd appreciate any thoughts. 

1. Regarding the biochemical impact of amino acid substitutions, I often see conflicting statements in separate submissions for the same variant (e.g. one submission says a change is conservative while another says the change is non-conservative). I'd assume this is because they are using different definitions of conservative vs. non-conservative, but what is the standard for this type of thing? Would Grantham distance/score work? 

2. That brings me to sequence conservation. What is the standard for this? Are there thresholds for scores like phyloP or PhastCons or is there something else that is used?

3. Where do BS1 thresholds (allele frequency is greater than expected for the disorder) come from? I often see ClinVar submissions cite a specific MAF for this and I'm not sure where that number comes from.

Need help writing fiction which involves use of CRISPR for clinical genetics,"Hello there.

I'm writing a script for a series, where the protagonist is quite into DIY CRISPR research and experimentation. He is in a very Faustian mood (which later plays a huge role) and wants to create a panacea through genetic means as his main project. And I would be grateful for some advice on what I've come up with in terms of actual plausibility. I'm not a geneticist, so if I'm making factual mistakes in what I'm saying, please point those out.

It's common knowledge that around 98% of the human genome codes nothing. The main idea of the protagonist is to put coded genes taken from different animals with specific adaptations, in this space, which normally codes nothing. They remain inactive and dormant though, so the human, modified before birth, grows and develops as he or she would normally be. Zero influence on physical traits, personality (part of it is gene-based as far as I'm aware), etc, so we are kind of leaving the morally grey zone of human gene modification.

However, when a serious medical condition happens, e.g. cancer, a lost limb, degradation of organs due to aging, those encoded and inactive genes come into play. We can use some kind of chemical gene activators injected into the bloodstream, which I've seen articles about. Through metabolism those reach every cell in the organism, activating required genes almost simultaneously, to achieve whatever result is needed. The organism does not ""fight"" the genetically modified part, because the whole organism is already modified. When the illness of some kind is cured, the gene deactivates either by the limited work time of the injected activator or by injecting a deactivator for this specific gene.

How plausible this would be? The series are kinda-sci-fi, set in the nearest future, so we can have little conventions, but I would like it to be somewhat achievable, if enough research, work, and money are put into this.

If you have a more futuristic and even wild idea, sharing those here would be much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/k3bzsb/need_help_writing_fiction_which_involves_use_of/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9969784021377563

Can someone explain to me the process behind using CRISPR-Cas9 to treat/cure patients with sickle cell anemia?,"Is this a treatment or a cure? Is it still in clinical trials? My understanding is that we take some of the patient's bone marrow cells and then, in the lab, we use CRISPR to change the mutation in the DNA of their own cells and then we put the cells back into the patient's bone. If someone could confirm everything I just said is correct I would appreciate it. Some other questions I have are: how long does this treatment work for? Is it a one-time thing where they take my cells, do the CRISPR thing, put my cells back and then I can make my own normal RBC's for the rest of my life, or is it something where it would work for a certain amount of time and then I would need to come back to the clinic every so often to get injected with the CRISPR-corrected cells?

How to prepare for GC program applications while working full time?,"Hi everyone! I am looking for some advice for someone who is thinking about changing their career path! I graduated from college with a BS in biology, minor in neuroscience. My plan was to do research in a lab for a year or two and then go on to apply for PhD programs, do a postdoc after that, and basically do research for the rest of my life. However, I have been working in a lab for over a year now and I don't love it as much as I thought I did. I still like research, but I don't want that to be all I do. I find myself wishing I could work with patients and more directly help people. I've been reading about genetic counseling and I am really interested in it! However, since this career wasn't even on my radar while I was in undergrad, I know that if I were to submit my application today, it would be lacking in some areas. So I am hoping to build my application over the next year to become a more competitive applicant, while also keeping my lab job so that I can pay rent. Plus, I'd like learn more about what it's like to be a genetic counselor to make sure I really do like it before I apply, since I already changed my mind once in regard to my career path.
What I'm wondering is: how much shadowing/advocacy experience is necessary for a strong application? Shadowing a GC for a day doesn't seem like enough, but what is a good amount? On top of this I will also need to prepare for and take the GRE. Does it seem feasible to do all this in time to apply next year while also working full time?

I am posting here because I am wondering if I have any sort of chance of getting into a genetic counseling program. I am hoping to go to one of the schools (edit: USF) in Florida. I know both of these are new programs, so there are not many statistics out there.

I am graduating this spring with a B.S in cell and molecular biology. My overall GPA (at this time) is a 3.49, my university GPA is a 3.4 (I have some transfer hours from dual credit in high school). I have gotten some Cs- a C in Biology II (ridiculous, I know, but it was my first semester of college), a C in Cell Metabolism, and a C in molecular biology of the gene. I also have 2 Ws on my transcript, but received B+s in both after retaking. I have a fairly strong GPA for my ""supporting"" classes (chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, calculus) with As in all, and a B+ and B- for organic chemistry I and II respectively.  

I currently work at a cancer center, talking to patients on the phone in a cell center, so I do have experience with HIPPA practices and discussing issues with patients. I am planning on joining the crisis text hotline, I just need to get another recommendation (going to do that next week). I have not yet taken the GRE, will be doing that during my gap year. I also plan on shadowing very soon.

I feel as a whole, my GPA is not very strong, and the only ""unique"" aspect about my application will be that I work at a cancer center. Is there anyway to strengthen this? Would I maybe need to do a master's program first to become a better candidate?

"Thoughts on going into genetic counseling while not being a ""hard science"" person","Hi all! I am in my last year doing my BA in Sociology. I have taken pretty minimal science courses, given that I took AP Chem and Bio in high school and just had to take a few non-lab sciences when I got to college - I think I've only taken physical anthropology, a couple geology classes, and nutrition science. To be honest I've thought I wasn't a ""science"" person since elementary school despite doing pretty well in those classes, they just never came as easily to me as reading and writing and overall counted them as ""boring"". However, I have truly loved my medical sociology classes and am very fascinated with what I have studied about the social construction/aspects of genetics, medical research, and patient care despite not having taken life science courses in a while.

I am also a yoga teacher and teach a specific program offered in hospitals to patients with limited mobility, stress, chronic pain, depression, and insomnia (Urban Zen Integrative Therapy). I truly love teaching and practicing yoga, and have enjoyed what I've learned about anatomy and health through my studies as a yoga teacher (about 1,000 hours training). I really enjoy working with patients in the healthcare setting, in addition to working one on one with private students and teaching small classes and workshops. I've become really interested in recent studies about yoga and meditation and how they relate to the fields of epigenetics, neuroplasticity, and trauma.

My hesitancy is that I'm not sure if I'm really interested in all these things theoretically, and if there is a career that would better suit that rather than going into the field of genetics specifically? I know I will need to take a lot more science classes, and it feels like a big undertaking. I'm looking into shadowing someone near me soon and just recently joined my school's club for students interested in GC so I'm basically dipping my toes, doing a lot of research, and seeing how things might fit together.

My concern is that as a yoga teacher/someone interested in holistic health (although nothing crazy), will I look super ""woo woo"" or weird compared to other applicants? Just not sure how conservative the field is, and wondering if this would be something that could help set me apart or could possibly hinder me.

Advice for Genetic Counseling Assistant Position Interview,"Hey Everyone!

&#x200B;

I just received an interview invitation for an amazing full-time GCA position that I would absolutely love to be in and I could not be more excited to have this opportunity. I feel prepared to apply for genetic counseling programs this fall (my alternative plan), but I really wouldn't mind taking a couple more years to improve my GRE and gain some experience in the field. My undergrad major was non-science and I have essentially taken the main science prereqs since but not a whole lot more (though my GPA is excellent so hopefully that won't affect me too much). I am feeling a little under-prepared in that respect. I am hoping to compensate with a job that is in the field because honestly, paying for classes and working close to full-time without benefits is not really ideal. I also feel like programs have become so competitive that I would feel much more comfortable having this position on my application in a few years. Plus, it really can't hurt to have those kinds of contacts coming out of graduate school either.

&#x200B;

All that being said, do any GCs or former/current GCAs have any advice for the interview? It's a panel interview that's supposed to be mostly situational-type questions (questions like ""Think of a time when....What did you do? What was the outcome?""). Are there specific questions that are good to ask them at the end that might be specific to a GCA position? What might be some questions you would want to know that would help you gauge whether I might be a good fit for a position like this? What kinds of qualities/behaviors are you looking for in a GCA?

[Participation request] Precision medicine and genetic testing survey,"Hello /r/ClinicalGenetics!

I'm a doctoral candidate who is looking for participants in my survey. Part of my dissertation is exploring how prepared our health system is to work with the increasing amount of genetic data healthcare providers will be exposed to thanks to precision medicine. I need clinical geneticists, genetic counselors, physicians, and healthcare providers who might encounter patients asking for assistance with direct-to-consumer genetic tests (23andMe, etc.). I could really use your help! So here are the details:

* Are you 19 years or older?
* Hold a post-graduate or professional degree (i.e. MD, MS in genetic counseling, etc.)

If you answered YES to these questions, you may be eligible to participate in a national survey to determine how different medical professionals interpret genetic testing results.

The purpose of this study is to survey different groups of healthcare providers about their experiences, knowledge, and confidence in interpreting genetic test results with patients. The first aim of this study is to evaluate how different healthcare providers, with different levels of education on genetic test results, interpret selected information from genetic test results. The second aim is to determine the confidence and self-efficacy of healthcare providers as they interpret genetic test results with patients. The final aim is to capture healthcare providers’ opinions about, and experiences with, Direct-to-Consumer genetic tests.

This study is part of a dissertation for a doctorate in biomedical informatics and it is titled: Anticipating the Knowledge Gap within the Genomic Pillar of Precision Medicine. It is being conducted through the University of Nebraska at Omaha, 1110 S 67th St, Omaha, NE 68182.

Critique My Application,"Hey all! In gathering up my application materials, I came across a few parts of my application that I’m worried are weak enough to get me disqualified/rejected from most programs. My background:


Stronger/average points…

* Undergrad BS with a major in Diagnostic Genetic Sciences and a concentration in Cytogenetics

* 6 month rotation at a large Cytogenetics laboratory

* Almost 3 years of experience working in a smaller clinical Cytogenetics hospital laboratory, plenty of interaction with students/residents.

* Shadowing prenatal and oncology genetic counselors (ongoing over a period of a few months)

* GRE 157V/157Q

* Advanced genetic courses during my undergrad (cyto/molecular, case studies, ethic and genetics, etc.)

What I’m worried about…


* Undergrad GPA was a 3.1. Barely above the 3.0 minimum I’ve seen for most programs.

* I didn’t realize it until I looked at my transcript, but I had a C- in Human Genetics. *Cringe.* I took this class before my upper level genetic courses and managed to do better in those. I’m pretty sure that most of the material overlapped in my later courses, but is the C- something I should be worried about? Is this a big red flag? Sadly I’m not really in a position where I can retake it.

* My volunteer history has gaps and may not be what they’re looking for. In highschool I did some peer mentoring for 2 years and volunteered at a local summer camp. In college I mostly worked and didn’t really do much volunteer oriented work. I’ve been a listener on 7cups.com since September in hopes of boosting my application, but I’m not sure if this will be enough!


I’m really excited about the prospect of becoming a genetic counselor—I was first exposed to the idea during my undergrad but was iffy about it. After working in the field of clinical genetics for a few years and working with a few genetic counselors, I’m really sure that this is what I want to do! Please be honest and let me know if there is anything I can do to strengthen my app!

"Hello, I am wondering about the field of GC!","So a hospital and university partnered up to create a local GC program in the last few years and I was actually diagnosed with EDS not long ago so that's how I first got introduced to the fact that there are genetics counselors.

I have a BS in biology and dabbled in a variety of fields, and so far I don't feel like I have found a good career. I have so far ruled out nursing and medical lab science. Pretty sure I won't be going into MD as I don't deal with stress well, but it's still an option.

I am currently in pharmaceutical research and it is fine and all, but I have hit a ceiling where I either can go back to school, or will spend 7-10 years trying to ""level up"" so to speak in both pay and knowledge.

So I was curious if msGC might be a path for me. I know if likely really depends on your employer, but I do enjoy research and wonder if there are any research opportunities available or if that is more for academic geneticists, PhDs, etc.

What is the job outlook? I had considered pharmacy but it sounds like there are large saturation issues. 

What kind of salary growth is there? I hate to ask this, but the program I looked at would put me at least 50k in the hole without living expenses, and locally it seems the salary is around 55-65k. Seems pretty steep.

Monosomy X No Results (twice!) on NIPT — possible family history cause? ,"This is my second pregnancy, I did the NIPT test when I was pregnant with my first daughter and all came back low risk. She’s now a healthy 3 year old. 

Now during my second pregnancy with another girl, my NIPT came back low risk for everything but No Results due to insufficient sample quality the first time. LifeLabs suggested I retest so I did and this time I got No Results, atypical finding. NT scan/ultrasounds have looked unconcerning thus far. 

I have an appt booked with a genetic counsellor in a couple days and I understand the next steps will likely be an ultrasound and amnio. However my Q is— 

I was doing some reading and saw that a family history of blood relation between two parents somewhere down the line could cause an atypical reading for Monosomy X. My husband and I are certainly NOT related but MY parents are first cousins. (I’m from a country where this is not uncommon, not here for judgement. I understand the risks and why this is biologically not ideal etc.) 

I was wondering if that could be causing my No Results reading? I know this is not an uncommon NIPT result regardless so perhaps it’s just random, but just curious! And if so, would it not have also happened during my first pregnancy?

YTHDF3 gene deletion. Please help. ,"Hi All:  My wife is 5 1/2 months pregnant with a baby girl.  We just received the results from her microarray test saying that our baby has a deletion of the YTHDF3 gene.  The only literature I can find (or for that matter our doctors can find) is one study published February 2022 in Denmark that evaluated 4 subjects with the same deletion.  All 4 subjects had neurodevelopmental delays of variable degrees and it was suggested by the authors that the cause was the same YTHDF3 gene deletion.

On the one hand, it is just 4 subjects from 2 1/2 years ago, but on the other hand I can not find one example of a healthy person with the same YTHDF3 gene deletion.  It would help a lot to know that it is possible to have the deletion of that gene and still have a healthy baby, but there is simply nothing that my doctors or myself can point to.

We are obviously extremely concerned for our baby, and our doctors are actually feeling quite concerned about the outcome as well if it turns out to be a de novo deletion (my wife and I both gave blood and are awaiting the results to determine that).

I have added a link to the original study from Denmark.  

Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks so much.

Large Deletion on Q arm of X chromosome ,"Hi, my husband and I just got results from an amniocentesis and found out our little girl has a 15 mb deletion on the Q arm of one of her X chromosomes. She also has a duplication on that same chromosome. The other X is completely typical. We are concerned because the deletion involves the gene MECP2 that when deleted/mutated, usually results in Rett Syndrome. 

We are wondering if there is any information out there regarding what to expect with a deletion of this size and if our concern about Rett Syndrome is warranted. We have been searching through tons of studies and can’t seem to find any cases with a deletion of this size.

Edit: We have already met with a genetic counselor and that meeting has brought up these questions. She has not seen a case like ours before and therefore did not have any similar cases or studies that we could relate our situation to.

EDIT: Microarray results:

10.63 MB Interstitial Duplication of XQ26.1->Q27.1

Uniparental disomy (UPD) of Entire Chromosome 2,"Our baby was diagnosed with a Uniparental Isodisomy of Chromosome 2 via a chromosomal microarray analysis through amniocentesis. We have heard mixed information on if the baby can still be healthy. This diagnosis seems to be quite rare in general and even more rare on chromosome 2.

The 2 biggest concerns with UPD seem to be a larger likelihood of recessive disorders and issues with genomic imprinting. Some literature says that there is no known clinical impact for UPD on chromosome 2, but numerous case studies seem to oppose that.

I am currently doing a postdoc in the genetics field, but there were some unexpected problems with the funding, and my funding will run out by the beginning of fall. 


My PhD is in molecular biology, not genetics, but my research focused on cancer genomics and genetics. I also have a strong programming background, but not a ton of wet lab research experience. I am worried that will hurt me as a lot of the LGG curriculum seems to focus on wet lab techniques. 


I would deeply appreciate any advice or ideas on how to strengthen my application. What type of jobs should I apply for? Is there anyone here who has successfully applied for an LGG fellowship? Thanks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/1cgz879/looking_for_lgg_fellowship_advice/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9979352951049805

Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) after Carrier Testing,"Dear all

I have gone through the comprehensive carrier testing from Invitae.

My partner is the kind who prefers having all knowledge available so when my doctor offered us whole genome sequencing (WGS), he wanted to do it. After we discussed, I said yes to doing it too.

A big motivation for us doing the WGS test is that the doctor had kindly signed us up as research participants in a genetic study he was doing, so the WGS test, that would otherwise cost about $5,100 for us, is free. More information at no monetary cost seemed like a good deal for my partner who is a little health-anxious. Upon discussion, I understood where he was coming from and decided to go ahead with it too.

However, I am so anxious about the results. Because it is done via a research study, the results will take about 4-5 months to come back. Doing the Invitae test for 560+ genes was already so scary for me, so this WGS where all 20,000 genes are tested is so scary.

Is there an associated mutation / disease for every of the 20,000 genes?

How does a WGS report look like? What information do we get from it? 

Is there a chance we will not be carriers for anything? 

Is there a chance we will not be carriers of the same thing?

I guess I am just looking for comfort and support as I go through this waiting period. Any and all experience would help, or perhaps a kind word. If you have done WGS or carrier testing etc, please feel free to comment or even DM.

Thank you for reading!

Awaiting amnio results for trisomy 8,"Hi everyone, we were flagged as high risk for NIPT due to an extra chorosome 8. Currently awaiting amnio results.

What if the chorosome abnormality is in the brain or other organs? How would that even get picked up in an amnio?

Concerned about genetic implications for my kids due to intermarriage in the Mennonite communities,"I was in an arranged marriage when I was very young. We both came from German Mennonite backgrounds. We are third cousins, which, even when I was young and naive, made me uncomfortable. I later found out, 4 kids later, that my ex husband’s grandparents are second cousins. I’m currently studying in a medical field and have been fascinated by genetics. However, the more I learn, the more I’m concerned for my children. 

I talked to my father and found out that his paternal grandparents are also some sort of distant cousin. I’m sure there’s more relational overlap on my ex husband’s side, as well, since all the Mennonites tend to live in small, isolated communities and marry each other. 

As far as I can tell, my ex and 3 of my children all have low muscle tone, as indicated by the pediatrician. One of my children has scoliosis, like her dad. The father has a lot of sensory and social issues consistent with asd, though he’s never been diagnosed. One of my children was born with a low lying ear.

Hypophosphatasia,"Hi. I had an appointment with a geneticist recently (it was actually a team of providers) because i am being evaluated for Hypophosphatasia. I have a classic clinical presentation of childhood Hypophosphatasia, labs, diagnostic imaging, my own medical history along with family history say all signs point to HPP. They did not diagnose me that day, as they said they were going to re-evaluate the whole exome testing i had done. They said with whole exome testing, because there is so much to look at they usually only focus on what symptoms the doctor orders the test for & since the ordering doctor didn’t put anything regarding signs of HPP, the geneticist said it wouldn’t have been reported on my summary. 
They then told me if they don’t find a pathogenic variant, they are going to reach out to some rare disease research group because they have more tools at their disposal than clinical does.

"Commentary on some allele frequency maps from the 2018 paper: Genomic Analyses from Non-invasive Prenatal Testing Reveal Genetic Associations, Patterns of Viral Infections, and Chinese Population History","Hi there, I'm an amateur follower of human population genetics and pop anthropology in general. My interest stems from curiosity about my own DNA/ancestry and how it compare to other Chinese Americans, and a general interest in the life sciences (which I majored in in undergrad). I made this account so I could talk about East Asian and East Eurasian population genetics and DNA ancestry test results on Reddit.

There was an interesting article on Han Chinese population genetics released in Oct 2018, based on low-pass, noninvasive prenatal testing samples from various women who were Chinese nationals. DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.08.016, [link to the paper](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2818%2931032-8)

&nbsp;
 
I initially focused on the autosomal genetics findings of this paper comparing Han Chinese to other East Asians, which were expressed in terms of allele sharing with certain reference populations. Saw the paper referenced again in [an online blog post](https://www.quora.com/Do-the-Uyghurs-and-Han-Chinese-in-China-have-different-facial-features/answer/Feng-Jiaxin-1) which made me more curious about the clinically significant alleles covered in the paper. 

My comments down below are framed in the context of autosomal genetic variation among Han Chinese and within China, which is mostly on a north-south axis and is greater within the rice-growing southern half of the country than the wheat-growing northern half.

&nbsp;
   
B = [CR1 loci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_receptor_1) (immune system). Derived allele more common in the south, especially away from the Yangtze Delta.

C = [FADS2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FADS2) (fatty acid metabolism). Derived allele allegedly linked to increased intelligence in breast-fed babies in some studies but has not been replicated (i.e. probably not real). More common in the north, then the Yangtze basin, then the South China Sea coast.

D = [ELK2AP-MIR4507](https://www.ecosia.org/search?q=ELK2AP-MIR4507%20IGH%20gene%20cluster) (cancer related?) Derived allele more common in the north, but the north-south transition in frequency occurs further north

E = [ABCC11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC11) (earwax/body odor, this one is more commonly known). Derived allele = dry earwax, north-south frequency transition occurs further south than C such that it's basically Guangxi vs everywhere else

F = [DOCK9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dock9) ([mutations of this have been connected to bipolar disorder](https://zenodo.org/record/1234913)). Derived allele is most common in Guangxi, less common in the north, and much rarer in Qinghai than the rest of the north. [I find it interesting that this gene was selected for in southern Chinese](https://www.nature.com/articles/ejhg2011139). I wonder if this is in any way related to stereotypes of southern Chinese being less ""direct"" and more group-oriented than northern Chinese, which is arguably more of a hallmark of rice culture vs wheat culture. 

G = [LILRA3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LILRA3) (immune system). 

&nbsp;
   
The rest of the ones were said to have stronger north-south regional differences

&nbsp;

H = [Meckle syndrome (type 2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meckel%E2%80%93Gruber_syndrome). Lethal rare genetic disease. Derived allele concentrated in Gansu and Hainan, but also Guangdong, Fujian, and Jilin

I = [Complement component 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_component_9) (immune system). Derived allele has uniform frequency across most of China proper, but more common in Guangxi, Guangdong, Shanghai, and Liaoning

J = Deafness. Most common in Guangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Hunan. Relatively rare in Hainan, Guizhou, and the north.

K = [Aceruloplasminemia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aceruloplasminemia) (copper deficiency in brain, causes adult neurological problems). Derived allele most common in the inland north, also somewhat common in Hainan and Yungui (Yunnan + Guizhou)

L = [Usher syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usher_syndrome) (deafblindness). Derived allele more common in south than north, most common in Hainan, also more common in Xinjiang

M = Albinism (red pigmentation). Derived allele map is basically a map of West Eurasian admixture among Han Chinese lol (Qinghai, Gansu, Shanxi most frequent, much less common in the coastal north and nonexistent south of the Qinling-Huaihe line)

N = non-syndromic genetic deafness. Derived allele is more common everywhere in the south than anywhere in the north, but more common in Shaanxi, Beijing, and Liaoning than other parts of the north. 

O = [G6PD CANTON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucose-6-phosphate_dehydrogenase_deficiency) (ELI5- metabolism issue, can't eat fava beans). This variant is most common in Shanxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and to a lesser extent Fujian- but not Hainan, and is rare elsewhere.

Chromosome 3 deletion in Cytoband 13p to 12.3 advice/help,"Hi I’m new here, we recently had our first daughter and everything was normal until we gave birth. She was born at 5lbs 4oz and had trouble gaining weight. She has bad reflux and was put on medication. She then refused the bottle so they admitted her to the hospital and installed an NG tube. We spent a week there and they ordered a genomic microarray analysis. The results were a deletion of chromosome 3p13p12.3 the size of the deletion is 5634.527 kpb. They said this is quite rare and we cannot find much if anything online. We are hoping to meet with a genetic counsellor in a month or so. Our question is what does that deletion mean for our daughter? The paper says it could be associated with neurodevelopmental delay, failure-to-thrive, growth retardation and dysmorphic facial features. Just by looking at her she looks like a normal healthy 14 week old with no dysmorphic features, she does have low tone in her neck, but kicks and moves her arms around like crazy. So how large is the 3p13p12.3 region in total size (kbp) and as a percentage how much does a5635kbp deletion represent? 

Any info or advice is greatly appreciated.

Two Sets of Balanced Translocations?,"Hi, does anyone else out there have two sets of balanced translocations or know of such a case?  I do - one set inherited from my Dad and one set from my Mom - and would love to find someone else, ideally female like me, to compare notes on fertility and experience with IVF.  I’ve used two different clinics/doctors and am about to start my sixth round of IVF but still feel very much in the dark on whether this process is beneficial because no one seems to have much experience with someone with two sets of translocations.  I’ve gotten very different assessments of scientific odds from different genetic counselors, which leads me to want anecdotal advise.

Lynch Syndrome Result & Cancer,"Hi! I'm not sure how simple or complex my question might be. I'm pretty familiar with oncogenic driver mutations in ctDNA thanks to many Guardant360 blood biopsies for my mom who recently passed. None of her biomarkers were germline, all somatic under 10% (including tp53). I used her raw data from 23andme that I uploaded to Promethease along with mine. I was surprised to see hers came back with Lynch Syndrome.

# If my mom did her 23andme test while in cancer treatment, could it have affected this result?

&amp;gt;*History*  
*Age 45: Stage IV transformed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Remission; remained in bone marrow (unclear on this).*  
*Age 59: Lymphoma returned with Stage IV EGFR+ Lung Adenocarcinoma. Never smoker. Passed at 62.*  
*Of note: these cancers aren't known to be associated with Lynch Syndrome. However, her younger brother did pass at 45 from colon cancer. That extended family does have a high prevalence of cancers.*

They both left 2 children and have 3 remaining siblings who all have children. I did not have this mutation. How likely is a miscall, or even what is a miscall? Thank you to anyone who reads this!

PhD vs MS in Genetic Counseling,"Hello, I am a current college student who has been planning on applying to a genetics/bioinformatics type of PhD program in the future. I have always had an interest in the biological sciences and research, and so far I have been enjoying my experience as an undergraduate research assistant in a genomics lab.

I happened to come across the subject of genetic counseling by chance on the internet, and was really intrigued to look more into it. I had never heard of this occupation before! Not only did the clinical aspect of it sound interesting, but I saw that there seemed to be a lot of unique positions for genetic counselors in government and industry. I feel that my dream job would ideally involve research as that is what has motivated me to pursue a career in the sciences!

Perhaps I am jumping the gun here, but reading up on the profession made me stop and think about what a possible career as a genetic counselor would be like. Of course, I really ought to reach out and attempt to shadow/conduct an informational interview to gain a better understanding of what this field is about... but I thought I would make a post here to see if anyone had some insight :)

My main question is how common is it for those in the genetic counseling profession to have a career centered around research? Is it unrealistic to expect to be able to engage with research at the same level as someone with a PhD in genetics or bioinformatics?

GC 2021 Applicant - GRE Scores Optional??,"Hey y'all,

I don't know if folks tend to post things on here, but wondering if I can get some advice re: whether I should submit my GRE scores to some programs. A few have made them optional given the pandemic! Usually I'm not a fan of doing these kinds of posts but it's a weird time to navigate applying for grad school.

Quick bio: I was a medical anthro major in undergrad and a non-traditional student (I have kind of a circuitous path in and out of school that I will plan to discuss in my applications). Did premed prereqs, my GPA isn't calculated by the college I attended (I went to a school that does written evaluations instead of grades, but I have graded coursework from schools we have an inter-exchange agreement with - my science grades were a mix of As, A-s, B+s, and one B in biochem). I took a genetic counseling seminar this spring once I realized I wanted to go into this field, and I've been active in research through my undergrad experience. I have a lot of informational interviewing (trying to arrange shadowing, but it's hard with the pandemic and remote working) and I have been working on a harm reduction crisis hotline for the past 6 months. I also worked as a doula on and off since 2014.

I took the GRE and did okay by my standards - testing is hard for me and when practicing I was testing in the 35th percentile for quant. But my final scores were 155 Q/159V (55th percentile and 82nd percentile, respectively) and a 5 on the writing. I wish my verbal was higher but imo they are ""good enough."" After I took the test, half of the 6 programs I'm applying to said that the GRE is optional and to submit it if you think that it'll enhance your application. If it matters- I'm specifically debating whether to submit these scores to the Hopkins/NIH GCTP program, and University of Maryland. I'm wondering if these scores are ""good enough"" to share as part of my application. I know y'all can't really give a definitive answer, but any insight would be appreciated :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/hysu5k/gc_2021_applicant_gre_scores_optional/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9801971912384033

Gap year plans for genetic counseling apps?,"Hi all,

I'm planning on applying for genetic counseling programs this cycle and am trying to figure out the best way to boost my application. I graduated this May (2020) with a BS in Neuroscience with a minor in Psychology, 3.8 GPA (Mostly A- or B+ in my science classes with no Cs). I've had 2.5 years of undergrad research experience with a project that I started from scratch and presented at multiple conferences (the project focused on gene expression so it was genetics heavy). Additionally, I was a TA for a Microbiology class, was a charter member and treasurer for AXE chemistry fraternity, president of my school's Neuroscience club, and was the lead recruitment counselor for my school's sorority rush process for 2 years (a little cheesy, I know but those girls can get really emotional so it was pretty good counseling practice). I graduated with honors and won the departmental biology award for tutoring and mentorship.

For work and advocacy experience I worked 3 months at a plasma donation center as a sample processor and I recently got a job at a large lab company as a technologist. I also currently have a job with an autism society where I mentor participants and help them achieve short and long term goals (it had around 20 hours of training as a part of the on boarding process) which I have been doing since March. There are also a few sorority philanthropy events I could include if necessary, we were partnered with a local family services center.

COVID kind of messed up my shadowing plans but I have had 9 phone interviews with genetic counselors and plan on watching any video sessions that schools have on their websites for more exposure (so far I've found 6).

I haven't taken the GRE yet, English is my best subject and Math is my worst so I'm a little worried about that but I have a math tutor and plan on studying a ton before I take it in a month and a half or so.

Given all of my experiences does it seem like I would have a chance at getting into a program? I'm from the south and am hoping to stay on the east coast so any suggestions of programs that seem like they would be a good fit would be great suggestions as well as any experiences that I should have before applying. My state of residency (TN) has no state programs so lower cost programs are ideal or ones with scholarships. I know I have minimal crisis counseling experience but with a full time and part time job on top of studying for the GRE I just don't know if I'll have the time, would that be a deal breaker?

Thank you so so much for literally any advice, the more GCs I interview the more perfect this career seems for me so I just want to make sure I'm doing everything I can!

I am so anxious,"Hey guys, its 12:30 am and this isnt really anything but a vent post.

I am a sophomore biology major. Genetic counseling is my dream career, and I say that as someone who has switched my major 2 times. I feel like the stars are aligning and I'm checking off all the boxes: I have research experience, counseling experience, advocacy experience, teaching experience, multiple informational interviews, shadowing, leadership conferences. My GPA is also decent.

This semester is a hard one because I am taking physics, which I suck at, and no biology courses because of some prereq issues. But ive just been so anxious and feeling down because I'm actually doing alright at physics (B range, which is good for me), but the class thats really kicking my butt? Gen Chem 2! How am I supposed to be a science major and take orgo and biochem and go to grad school if I can barely handle gen chem 2?

Ive always preferred the psychosocial stuff over the hard science stuff, but ive never been outright bad at science. I feel so anxious because I went through high school/early college without ambition, and after finding out about genetic counseling, it is the first time in my life I have actually wanted something.

I'm not a competitive applicant at the moment for GC school, so I've been working toward my license in a clinical lab.

To be honest, one of the biggest drivers for considering immunogenetics is that I hope to one day apply to GC school. Right now I feel like my chances aren't good enough to risk the cost of the application cycle, but maybe once I'm more financially secure I could rationalize the attempt.

A lingering question... where is the field heading?,"Over the past few years there has been a lot of hype in genomics / DTC genetic tests thanks to dropping price and large-scale government efforts. And yet the merits of these tests (whether array or sequencing based)  have been challenged repeatedly.

Beyond the low hanging fruit mendelian diseases, most form of cancer cannot be trace to simple genetic cause (I believe it was something like less than 10% of them). I believe most experts right now would say that there is not enough support for pushing population screening because the causation of the disease is not established and probably wouldn't be (because it's not inherited). So if we can't really establish the relationship between those handful of genes and disease (ie health testing), is there any justification to the hype besides learning about your ancestry (Israel and Mormons community for example)? or am I missing something?

Have you heard of any conditions with these features? (Trying to prep for son’s next ENT appt & next steps),"Hey there! My son is 3 years old, and he’s had some random and generally minor health concerns his entire life. The main one is a laryngeal cleft that causes aspiration, and this is why he sees an ENT. I’m trying to figure out if there could be some underlying cause to all of this... does anyone know of a condition which could include these features?

* laryngeal cleft (type 1)

* very high palate

* low tone/weak torso— he slouches constantly & needed ankle braces and PT for almost a year 

* hypermobility (for instance, he can do a straddle split without trying)

* somewhat wide ribcage— almost looks like a barrel chest (his pediatrician mentioned this too)

* Used to have weakness and limited mobility on his left side, but this has improved over time. MRI showed a slight something that may have been an artifact on the globus pallidum— said it was probably not of clinical significance

* Used to have difficulty speaking/pronouncing sounds (more so than what is expected developmentally) but this has also improved

Although he took his time on some developmental milestones, at this age he is of normal to above-average intelligence and has a very cheerful and social disposition overall. Physically, you wouldn’t notice anything different unless you’re looking for it... but I’m still trying to connect the dots.

Re-connecting with research participants in the event of new info on their genetic information.,"New guidelines published on re-connecting with research participants should their genetic information should be interpreted differently, e.g. disease-linked genetic variants or other be later identified.

&#x200B;

To sum:

>the Workgroup recommended that there is a strong responsibility for researchers to attempt to recontact participants to offer updated results. If the reinterpretation is not expected to affect medical management, recontact is advised rather than strongly recommended.  
>  
>\[...\] there is no responsibility for researchers to hunt or scan the genomic literature for changes in variant interpretation, and that any responsibility to recontact should be limited to the duration of research funding. Additional recommendations address the practicalities of informed consent, involvement of institutional review boards, timeliness and protocol of recontact, and structuring of future research studies.

I haven’t taken the GRE yet but I have begun prepping with prep books & will be taking it soon. 

Last summer, I did a genetic counseling internship at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh. It was a total of 300 hours (150 being in clinic with the gcs & shadowing, 150 working on projects for the department). Also I will be shadowing with a cancer gc next week & I have a couple informational interviews set up. I have connected with the BU grad program—I attended their seminar class last semester as a guest a few times and have gotten to know the program director (she even wrote me a letter of rec for the IIHG gc internship this summer and is keeping me updated on the summer internship BMC is putting together). So hopefully, I’ll be doing another GC internship this summer or something related. Additionally, I am wanting to do at least the University of Cincinnati GC online case series class. And, of course, any open house or info presentation or career day related to genetic counseling that I can get to, I do. 

I am a crisis counselor for Crisis Text Line & I don’t have the most amount of hours yet but I’m planning on doing a lot more over the summer when I have more time. Beyond doing this just for checking a box, I really have enjoyed it and am glad I’m doing it. I also am trying to make my schedule work with ACEing Autism in Boston where I would get to volunteer and help kids with autism learn how to play tennis. I’m really hoping this works out because I love tennis & teaching people tennis & I think I will really enjoy it. 

I will also be getting a bit of genetics specific lab experience in the fall semester when I take Genetics Lab as a class where we work on experiments and research in the lab every week.  

What are my chances? Are there certain areas you think I should focus on more and improve/get more experience with? 

Thanks!!

How are you supposed to start work in the UK?,"The whole process is unintelligible and I don't know who else to ask. 

So the first role in a genetics laboratory would be genetic technologist. 

To be a genetic technologist you must be registered with the AHCS (Academy of Healthcare Science)...
To register with the AHCS you need at least a certificate of competence. To get that is a rabbit hole in its own that I can't seem to find my way out of.

How do you start!?!?!??!?!

Help interpreting karotype results— mosaic or not?,"I want to preface this by saying we do have an appointment with a geneticist at a specialty clinic to get more information, but they were booked out until June.

Our “cytogenetic results” state: 47XXY.

Our “cytogenetic data” states:
Metaphases counted: 22
Metaphases analyzed: 11
Metaphases karyogrammed: 6

There was a note stating that the result was “5 metaphases with 47XXY karyotype”. 

My question is, does this mean 5 out of the 22 metaphases counted? 5 out of 11? 5 out of 6? If it was 5 out of 22, does that indicate mosiacism?

How much chemistry do GCs use on a daily basis?,"Hey all,

I have a BS in health education and I've been contemplating genetic counseling as a career for some time now. I have about 2 years of counseling experience through rape crisis centers and HIV clinics, and I get tremendous satisfaction from providing educational and emotional support. I think I'm very well-suited to this field, except for one glaring issue... I haven't taken a chemistry class since high school, and when I DID take it I struggled painfully for a C+ grade.

Algebraic maths & sciences are not my strong suit (I did just fine in geometry, stats, human biology, etc), and while I'm totally willing to buckle down and pass the necessary chemistry prerequisites to qualify for entry into a GC program... I don't think I'd be happy if I had to do chemical equations on a daily basis for 30+ years.

So my question to counselors and GC grad students is: How much chemistry is \*actually\* involved in your job? And would it be unwise for someone who struggles with chemistry to pursue this field?

"Can you become a genetic counselor without a masters in genetic counseling, but a PhD in genetics + previous faculty position at a medical school?","I'm asking this question on behalf of a relative:

They don't have a masters in genetic counseling, but they do have a PhD in genetics and was faculty at a top 40 research/top 10 primary care medical school. The problem is that they haven't been working directly in medicine/genetics for a long time (probably a couple decades) - this person left the university to start a company (pharma), and has worked in industry ever since.

Would it be possible for a person like this to become an ABGC Certified Genetic Counselor? And can you start a private practice as a genetic counselor, or do you have to practice through a traditional hospital/medical school/medical provider (i.e. Sutter, Kaiser, etc.)?

Apologizes if any part of my question sounds ignorant - I myself am in the humanities, so this is very unfamiliar territory...

Nurse to GC?," Hi everyone. I'm about to start my first semester of my ADN program next month. I have a health problem, and its causes me problems sometimes with flare ups...and its still relatively poorly understood, so there aren't any effective medications or treatments for it yet. Thankfully it is mild in comparison to the horror stories I've read online...I'm able to function, I just struggle with overwhelming fatigue,pain, etc.  


I dont know how long I'd be able to handle bedside nursing because it is very physically demanding, even for healthy people. So, I'm trying to plan for my future in the event that I will not be able to work bedside as a nurse doing 12 hours shifts. I've been looking into getting my masters in Genetic Counseling after I get my ADN and BSN, but im wondering if it is possible for me to become a nurse practitioner and specialize in genetics, similar to something that a genetic counselor would do/be? I'm hesitant because a lot of people are going down the route of becoming a NP, and I've been reading that this can negatively impact the salaries of NP...Adding to that, genetic counseling sounds fascinating and I think it'd be a fulfilling career for me.   


Im reading about whether or not a BSN would be an acceptable undergraduate degree prior to applying to Genetic Counselor programs (and I've emailed one school in my state so far), and I'm starting a nursing program next month so a part of me feels as if I should go through with it (and im excited! I've always wanted to be a nurse...just dont know if I'll be able to physically handle it after a while)or if I should switch my major and get a Bachelors in some other science field like biology, chem, genetics, etc..

On becoming a medical geneticist?,"Hello there, 

I want to ask you guys about this branch of medicine. I found it quite recently and there seems to be quite a little info about it. Most of the information I found was here in years old threads, so I decided that hopefully, I can get some new perspectives and insights.

My first question obviously is if this is still a thing if I can be interested in Medical Genetics and find a job in a 10 years span. (If I can do it all). 

My second question is quite obvious too, which route is the best one. In those threads, I mentioned I found some possibilities to be.

Pediatrics - Neonatal - Geneticist
IM/Genetics combined 
Pediatrics/Genetics combined
Ob/Gyn + Genetics combined

Is this still a thing or has something changed? Any route better than a previous, I mean competence wise, length is not a problem for me. 

My third question is really more like the need for confirmation. 

Most of the people on the internet mentioned that Genetics is a field that has everything that's for me interesting. It combines detective work because each genetic patient is unique. It combines that I would most likely know my patients for quite some time because it isn't something that can be done in a span of weeks. You get to treat, or take care of and diagnose, NICU patients (I am no weirdo or creep but there is something incredibly rewarding and interesting on treating (anyhow helping) those who cannot do anything themselves. There is some hero factor in it). You get to see cancer (which is also very interesting). And there is always a room for research. 
Basically, I think it is very challenging, not repeating (kinda allergic to boredom... repetitiveness) specialty that needs some scientific proficiency. 

this is what I find interesting from what I know or thing, can you please tell me if I am wrong somewhere or if there's, even more, I can do? 

My last question is just out of curiosity. I understand that what I am asking is hardly possible and even if it is possible it would be incredibly hard but I am gonna ask anyway  

Naturally, Genetics isn't the only thing I am interested in, but it seems that my Interest generally is in human body disorders. Genetics, Immunology, and Endocrinology are what interests me most (besides Cancer). So basically my question is if those areas can be somehow combined in one practice. I feel like it is somehow connected but I am not sure if one man can do more than one of those (or maybe all of them.) But as I said this is more out of curiosity than anything else because that's how I see it now.

Anyway, thank you guys who have red it all the way here. It means a lot to me.. Thank you in advance for any insight.

ps. Someone back then (this time on old Reddit post) mentioned that there are/were many branches of genetics (Lysosomal Disorders, Cancer Genetics, Cardiovascular Congenital Disorders etc.) so I wondered if you like, have to choose one and dive deep into that or if you can, like, switch between them, or meet patients with every type of disorder and not just the one you are deep into.  

There is so much more I would like to know so if anyone knows the answers and is willing to guide me trough my ""research"" about this awesome speciality I would be so glad.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/7voxmi/on_becoming_a_medical_geneticist/,ClinicalGenetics,0.956362783908844

How does variant classification (from benign to definitely pathogenic) work in the context of autosomal recessive disorders?,"Hello everyone. I am familiar with the variant classification criteria proposed by the ACMG and other medical organizations, but I don't quite understand how this is translated into the context of autosomal recessive disorders. In particular, technically speaking, does stating that a specific variant is, say, definitely pathogenic, mean that:

a) the variant in a homozygous state  is known to always cause the disease;

b) the variant in a heterozygous state with other functionally similar (e.g. identical-by-state) variant is known to always cause the disease;

or

c) the variant in a heterozygous state with other definitely pathogenic variants (even if functionally non-identical) is known to always cause the disease?

Thanks a lot in advance for helping me in clarifying this!

How can a genetic counsellor help us (as patients?),"Hi, we have a child with multiple health problems (not getting into this, because of the policy here about medical advice and the question is more general in any case). The neurologist sent us to a genetic test, that determined the child has a microduplication of a certain part of a certain gene . I am not a scientist, but I did my Google (and also read the letter the lab sent us), and a lot of people with the microduplication have certain things that the child probably has . The neurologist wants us to go to genetic counselling and I wonder, why is it actually good/important? 

We are not sure we want more kids, but let's say that having the risk of this multiduplication is not a reason not to (assuming it is hereditary, they say it may or may not be) 

Knowing what the child has does not really help us with treating these problems in the every day life (e.g. like drugs or paramedical therapy). It is not as if you can manipulate the child's DNA to become ""better"", right?

How to experimentally differentiate between haploinsufficiency and dominant negative effects?,"Wondering about your thoughts on how to best distinguish between haploinsufficiency and dominant negative mechanisms through laboratory experiments. Haploinsufficiency would mean that there is less protein product so less protein complexes are formed but they are still functional. Dominant negative would either mean that the complexes don't form or there is less catalytic activity because the mutant protein is interfering with wild-type function. So would measuring the amount of protein complexes and activity differentiate between the two mechanisms?

My fiancee really wants to pursue Genetic Counseling but has been rejected for the 2nd year in a row.,"So I apologize if this isn't the proper place to look for advice on this situation. I'm just looking for some advice on behalf of my fiancee. This will be the 2nd year in a row she has applied for Genetic Counseling programs at 3 different Universities. The 1st year she figured her GRE scores weren't good enough so she really tried focusing on that her 2nd time around. She also tried bolstering her application by pursuing a Masters in Biology at the same time. Part of what has her disheartened at this point is that she didn't get any interviews with the Schools she applied to, which makes her feel like she's not really *closer* this time than she was last time.

* One of the questions that I have is whether or not her application will be weaker if she waits a full school year before applying again? She really only had about 3-4 months after Graduating with a B.S in Bio-medical Sciences before she put all her attention towards getting into a program. She has been working full time to support herself while attending school, studying for the GRE and occasionally shadowing since then. I want to suggest to her to take some time after she graduates from her Masters program this Summer to relax, figure out her next step and let her know that I'm more than willing to support both of us if she wants to try and focus even more on getting in.

* The second question I have is whether or not it is possible to have her applications evaluated to see if, even though she technically meets the requirements of the program, she's actually competitive versus the average applicant? I want to help her make sure that it's not just a ""wrong time and place"" scenario keeping her out before she starts pursuing a Plan B for her career.

Genetic counsellor - perception,"Hi guys,

I'm not too sure where to begin, but I've applied for a genetic counselling program (and waiting to hear from them). The thing is, my family have been relentlessly mocking me because they view it as a ""feminine"" career. 

I love the idea of this profession, I want to interact with people on a more personal basis, and I feel that other careers won't necessarily afford that to me. So, I guess, seeing as there are people in the profession, does my sex matter? Would I be teased by colleagues/patients etc.. for being a male?

GCs -- how do you work with patients with rare genetic conditions?,"x post from /r/genetics

hi all -- I also asked this question of /u/SJHelix (who is a cancer genetic counselor and has hosted a couple of AMAs) but thought I would post it here as well.
I have Von Hippel Lindau (a rare genetic condition, autosomal dominant). I've lived with the condition for 15+ years, but still have many day to day questions. I'm considering options for having kids, pre implantation genetic diagnosis, etc.


I mostly interact with surgeons (for tumor removal), but am not sure who to ask other questions to and find the patient forums to be emotionally helpful but lacking expert opinions.



**GCs**....do you view your role as helping people with genetic conditions generally navigate their conditions / ""life questions""? Or do you primarily help with initial testing / diagnosis and then hand off the patient to another physician?
Also, do you ever connect with patients via email, skype, text etc? I am a technologist as well and was thinking of ways I could connect vhl patients with genetic counselors. I know there are a lot of unanswered questions based on the types of things people post on social media, especially Facebook.

**Patients / family members** ...would love any of your thoughts too! How have you worked with your GC and has it been helpful? thanks :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/3g1u0o/gcs_how_do_you_work_with_patients_with_rare/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9928066730499268

I am just about to finish my PhD in molecular genetics (in the UK). I regret a little not going into genetic counselling, but after a 4 year undergraduate, 1 year MSc and 4 year PhD (ie: 9 years!!) I am currently not keen to start another MsC - both for money and just mentality reasons.

Medical Genetics VS Human Reproduction MSc?,"
Hey y'all! I need some serious help by expert or someone who's been through this situation because my mind is about to blow! So I got a BSc in Molecular Biology and Genetics and I got accepted to two different MSc. One is in Greece and it's about Human Reproduction and the other one is in Scotland and it's about Medical Genetics and Genomics. My goal was to become a Genetic Counselor, however the idea of being an embryologist/IVF technician as well as being a medical genetist both are highly appealing to me. However, I wanted to eventually find a job in New York and I am not sure which one pays better. Additionally, I don't know whether Students from the United Kingdom are more acceptable to job positions in the USA than the one who gave a MSc from Greece. Anyone who can help out?

I’ve got 8 weeks left in this pregnancy and am driving myself mad with this news. 

She said SD doesn’t seem likely to her since the chest and other profiles look good.

T21 low level mosaicism?,"Hi everyone! 
A few days ago I received devastating news - possible low level mosaicism for T21. Why possible? Because Fish found only 4% of T21 cells in the amniotic fluid and according to the lab norms 5% is the level to confirm bad results. Unfortunately they didn't do a classic karyotype :( genetic specialists argue about such results - one says it's mosaicism for sure and others say it could be placenta confined. But this was amnio not CVS so really? Could it be placenta related? I'm on the verge of a total breakdown, I'm on meds to somehow get up every morning. This was a wanted baby, conceived after such a long time via IVF. My AMH is 0,28 and I have adenomyosis so I really wonder if I ever will be pregnant again ;(;( I would 100% terminate if this is mosaicism but doctors argue and give us hope. I'm already 18+4 so I feel him kicking and it breaks my heart. Is there really a chance that this is placenta and not a baby? I feel like terminating without certainty will eventually take a toll on me ;(",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/1e270l9/t21_low_level_mosaicism/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9965797066688538

Genetic Counsellor Questions,"Hey all! I recently graduated with my BSc(Hons) with a focus in molecular biology and biochemistry. I have four years of research experience, and have held teaching positions in my department. The plan has always been to go to grad school and stay in academia - I love research and teaching. I’ve always had an interest in health sciences (been the focus of my research), but have gotten turned off from working in academia. 

Long story short, I’ve been looking into completing a MSc and then do a MGC. I’m wondering if there are any medical geneticists or genetic counsellors that would be willing to give a brief synopsis of their role? Do you get to work in the lab? Is it largely patient interactions? Are you able to participate in research? Etc.

False negative Trisomy 13 or something similar? ,"Not sure if this is the right/best place to post this but figured it was worth a shot. I recently had a miscarriage at 18 weeks. Ultrasounds leading up to the loss showed a ruptured Omphalocele/gastroschisis (doctor was unable to determine definitively which one it was), a cleft palate, and suspected cardiac defect. We pursued genetic testing via CVS around 11 weeks. Karyotype came back normal. Microarray came back with a XQ28 deletion. Our genetic counselor said that this deletion isn’t typically associated with the defects seen on my ultrasound or fetal demise. She said that the defects are often seen with trisomy 13; however, since karyotype and NIPT came back fine, it’s highly unlikely that baby had T13. My question is, does anyone know of any other syndromes that present similarly to trisomy 13?  Also what are the chances of both the NIPT and Karyotype giving a false negative? My counselor said it was very unlikely. We also pursued whole genome testing but have not received the results yet. Although the chances are slim, we are hoping this final test will give us an answer.

Is it important which genetic counselor and geneticist I go to?,"Last fall, I suddenly needed a thoracic aortic aneurysm repair. I had just moved to a new area, so I was sent from the ER to the surgeon. When I finally met my new cardiologist, she said I should see a geneticist since I had an aortic aneurysm with a normal aortic valve and also have scoliosis. Her concern is whether I have a connective tissue disorder that suggests that other areas of my body should be watched for problems known to be part of that disorder.

My new primary care doctor’s referral coordinator sent my information to an excellent university hospital, but the information online says that the counselor works in the cardiology department and seems to focus on cardiovascular issues caused by cancer related issues, and the doctor has a similar focus and also heads the heart transplant program. He doesn’t list anything related to genetics. The geneticists at the university all work in research and don’t see patients.

In reading the characteristics of connective tissue disorders, I clearly have some: hernia, tortuosity of an artery in my head, diaphragmatic eventrations, chronic fatigue, and some others. I’ve been tested twice for all the autoimmune disorders because my eye doctor believes I have Sjogrens, but those tests were all negative.

I just want to find out what to be watched for so that I don’t need emergency surgery again or go through three years of hell because my hernia couldn’t be found. If there are ways to improve my life, that would be good to find out too! And of course, I don’t want to be using up an appointment with the wrong genetic counselor for me when wait times for geneticists are so long, and the right person is out there waiting for it!

What should I do? Should I keep the appointment or ask to see someone else?

Cyp2d6 intermediate metabolism...but only for some cyp2d6 meds and not others? ,"Not asking for advice, asking for someone to make this make sense for me. 

I have had genetic testing done and am a CYP2 D6 intermediate metabolizer. This has proven true to me with SSRI's as they stack up in my system and caused me to become manic or, as with Wellbutrin, psychotic. On my genesite test, it says I can use most amphetamines as directed. I recently started Adderall instant release and wanted to start very low and go very slow due to how other drugs I have taken in the past metabolized through 2D6 have affected me. This includes past recreational use of MDMA and psilocybin… Not recommended. 

In any case I am finding the Adderall is like coffee to me and even at 30 mg is in and out within a couple of hours. I have no real side effects… My heart rate has not really increased a whole lot and I'm even sleeping better. I feel less anxious and less depressed. I am a little confused why Adderall is wearing off so quickly with no side effects but if I took a Prozac for two days would be a hallucinating ball of panic attacks   I am an ultra rapid metabolizer of cyp 219 however which does explain my rapid metabolism for coffee. Thoughts?

I am worried she won’t be able to do things other kids can. She already had a gross motor delay. But I take her to early steps intervention, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and speech therapy. She moves her legs and she is so strong, she kicks and moves her hands around.


My daughter is 15 months old. She puts weight on her feet for a little but she doesn’t walk. She doesn’t hold her bottle. She doesn’t like to hold things she will grab it and throw it. Or grab for a second before she drops it. She enjoys tapping her toys though especially musical toys. She doesn’t crawl yet probably because her upper body isn’t as strong yet. She can’t sit up yet though she wants to. She doesn’t fully extend her arms when on her tummy. And she hates tummy time. But I do it anyways. 


I am just a worried mom this is my first baby. And I am trying so hard to catch her up to her peers. But with the genetic deletion I’m wondering if that’s a possibility. 

* The geneticist mentioned the gene deletion could be related to her motor delay. But she would need a bigger genetic panel test. So I have to wait for that. 

* Her geneticist mentioned getting a deeper genetic panel because she wasn’t entirely sure how big the deletion is so will see. The wait is killing me. But My daughter got a panel from the kidney doctor and neurologist. But now she’s getting a full look into her genetics to better understand the deletion. I’ll know more in a month or two. 

* Both mom and dad we have gotten genetic testing done as well. Neither one of us are carriers of the gene that has the gene deletion. Nor do we have genetic deletions. We did share some variants of insignificant variants. But the geneticist is running a deeper panel on the both of us as well to make sense of my daughters genes. 


She already has to combat kidney dysplasia or kidney disease. She was also a preemie. But she is my strong girl I will love her no matter what. 



I just want some positivity. And see if anyone has a baby like mine she is a year old plus four months. They say her gross motor delay is likely due to a genetic deletion in chromosome 4

Rediagnosis from genetic testing,"Hello!

After doing some research, I found that I may have a similar condition called Legius syndrome.

Invitae SMAD4 in different panels,"Good day,

This is a question in regards to genetic testing and declaration of anomalies with Invitae.

In the last year my partner completed a Connective Tissue panel via [Invitae](https://www.invitae.com/en/providers/test-catalog/test-434340) and one of the 92 genes  sequenced is SMAD4 with the transcript reference NM\_005359.5. This came up with no anomalies noted in their supplement list. 

Another health concern she has is based on family history and some symptoms is Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia which  [Invitae](https://www.invitae.com/en/providers/test-catalog/test-02352) also has SMAD4 in the panel with the same transcript reference NM\_005359.5.

The question is if the Connective Tissue panel would have mentioned any and all anomalies of SMAD4 regardless of it pertaining to a connective tissue or not? My partner is curious if there would be a chance that she  has the mutation for SMAD4 regarding Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and not a connective tissue disorder and that distinction would not have been shared with her.

Would the second test be useful in regards to SMAD4 if it has already been sequenced and returned normal?

How is likely benign determined?,"
Hello, I have a clinical diagnosis of Cowden syndrome, due to multiple symptoms/physical characteristics.  When I first got genetic testing, they found a mutation in the PTEN gene of unknown significance.  Some months later, Ambry genetics contacted my counselor having revised my mutation to “likely benign.”  

I guess I’m just not sure how they determine that.  To me it seems logical - if someone has multiple symptoms/clinical diagnosis of a condition known to be caused by a mutated gene, and has a mutation in that gene, doesn’t it follow they are probably connected?

I asked my genetic counselor but she didn’t add much.  My path is already pretty clear based on my clinical diagnosis , so I’m mostly curious how “benign/not benign” is determined for the sake of my kids and how they might be tested for this mutation someday.

Thanks for any help you can give!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/zglh61/how_is_likely_benign_determined/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9975540041923523

I am not sure if I am allowed to request for this on here. But I am a medical student that is looking to join the British Society for Genetic medicine. The only issue is that I don't currently have a proposer for my application. 

I would love to join the society because I have recently founded our University's first Human and Clinical genetics society, and being a member of the BSGH would be a fantastic opportunity to network with people that currently work in the field. I founded our society because our university didn't really have many opportunities for those that were interested in the subject - so I thought that giving other students opportunities to express this interest would be wonderful. Becoming affiliated in any way with the British society for Genetic medicine would massively help with our goal of providing opportunities and resources for other students to express their interest in genetics!

We were also advised for my husband and I to get tested to see if it is inherited or de novo.

I just found out about genetic counseling and got really excited, but have been concerned about overcoming my low GPA (3.2). Here's a little bit about my background: 
•my degree is in environmental resources with a concentration in conservation bio. So I have taken most of the pre reqs, but chemistry wrecked me in undergrad and I got all C's. 
• I completed my undergrad thesis on the micro climate of bats in torpor, so I have research experience but not really genetics related. 
•after graduation I worked in China as an ESL teacher for a year. I've heard teaching experience can be beneficial.
•after coming back to the us I took a research job with NMFS as a fisheries observer... So again, research but not really genetics related.
•I currently work for a zoo as an assistant. I'm trying to get involved in my colleagues' genetic work as much as possible while I plan my next move and get my materials ready.

My questions are: 
*Is my gpa so low I shouldn't bother applying? I was planning on retaking all of the chem classes I got cs in and obviously acing the pre reqs I need to take before I can apply. But would that be enough? Would a post bacc look better? I would like a completely honest answer, even if the answer is that I ruined my chances in undergrad.

I have been a tutor for multiple biology classes and various other classes for 4 years, founded a biology open lab my freshman year, and have worked in an offspring of that original lab for 2 years. I will be head of that lab this coming semester. 

I have been an active member of best buddies for 3 years and have 4 years of volunteer experience with special needs people. I have also been an active member of my school's pride alliance program for 4 years. 

Based on all of this, is there any chance of me getting into a genetic counseling program? My GPA isn't very good so it makes me very very nervous.

How to make my return to school worthwhile?,"I returned to school in the last few years to get some prerequisites that would make me more competitive in the graduate programs I'm interested in. Currently that's MPH, Genetic Counseling, and Bioinformatics. The rundown for me is that have a BS in psychology, neuroscience lab experience (and publication), 3.7 undergrad GPA. Since returning to school I've taken Microbiology (A), Genetics (C), Genomics (A), Virology (A), and a programming course (A). I'm hopeful about getting a callback for a job as a contact tracer for Covid-19 and I think this would fulfill the crisis counselling experience that a lot of GC programs seem to look for. If that falls through I'll be looking for volunteer opportunities. I also may not be able to shadow a GC because of Covid but I plan to seek one out very soon just to talk to.

So, I think that's the outline so far. I didn't even know about GC when I was in school the first time so I didn't do any preparations for it then, but I think it is my top choice for graduate studies and I want to see if y'all have any insight on how much further I have to go to be competitive for GC programs in the States or Canada. In particular will I need to re-take Genetics?  I am signed up for a summer course in a week, and that will really be my only option to retake it unless I want to wait another year. Or should I just spend time studying for the GRE instead? Or should I focus on something else like Biostats and further genetic science courses? Is there anything else that I need to look into?

Healthcare genomics data,"Hi clinical genetics community, I'm a healthcare data scientist but have very little experience working with genomic datasets.  I was wondering if anyone could help with a question related to the typical formats and repositories for clinical genomics data in a health system setting.  Does anyone work for a hospital or health system that could shed light?  For example, I know that typically specific panels are ordered like perinatal or breast cancer screening.  Do those results come back with a variant file or does it typically function as a lab result transaction?  Also, I know some health systems are working with genomics partners like Color and Helix; in that case, do the health systems get the patient genomic data returned to them in a usable format?  And finally, under what circumstances would the full genome sequence data be available to a health system - is that something that is at all common yet?

Help reading my thalassemia results,"Hello,
I got a blood test for thalassemia few days ago and went to my GP yesterday for results. He told me I'm alpha thalassemia positive and he explained to me all the things about it. After this, I did some reading about it and learned about the missing gene count. My GP didn't tell me about how many genes I'm missing and I didn't ask as I dont know about it yet at that time. Now Im wonderinf which kind of Alpha thalassemia I have. I know for sure I don't have the severe one (4 genes missing if not mistaken).
I'm a guy, 30 years of age, came from South East Asia (Filipino).
He gave me a printed out copy but can't see anything indicating what kind of Alpha Thal I am.
It says exactly like tuis:
Haemoglobin A2: 2.5% (2.2 - 3.3)
Haemoglobin F: <1.2% ( <1.2)
Haemoglobin EPP: No abnormal band detected
Haemoglobin A: 97.5%

Definition of digenic recessive and digenic dominant,"Hi,

I stumbled upon cases of digenic inheritance in OMIM. They label them in two classes :

DD - Digenic dominant, DR - Digenic recessive

I found no statement by omim directly how they define the terms. Only one external definition (without further reference):

“In *OMIM* (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man), digenic inheritance is classified into two categories: Digenic dominant inheritance is defined as heterozygous mutations in two genes, while digenic recessive inheritance signifies a homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in one gene and a heterozygous mutation in a second gene.”

[https://bmcmedgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12881-018-0618-5](https://bmcmedgenet.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12881-018-0618-5)

But there is the obvious third case where all four alleles have to be hit by pathogenic variants [https://www.omim.org/entry/602024](https://www.omim.org/entry/602024). Which is also labeled as DR.

So there are two labels for at least three different cases.

Does anyone know a good definition or alternative better labeling for these cases?

CGX Testing,"Full disclosure, I am a CLIA Lab Director with a specialty in Molecular Diagnostics and have clients in the space (germline and somatic genetic testing).

Recent DOJ and Medicare crackdowns have drastically cut the number of labs performing CGX testing- getting rid of the bad actors is a good thing but for the good guys this is a bottom line issue- clawbacks and moratoriums on testing for following the rules is going to put a bunch of labs out of business. BUT I agree that Medicare patients whose age eligibility is about 65 years the family history is of limited usefulness. This however does not rule out the utility for germ-line testing of patients diagnosed with breast, ovarian, colon etc given treatment regimens and prognosis for BRCA and MMR are different for patients with the underlying germ-line mutation. Ideally testing should be done in early 20's based on family history so that appropriate surgical, family planning and lifestyle interventions can be addressed, but good luck getting Medicaid and insurance to pay. 

Also $10,000-15,000 reimbursement is cray- My cogs for virtual panels run off exomes on a Novaseq S4 reagent kit are <<10% of that figure, reflexing to other technologies for dels/dups and pseudogene analysis (dreaded PMS2) add only a little more.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/e3ii8u/cgx_testing/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9987667798995972
Assessing conditional PPV of cfDNA screens that return positive for Monosomy X,"After my wife’s NIPT (Harmony) returned positive for Monosomy X, we dug into the research extensively.  We disagree with our Genetic Counselor’s assessment — ballpark 40% chance baby has Turner Syndrome.  Specifically, we accept the 40% figure as a reasonable generic estimate of the PPV for the entire population of pregnant mothers who screen positive for Monosomy X on cfDNA tests.   (Though it is by no means confirmed. [26.1%](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ajmg.c.31675) may be the best and most current available estimate.).  But, conditional on relevant factors from the Turner Syndrome literature, we believe our specific probability is far lower.

As we understand it, cfDNA screens are extremely effective at determining that a “missing X” exists somewhere in the maternal blood sample.  This step of the process is basically unproblematic.  The possibility of a false positive is almost entirely due to the possibility that the dna with the missing X might originate from sources other than the fetus: from the placenta, a vanished twin, or the mother.  cfDNA screens are unable to distinguish among the sources.  In our case, we take it as virtually certain that my wife’s blood sample did in fact contain some DNA with a “missing X.”

Beyond that, we differ with our GC regarding interpretation of the data.  We believe that the mathematics of conditional probability dictate that, given our particulars, the probability that baby has Monosomy X — especially non-mosaic form — *must* be lower.  We believe it is much lower.  GC not only disagrees, but believes our particulars don’t affect the final probability at all.

Our particulars:
* Prior Familial history of genetic risk factors: None
* Ultrasound abnormalities: None
* Maternal Age: 34
* NT: 2.5mm (86th percentile) at CRL=7.34cm (13w3d)
* FHR at time of NT ultrasound: 159bpm

In other words, none of the classic markers of Monosomy X are present.  We recognize that it’s possible for a fetus with Monosomy X to show none of these markers, but that situation appears to occur rarely, especially in the case of non-mosaic Monosomy X.

The cfDNA screen essentially narrows it down to 3 possibilities:  

1. Fetus has full blown Turner Syndrome
2. Fetus has mosaic Turner Syndrome
3. Maternal blood contains “missing X” DNA originating from some other source.

Aside from the PPV and False Positive Rate, the screen provides zero information about which case we’re dealing with.  But the priors, ultrasound results, MA, NT, and FHR are all statistically significant predictors.  I have seen literature synthesizing cfDNA and classic marker screens to increase the final PPV in the case of Trisomy.  There is some research attempting to do the same with Monosomy X (eg, [this](https://fetalmedicine.org/abstracts/2018/var/pdf/abstracts/2018/3037.pdf) paper from 2018 synthesizing NT results with Monosomy X-positive cfDNA screens) but far less than the Trisomies and there are no comparable “official” guidelines for synthesizing.  The only sense I can make of the situation is that the Trisomies have been researched far more comprehensively.

Still, the fact that many unanswered questions on the topic remain shouldn’t negate the proposition that conditional probability should apply altogether.  Is there any reason I’m not seeing as to why classic markers shouldn’t alter the final probability that a Monosomy X-positive cfDNA screen indicates a true positive, potentially drastically?

EDIT, May 2020: A few weeks later we spoke with the Chief Geneticist.  He agreed with this analysis, citing the normal NT and clear ultrasounds so far as the encouraging signals he was seeing.  Since baby was high risk for Turner, they did a level 2 fetal anatomy scan at 20 weeks, came back clear.  I said to the geneticist from what I can tell, these indicators in combination ought to put her real risk at under 5% (Honestly I put the number at <1% as the best guess based on available information, but I was more interested in hearing whether an accomplished authority on the subject thought I was in the neighborhood than quibbling over a reasonable cutoff number).  He said while available research leaves him unable to put a number on it, “You may well be right on that.  I don’t think it’s a false hope.”

Baby recently arrived.  Healthy as can be.  And a week later, we received word on the karyotype from Genetics: Our daughter has both X chromosomes, and is genetically normal.😊",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/e2ryec/assessing_conditional_ppv_of_cfdna_screens_that/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9956047534942627

I have spent a lot of time researching about what it takes to be a genetic counsellor, and I see that a lot of prospective GC students have a lot more going on than I do.

Questions on poland syndrome," Hi doctors of reddit ! this is my first time posting in this subreddit. I have poland syndrome and i have few questions about it. Does poland syndrome only causes no / less muscles on the chest area or can it affect other parts of the body? Poland syndrome affects the left side of my body but i don't know if it affects other parts of my body. The reason i'm asking this is to know is it possible for it to affect the face ? For as long as i can remember, i can never uhh, ""move"" the left side of my face thus was never able to smile. When i asked my dad about it, he just laughed it off and said i just forgot how to move it. It sounds kinda stupid to forget how to move your muscle. Can anyone provide some explaination ?

Job prospect (Canada),"Hello,

I was hoping to see if someone could tell the situation regarding job prospect in Canada for recent grads. 

I am currently in my first year GC Masters program in the US but I want to go back and practice in Canada. I’ve heard that job opportunities are more limited than in the US but I was hoping someone could give me some information on how easy/hard it is to find GC jobs in Canada.

What are my chances?,"Hi! I am a junior in undergrad and I am getting rather anxious about applying to a GC program (I'm thinking about BU, MGH, Brandeis, Mt. Sinai, Thomas Jefferson - I want to stay in the Northeast), so I was wondering if anyone had any advice for me. 

&#x200B;

I am a neuroscience major and a clinical psychology minor and my undergraduate GPA is probably my biggest weakness. At the time of application it will only be around a 3.3-3.4 (classic orgo killed me story).  My grades in some of my prereqs are an A in introductory biology, B in introductory chemistry, C in orgo, B+ in stats, A in all of my psychology classes, and an A in biochemistry. I got a B- in introductory genetics but I then took an upper level genetics class and got an A in it. I am also a TA for the class I got a B- in because the professor knew how much I loved genetics. 

&#x200B;

I have not taken the GRE yet but I am expecting to get around the average suggested percentile for grad school applications because I am a good standardized test taker. 

&#x200B;

I worked in a wet lab looking at pediatric brain cancer at Boston Children's Hospital for two summers and this summer I will be working as Genetic Counseling Assistant. I work in a clinical research lab looking at Pediatric Mental Health and Intervention through the school year. I also shadow a genetic counselor for two hours once a week (been going on for a few months and will continue), I am a part of the Crisis Text Line (a few months) and I volunteer with adults with developmental disabilities once a week (for about two years). 

&#x200B;

Please let me know what I could do to strengthen my application! Thank you so much.

Specific importance of crisis counseling vs. other volunteer experiences?,"Unsurprisingly given the time of year, there have been several posts recently asking for some feedback on the odds of acceptance/strengths and weaknesses of hopeful GC program applicants. I am also applying this round (unfortunately to a limited set of programs, due to limitations arising from my personal life, so I expect to have longer odds than someone with similar credentials but more flexibility.)

It seems like even when folks have other volunteer experience that I would have expected to be relevant, they are often urged to seek crisis counseling experience specifically. Is this reflecting a strong preference on the part of GC programs themselves? The program descriptions I have read and a few conversations with current GCs had led me to believe that any extended experience that builds communication skills, gives you experience interacting with a diverse set of people, and is a supportive role of some kind would be a genuinely helpful prerequisite and responsive to what programs are looking for in a prospective student. Is that not correct?

And of course I'm asking because I have not done crisis counseling . . . however I do have extensive volunteer experience that I believed to be relevant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/adxdql/specific_importance_of_crisis_counseling_vs_other/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9693673253059387
Applying this year or not,"Hi,

I really do want to become a genetic counselor eventually, but I feel like my resume isn't strong enough to compete with others. I graduated from a UC in Genetics, so I should have most if not all of the required classes completed. I interned/worked in research labs for 2 years in college. 
I am now a research associate for a company that makes assays to detect certain diseases such as leukemia. I also just started volunteering as a crisis text line counselor. I also plan on shadowing a genetic counselor sometime next year if I can find some time off and find the opportunity to do so. 
I feel that since I've only been doing my current job and crisis text line for about 1 month, that it's still not enough to apply. I know that I probably won't get in for the upcoming year, but I was wondering if I should just try and apply to 3 or 4 schools anyways to let them get to know me better and ask them for advice on how to boost my chances or something like that? Or should I just wait till next year when my resume is stronger and then apply.

I did a year internship with a genetic testing company basically doing anything and everything, including adding mutations to tests, speaking to our sales representatives and doctors about genetic testing, and writing up positive test results (the information about seeking help and the risks). Now, I just began as a data analyst for a company that works with pharmaceuticals and pre clinical trials. Not where I want to be, but it pays the bills. From experience and my major and coursework alone, would I have stood out among applicants?

What are my odds of getting into a genetic counseling program and how can I do better?,"Hi guys! I’ve been struggling through undergrad trying to pin down exactly what I want to do, but I truly think genetic counseling is a good fit for me. I’m a junior at the moment and plan to apply for programs next year, so I want to know what I can do in the meantime to improve my chances. 

I’m a biology major with minors in neuroscience and psychology. My GPA is currently a 3.91 but I expect that to fall a little bit. I have not taken the GRE yet but plan to do so next month and over the summer if my scores aren’t up to par.

I do not work, but I’ve spent time shadowing at the Alzheimer’s Disease center in town, as well as doing research under one of the program’s coordinators looking at the effects of stress and other factors on the health of older adults as well as biofeedback as an indicator of stress. Over the summer I hope to meet with a genetic counselor here in town and shadow her. I’m also going to start volunteering with the Crisis Text Line to get that sort of experience as well. 

(Side note: I haven’t taken biochemistry yet but have taken cell biology which I am aware of being different. How necessary is this requirement? I’m planning to take it regardless, but I’m just curious. I’ve also taken a genetics course and am signed up for a human genetics elective next semester.)

2017 Code Talker Award,"*Genome* magazine is seeking nominations for the 2017 [Code Talker Award](http://genomemag.com/codetalker/), which honors genetic counselors and the amazing work they do to support people in challenging situations. The deadline to enter is **JUNE 1!!!**


The Code Talker Award is an essay contest for patients and their families to pay tribute to a genetic counselor by nominating him or her for an award to be presented at NSGC’s annual education conference.

Essay nominations from patients, caregivers, and peers will detail the compassion, expertise, and helpfulness a genetic counselor had for a patient or his or her family.

After culling through hundreds of essays, *Genome’s* editorial team will choose three finalists. Finalists, the essayists, plus one guest each, will receive round-trip airfare and a two-night stay in Columbus, Ohio, where they will be honored at a reception on September 15 during the NSGC conference. The essays will be read aloud, and one genetic counselor will be awarded a special prize in recognition of his or her service to patients.

At the end of the program, each attendee will receive a book filled with up to 40 heart felt essays and beautiful photography. This book will educate its reader by providing insights into what patients and their families value most in genetic counselors. Extra copies of the book will be provided for distribution to genetic counselors that were unable to attend the event. The book will serve as an enduring testament to the important role genetic counselors play in the quality of people’s lives.

Just Diagnosed with Schwartz Jamper Syndrome. A genetic mutation that since it's discovery in 1962 there are only 149 reported cases.,"Hi, 

I had no idea that this sub existed but then again there is a sub for everything.

4 years ago I started having neurological symptoms mainly stiffness, cramping them weakness. After 179 pages of tests, MRI's and gazillions of blood tests still nothing.

Being told it was in my head even after 2 psych evals I almost gave up. In Florida I found a doctor that suspected Myotonia Congenita. He ordered me a genetic test.

Last week I got the results with a mutated gene called HSPG2. It's autosomal recessive and I am a carrier predicted pathogenic.

Being it is so rare there is almost no information on this. Remember 149 cases in 54 years, Not a lot of data.  

Not only is this very rare, it is almost always diagnosed in early childhood. For me it popped up it's ugly head when I was 47

College Senior Interested in Genetic Counseling,"Hi! I sort of stumbled onto this subreddit and am fairly new to Reddit, so sorry if I suck at this. I'm currently a senior, finishing up my undergraduate studies. I plan to graduate in the summer of 2017. I'm a Health Sciences major, with a minor in Psychology, so the entirety of my major has been science courses like Chemistry, Biology, Physics, Anatomy & Phys, Gross Anatomy, and some more exercise science specific courses. 

I had always planned on becoming an Occupational Therapist, but after taking my first and only course available on the field, I'm not entirely sure my heart is in it, and I want to find a career I love before I spend time building up my qualifications and going to graduate school for it. 

I stumbled upon Genetic Counseling when looking at programs my school offers, and I can't really explain it, but I immediately just felt like it was right for me. I definitely need to shadow, but I'm really interested in the field. I love science and health, and I'm a very empathetic person and have always been the sort of ""go to"" when my friends need advice, and it seems like Genetic Counseling caters to those two strengths a lot. 

I'm just a little worried about getting started so late in the game when it seems like all the current student bios I've read make me feel SO behind. I've unfortunately never been able to find open positions in labs, and have never involved myself in crisis counseling or volunteer experience other than service trips and tutoring children in inner-city schools. My list of student involvement is pretty long, but doesn't relate much to the field (involved in my sorority, being a recruitment counselor & then a recruitment director for 600 women during sorority recruitment, University Honors Program, Honors Ambassador, a Greek honor society)

Is it still possible to successfully pursue this route getting started as a senior? I'm taking a year off of school after I graduate in the summer to get my life together, and I anticipate being able to immerse myself in research and volunteering then, in addition to some shadowing this year, but I worry that I just don't stand a chance with such low acceptance rates! My GPA is a 3.47 and I anticipate it going up a little bit within the next few semesters. I'm just scared to put my everything into this and not being able to measure up!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/56vnz9/college_senior_interested_in_genetic_counseling/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9913771152496338

Looking to interview Genetic Counselors or Clinicians that offer carrier screening.,"I work with a healthcare design firm in Massachusetts (www.goinvo.com) and we’re doing research on carrier screening. We're looking to talk with Genetic Counselors or Clinicians that offer carrier screening for people planning to have a child. We want to understand how you inform patients about carrier screening, to ordering the tests, to discussing the results and next steps with patients.

We’d like to have a 20 minute conversation to hear your thoughts on that process. In exchange for your time, we'll send you a $50 Amazon Gift Card.

We would really appreciate getting more representative feedback from professionals in the field.

If you're interested, please private message me so we can setup a time to discuss.

Are interviews sometimes done in a group setting or is everything individual? 
Does anyone have any tips for standing out in an interview?

Resources for Rare Genetic Disorders?,"My son has an extremely rare genetic disorder and I'm wondering if there are any databases or resources for parents and children with rare genetic disorders. We've heard of [Unique](http://www.rarechromo.org/), but that hasn't been much help for connecting us with anyone.

His genetic disorder is unnamed, but is Mosaic Trisomy Ring 20. If there is any interest, I can dig up the exact genetic profile that was worked up when he was diagnosed. I've searched and (with assistance from a med student I know) found some research papers, but it seems like there have been fewer than 10 people ever diagnosed with this.

If anyone has ever heard of this, or has any questions about this disorder, please post or PM. We'd love to assist the scientific community by adding his data to the pool or in any other way possible.

Thanks!




Edit - I appreciate all the comments and PMs. I've never heard of some of the sites, I'll investigate them.

I must highlight though that this is TRISOMY ring 20, which is a distinct disorder from ring 20. A quote from the ring20.org site ""This supernumerary r(20) causes multiple anomalies but no epilepsy, and the resulting syndrome should be differentiated from r(20) syndrome.

Limited counseling experience,"Hi everyone, I just joined reddit today just to post here! :D I'm an undergraduate senior studying Biology and I hope to apply to genetic counseling schools next year. I know there's already a similar posting about shadowing/ internships from a couple months ago, but I figured that I'd make my own post.

Like that similar poster, I've had trouble finding counseling experience that is required to apply to schools. Luckily, after calling dozens of genetic counselors in my area (I'm pretty sure I've annoyed quite a bit haha), I've found a shadowing program at Kaiser but it only lasts one month. Do you think this will be good enough in order to apply to schools next year? This specific Kaiser Medical Center has many different genetic counselors so I feel like I'd learn a lot, though I wish it was longer. :(

Furthermore, for actual counseling volunteer experience, I've found a suicide hotline program but I won't be able to start my training until late January of next year. Therefore, I probably would only have ~6 months of counseling volunteer experience before applying. Would I be at a severe disadvantage compared to other applicants? :\

I only recently decided to pursue genetic counseling six months ago, so it's been quite difficult finding counseling volunteer positions within this short time span.

I would really like your input, guys! And also, I'm really tempted to post my current resume and ask what you guys think of it but I don't want to make this text post any longer, LOL.

Applying to genetic counseling programs from a postdoc position,"Hi all,

I am a postdoc studying developmental biology at a university in the American northeast for the last year or so, and I was seriously thinking about a change in carrier toward genetic counseling, and away from research, as few faculty positions exist, funding is limited, and I'm starting to loose interest in my field. I would be applying to Canadian programs, as that is my country of citizenship and where I want to end up back eventually. I got my PhD in molecular biology at a major Canadian university.

Would it be considered 'too late' to apply for genetic counseling programs at this stage? Would they prefer to give spots to students who don't already have an advanced degree and training? Would I be at a disadvantage somehow? I just turned 30 a month ago.

I'm planning on volunteering at a crisis line this summer, but other than that I have a solid academic CV and publication record. Any advice and help would be appreciated!

Last year we saw pancreatic cancer included into the criteria, and now 2013 brings us prostate cancer. Basically, any family that has 3 or more individuals with breast, ovary, pancreas or aggressive prostate cancer would warrant the consideration for genetic counseling and testing. 

Other changes include the testing criteria for TP53 and Cowden syndrome. Any woman with breast cancer at or before age 35, with negative BRCA testing qualifies for TP53 testing.

I applied to quite a few schools, and was only invited to one interview. Because I am weaker than other applicants in some areas (specifically my GPA), I am relying heavily on this interview. As such, I want to be very, very well prepared.

I am extensively researching the program's website and I have a few mock-interviews set up at career services. Do any of you have any additional suggestions?

Also, if things don't work out and I don't make it into this program, I still plan on finding out what I need to ""fix"" and applying again next year. However, I need to find something to do in the meantime. If any of you have personal stories or advice regarding that, I would love to hear it.

acid-maltase deficiency (Pompe Disease),"Hello all, first time poster here. Just wondering if anyone is working or has worked on anything related to this LSD. Where are you doing the work? Anything new and exciting?

I have adult-onset and I am currently asymptomatic which, if I understand correctly, makes me very unusual. I see my geneticist (who is also a neurologist) in May for my follow-up. So far all tests have been normal with the exception of a *slight* glitch on my EMG and some ""insignificant"" cellular build-up on my first and only MRI.

Anyway, I'm just curious if anyone here has an experience with Pompe disease. Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/18djbt/acidmaltase_deficiency_pompe_disease/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9947912693023682

Non-invasive fetal genome sequencing during pregnancy a possibility? Whoa.,"The use of cell-free fetal DNA will likely quickly be used in most prenatal settings for the screening of certain conditions (aneuploidies). Most data on its accuracy show that it may soon be a standard of care (though there will be some debate). But the other questions I have had are related to fetal genome sequencing if the full fetal genome is represented in maternal plasma (8-fold according to one study). Is this a possibility? Would people want this? Theoretically, it is possible. Cell-free fetal DNA has even been used in some research trials for single-gene disorders (Huntington disease, achondroplasia, and CF I believe).
Here is a small write up regarding fetal genome sequencing during pregnancy using the new noninvasive technology (cell-free fetal DNA). Link can be found here: http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/gnxp/2012/06/genome-sequencing-of-the-unborn/

Update to Beckwith Wiedmann Syndrome testing and question about next steps (CMA),"I posted here before about my child’s geneticist investigating for Beckwith Wiedmann Syndrome, and you all were super helpful so I’m here again!

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/s/2ktUoZmvht

As an update, we finally went for follow-up today and we did the CMA and methylation test. 

The geneticist mentioned that with the CMA, we could end up with ambiguous results. The idea of this makes me really nervous - I’m already a hypochondriac and this whole process has made me anxious. I’m trying to tell myself that we’re just doing our due diligence and following the doctor’s recommendations. 

Now the idea of possibly receiving an  “uncertain” finding has me wondering if I’m just opening doors we shouldn’t and driving our family down a road that could lead to more anxiety. 

Can anybody shed some more light on CMA, and how often uncertain results occur? Should we have done this test?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/1g91qul/update_to_beckwith_wiedmann_syndrome_testing_and/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9981227517127991

Help me understand my baby’s mosaicism please,"I first noticed hyperpigmentation on my 3 month old baby girl when she was 8 weeks old.

But I’m still struggling to understand whether or not my daughter’s condition is limited to her skin or if she will have other symptoms. So far she seems healthy and is hitting her milestones. The only thing out of the ordinary which I noticed when she was born is that her eyes are slanted upwards, and that doesn’t run in the family.

Bug's MT-ATP6 Fight,"Hello everyone, I am sharing the story of our dear friend's 5 year old son and his fight with Mito. Please share if you are able to spread awareness and garner support for this rare disease.

""In school we all learned how to stop, drop, and roll, to always avoid quicksand, and Mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cells. Turns out, we misunderstood the assignment. 😆😅 We stopped, our hearts dropped, our brains rolled, and we felt like we were sinking in quicksand. All because our powerhouses lost power. Please don't mistake our lightheartedness over the subject, we know this diagnosis isn't what anyone wants to hear, especially about their own baby, and we agree,  but sulking won't solve anything or cure him. So instead we've chosen to look at the light and make everyday count, no one is promised tomorrow. 

My son, (we call him Bug), was born in the spring of 2019. We found out while at an ultrasound that Bug had Hydronephrosis and 11 months after he was born he had his left kidney removed. At 6 months old we noticed his left arm and leg wouldn't move so physical therapy was brought in to help. At about a year and a half he started to shake from head to toe, making daily everyday tasks hard for him to do. We got sent to a Neurologist for testing to find out why, what his doctor described as baby Parkinsons, (even though babies can't get Parkinsons), was happening. Through our Neurologist Bug was diagnosed with Myloclonus-Dystonia, a rare movement disorder that combines rapid, involuntary muscle contractions (Myloclonus) with sustained twisting and repetitive movements (Dystonia). He started seizure medication at 2 to help control it. Due to his tremors we started genetic testing but got no answers for three years until recently when we was hospitalized due to double ear infections and tonsillitis. As most would know with Autism comes ARFID and food adverions. So we struggled, (and still do), with finding food he will like, so when he stopped eating entirely we were concerned. He went from 52 pounds to 47 pounds due to this, his doctors told us while he wasn't eating solid foods all of his tests were coming back normal and recommended we keep supplementing with Pediasure and vitamins daily and referred us to a feeding/Autism clinic. We was released from the hospital after an almost week and a half to go home (two hours away) were we then got a call the next day to go back to the hospital. They explained to us over the phone there was possibly a genetic mutation in his Mitochondrial cells, called MT-ATP6 and they needed to confirm it if so. We were spinning when we got off the phone and as most people do we went to Dr. Google to see what MT-ATP6 was. What we read made our hearts drop and our minds race. The tests were done and sent to the Mayo Clinic, after days of sleepless nights and stress painting Avengers on Bug's walls we got the call that confirmed their suspicions into our reality, Bug has MT-ATP6 gene mutation. Because they had already had him on seizure medication for the Myloclonus-Dystonia we had never seen him have an actual seizure... Until last month when we had his first confirmed one that lasted a total of 5 hours, but due to his muscle condition and the fact he had enever had a confirmed seizure we were unaware that night that it was any different than before. Until the next morning when his head was laying on his right shoulder and his muscle weakness was far greater than it has ever been. His walking became unsteady and he became lethargic. The following day it was confirmed that he was in fact having seizures. We were then givin an emergency kit and instructed to administer it for any seizure lasting longer than 5 minutes. On the evening of diagnosis day we took to social media as everyone does to find others in our position, only to find that we are essentially alone in our journey here in the US. According to a study published in the Neurology Genetics there has been approximately 132 confirmed cases of both active mutation and carriers of the mutation. Upon learning this fact it became abundantly clear that finding others would be like finding a needle in a hay stack, not the easiest job in the world but not impossible, and if Bug's life so far has taught us anything it's that we love a good challenge and we won't give up until we can help at least one family in our shoes. We didn't find a support group, so if we can create one, even if it only spreads awareness, we will. 

This is our story.""

Does trio whole exome sequencing pick up UPD? Can microarrays pick it up? ,"I'm currently awaiting my daughter's methylation DNA testing to see if she has PWS. Her symptoms have been much milder than most people with PWS, so I'm crossing my fingers. 

We've already had trio WES with another doctor. Would this have detected UPD on chromosome 15? She's also had two microarrays which were clear. The doctor requesting the current suite of tests isn't a geneticist and has requested some things that we've already run.

Microarray found region of AOH on chromosome 15q25-26,"My son is 11 months old and currently has a global developmental delay. His SNP microarray test results came back as ""Normal Male"" with a note that they found 22.871 Mb of Absence of Heterozygosity within chromosome 15 (chr15:79558146-102429049). Along with microarray my son was also tested for fragile X and Prader-Willi Syndrome. Those were negative. They did not test for Angelman Syndrome.

We were referred to a pediatric geneticist for a consultation, however it will take up to 6 months to happen, wait time is absolutely insane.

We've been reading different info about UPD on chromosome 15 and different imprinting disorders, trying to understand if his developmental delay is associated with this AOH.

I have not found any info about problems caused by UPD specifically in this chromosome region, only issues due to deletions or duplications, which he doesn't have according to microarray.

There is a paternally expressed gene in 15q26.3 region (IGF1R), which would cause a growth retardation and a failure thrive if missing. My son doesn't have this health concern, quite an opposite - he's been 95-97% weight and height since \~2 months old. That leads us to believe that he has paternal genes in that region of AOH.

I guess I am looking for any extra information anyone can provide.

Seeking more data on 7p22.1p21.3 microdeletion associated with RAC1,"Hi, I have my amnio chromosome microarray results with the said comments.

Loss of 1.07mb within chromosome band 7p22.1p21.3 associated with gene RAC1 which is of uncertain significance.

I tried to google on the internet but could not find much data as it seemed to be very rare.

I have spoken to the geneticist and genetic counsellor regarding this results report but they could not give me a definite conclusion. Again, it was said to be rare and new so not much data.

What I would like to know is that:
1. Do all of us have this gene RAC1 in our DNA?
2. What does this gene RAC1 actually do? I read that it is related to the brain functionality and development. 
3. If one of the RAC1 gene is missing (usually all are in a pair of chromosomes), can a person still function normally with one of the RAC1 gene?
4. If there isn’t much data, does it mean that the survival probability is low?

Microarray: microduplication of uncertain clinical significance,"Please share experience, advice, knowledge, etc for our very unexpected CVS microarray finding below. 

**Background:** this is an IUI pregnancy via donor sperm to avoid passing on our single recessive gene condition. I have two kids conceived naturally and I'm 37. Due to our single gene condition, I just wanted to do more testing if we could. So we did CVS microarray for peace of mind. Genetic counselor told us microarray gives more info than karyotype and no need to do both. I was wanting to test for our single gene condition as well just for peace of mind but CVS sample was contaminated with my cell and they had to spend extra long for culturing. Anyway, we are very shocked about the CVS finding and really frustrated about what to make of it.

We are doing test on me and possibly donor next. But was told even if it's passed down from us and we are healthy, the baby could still have issues because people with the same mutation can show it differently :( Also, this is very rare, so seems like no documentation so far? but some people who have Gli2 mutation clearly have issues. I thought ultrasound/MRI will show issues if baby is affected, but our counselor said not necessarily :( They referenced some database here but I don't know what it means. Seems like normal people have duplication of this size, but not the same duplication has been observed. Also, there are only 2 people have it out of like 10,000. Is this good or bad?

We terminated last year due to being affected by our single gene condition again and IVF didn't work for us. I thought IUI with a very healthy donor is the way to go, but really don't know what to do now. Our counselor said IUI could increase risks like this because it's an artificial technology. I thought IUI is like natural pregnancy and didn't expect to hear this :(

What genetic testing should I ask for after baby is born?,"I’m scheduled for induction in 2 weeks with baby boy who was flagged on an NIPT test for a chromosome 15 microdeletion (PWS/AS). I also have severe Polyhydramnios (AFI has been around 41cm for the past 5 weeks).

We did not do an amino so are waiting until he is born for a formal diagnosis. 

I know there are some obvious signs of PWS to look out for right away, but AS not so much. Polyhydramnios is not super common with either of those syndromes, so I also wonder if there’s a chance the NIPT flagged a true issue but with the wrong chromosome? 

Also even if the NIPT flag is a true false positive or confined to the placenta, there may still be another issue causing the poly. 

I’ll be meeting with a NICU doctor this week at the hospital where I’m delivering. 

What questions should I ask the NICU doctor to cover all of my potential concerns and diagnoses?

Also, what specific genetic tests should I ask for when baby is born? I want to make sure I put these tests on my birth plan and go over them with the NICU doctor this week.

15q11.2 loss on the long arm of chromosome 15 ,"Hi everyone, Im sure someone will contact me to discuss my daughters microarray results but I am very impatient and curious. These are her results. Does anyone here have insights to share? What is the difference between a ""loss"" and ""deletion""?

A copy number loss on the long arm of chromosome 15 at band 15q11.2 was observed by chromosomal microarray. This loss is at least 791 kb in size from base pairs 22,509,195 to 23,300,287. 

The loss at 15q11.2 identified in this individual is of uncertain significance. This 791 kb region contains at least 6 RefSeq genes, including GOLGA6L1, TUBGCP5, CYFIP1, NIPA2, NIPA1, and WHAMMP3, and is consistent with a 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion. This is NOT the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) or Angelman syndrome (AS) deletion. Deletions of this region associated with PWS or AS are typically either a type I deletion between breakpoints 1 and 3 (BP1 and BP3) or a type II deletion between breakpoints 2 and 3 (BP2 and BP3). The deletion identified here is positioned between breakpoints 1 and 2 (BP1 and BP2) in a region of 15q11.2 that is not imprinted. There is some disagreement in the literature on the significance of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion (Hashemi et al., 2015; Jønch et al., 2019). While this deletion has been identified in individuals with autism, developmental delays, seizures, and behavioral concerns (Burnside et al., 2011; Cafferkey et al., 2104; Butler, 2017), its significance is controversial as there are many phenotypically normal carriers of this deletion and penetrance has been estimated to be as low as 10.4% (Rosenfeld et al., 2013). In most cases, the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion is inherited from a parent. Given the conflicting information available regarding the significance of 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletions, this variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/1dk01e0/15q112_loss_on_the_long_arm_of_chromosome_15/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9994093179702759

Short Femur and Humerus measurements at 32w Ultrasound… 20w showed normal growth,"Today, we had our 32-week ultrasound to check growth, and the femur and humerus measured in the <1% percentile. Everything else in the scan came back normal, and skeletal dysplasia has been ruled out by the genetics counselor and doctor. The femur and humerus show no fractures, hypomineralization, or abnormal conformation (e.g., bowing). The tibia and fibula are measuring normally, and facial features are normal, as are the hands (no trident or bowing pinky finger). The ultrasound technician said it was a bit difficult to get a good measurement due to our baby being scrunched up.

In our 20-week ultrasound, we had a much better look at the baby’s femur and humerus, and they were measuring normally at that time. I’m here to ask if long bone measurements at 32 weeks are inaccurate, and if it would be better to consider the 20-week ultrasound as a more accurate measurement. Is it possible for growth to change from the 2nd to the 3rd trimester? It seems unlikely to me, but if anyone with a medical background in ultrasound measurements could provide more understanding of what happened today, I would greatly appreciate it. I am holding on to the positive information and feedback from the genetics doctor and counselor. They want us to come back in 4 weeks to follow up on weight and possibly get another measurement.

"Husband has heterozygous deletion (6q15q16.1, 3.2 Mb) - is PGT warranted? ","We have had genetic counselling and were advised of ~13 other known cases in the medical literature of deletions in a similar location but of varying sizes (about half of them smaller, half larger). Among the genes missing due to my husband’s deletion (which are of unknown significance), one gene appears to be common between them (EPHA7) and they said was postulated as a risk factor for the developmental issues reported (developmental delays, intellectual disability, behavioural issues (potentially including ADHD and autism)). They kept stressing this is a small number of cases reported and it could be ascertainment bias, but on the flip side that it could also be confirmed in the future as causing issues as more cases are recorded. The parents of these individuals were also unaffected (like my husband). We have a healthy 18 month old son (no signs of delays or issues) and have not had him tested yet. 

I feel as though we’ve been given a whole lot of information but with no clear direction on next steps. The risks sounded significant to me according to what we were told so I’ve started looking into IVF and PGT to see whether that might be an option to screen out embryos with the deletion. However, I go back and forth between thinking we could be doing all this for nothing, and worrying ourselves to death for no reason. But we’re also not risk takers and feel like this decision could affect the rest of our lives if the problems mentioned do end up affecting a future baby. I have always said I wouldn’t be able to put myself through IVF so I’m just in such a confused place right now.

Any ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/1d0zk52/husband_has_heterozygous_deletion_6q15q161_32_mb/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9960579872131348

Self pay test that healthcare professionals will take seriously?,"Based on running raw 23andme data through some databases, I believe my husband may have Lynch Disorder, which increases his chances of cancer.  However he does not meet the criteria to have a genetic test done professionally through the healthcare system (no family members with known cancer, no one in the family to have the syndrome).

I am willing to self-pay for a genetic test assuming it is reasonable.  I see there are whole genome sequencing tests out there for around $600-$1000.  Is there a specific test that healthcare professionals will take seriously if I brought in and which insurance will accept?  For example, if I self pay for a genetic test at X, I would like my husband be able to bring the results to his doctor and insurance and be able to qualify for more/earlier screening.  Can I get this done?  What company would be best?

Newborn Screen Elevated C5OH,"My son’s newborn screening revealed elevated C5OH (1.37 micromol/L, normal <1.15). Upon further testing his blood levels still indicated elevated C5OH levels with negative presence of urine analytes. Because of this, current doctors claim he is either a carrier or asymptomatic for possible conditions but do not seem confident in their prognosis because they are puzzled by the absence of analytes. They said they can’t even diagnose his condition and the cheek swab they could offer to potentially sequence his gene (dna? I don’t remember) is only 60% accurate.  

I am a layperson only equipped with google to understand what this means. We will likely not be seen for 8+ months and I’m very concerned for my son who is 4 weeks old. I do not know what symptoms to look for or what I should be concerned about if something arises.

Array CGH for Jacobsen syndrome?,"My sister is autistic along with a myriad of other disabilities both physical and not. She had a FISH array CGH many years ago which concluded a 16p11.2 duplication. 
I recently read about Jacobsen Syndrome (deletions of chromosome 11) and gosh does it sound like her, albeit similar symptoms to the 16p11.2 duplication. Symptoms like: autism, frequent ear and sinus infections, digestive system and  kidney problems, delayed development of speech and motor skills, intermittent divergent squints, low platelets), dysmorphic facial features like droopy eyes,  urethral stenosis and frequent urinary problems, chronic constipation, insensitivity to pain. 
Interestingly also linked to abnormal white matter on the brain which, although my sister doesn’t have, my mum (who my sister inherited the chromosome 16 abnormality from) has periventricular white matter lesions on her frontal lobe which following an unrelated operation & adverse reaction to anaesthetic has left her severely disabled. 

My mum said she had an array CGH which looked at all her chromosomes so she can’t have it. Looking at her report, I read it to mean they only looked at chromosome 16? As in, it couldn’t have picked up abnormalities on other chromosomes? I know they only tested me and my parents for the duplication my sister has so they wouldn’t have tested anything else for us so unsure if the array they’re referring to is the one they did on us? 

She has honestly got so many problems with quite literally every body part at this point so would be interesting to know if there could be other abnormalities hidden away in her genes 😅 ",https://i.redd.it/dlub2rcww0tc1.jpeg,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9977695941925049

Could someone help me understand the effect of homozygous M34T GJB2 Mutation and it's role in nonsyndromic hearing loss?,"Hello,

I recently completed a 23 and me test which was mostly unsurprising. However, I discovered that I have a homozygous variant on the GJB2 gene. This is the M34T variant. My understanding is that the fact this is a variant means that this is a 'variation' within a gene, basically an allele, is that correct? Does this mean then that I've inherited two copies of this variation from each parent, meaning both were at least carriers?

&#x200B;

I've found conflicting information online about whether or not this actually causes problems too. Some sources seem to think this can cause problems in a dominant pattern, most seem to think it's recessive and some seem to think that any combination doesn't cause issues. Can someone explain the current consensus on this please?

Low risk NIPT with no result for monosomy x,"I recently got my results from the Natera Panorama test. Everything says low risk, but for monosomy x, it says no result. The report reads, “No results on one or more chromosomes. A repeat specimen may be considered. The quality of data on one or more chromosomes is not sufficient to give a result. This is likely to be specific to this sample.” I’m including a link to an image of the report. 

My doctor hasn’t given me any information, I’ve only talked to admin staff at the clinic, and they just said the doctor would have me repeat the test. I have a call scheduled with a Natera genetic counselor on Monday. 

I’m really having a hard time finding anyone else who had a similar NIPT report as mine, and I’m hoping to understand what this could mean. I’ve seen many people get an “atypical findings” result with no result for monosomy x, but as you can see, mine does not say atypical anywhere on the report. However, from what I have read and what others have suggested, this no result is not good, and I will likely get another no result when they repeat the test, which means something is more likely to be wrong. 

I will add that on the same day my sample was taken for the NIPT, they ran some other blood tests, but it shows the tests were unable to be completed due to “marked hemolysis” and another was unable to be completed due to a clotted sample. I’m not sure if that could have affected this sample or not. 

ETA: I’ve already posted about this in the the NIPT subreddit. I’m just looking for other opinions.

My question is that do I have to have any clinical training such as a prelim year to qualify for these programs? Is there anyone here that has gone from pathology to clinical genetics?

ARHGEF1 Heterozygous,"Hi there! I’m looking for opinions and experience here, not diagnostics. I just want to know what you all think before bringing my idea to my doctor. 

***Background Info***
I’ve had significant immunodeficiency symptoms since I was an infant. Constant respiratory infections, skin infections, pneumonia, chicken pox 3 times (confirmed by lab), UTIs, pleurisy, all before the age of 18. By the time I graduated highschool I had the diagnosis of CVID, but my expression has always been atypical at best. 

IgA/IgG low, but IgG fluctuates wildly at times, I’ve never been in the “normal” range. I also have low IgM, but not as significantly as with IgA or IgG. I have very low function of my NK cells, my T cells counts range fairly high and it’s thought it’s due to dysregulation, and my B cells don’t Mature adequately (low switched memory B cells, high naive B cells, low plasmablasts) . 

Due to this abnormal expression I had genetic testing done (both an immunodeficiency panel (invitae) and WES (genedx), and I had two VUS pop up, both heterozygous and recessive, so we mostly ignored those and moved on.

Recently it was brought up again, and upon looking at the literature I realized that one of those recessive conditions describes my condition perfectly, the paper could have been written about me and virtually nothing would have to change. The only issue is that my mutation is heterozygous. [Immunodeficiency 62](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/1673905) is a far better fit for my symptoms than CVID. 

***QUESTIONS:***
Given how rare this condition appears to be, is it possible that cases of partial expression have just not been described in the literature? Is this worth bringing to my doctor? Or will it just make me look clueless and paranoid?

I’ve considered trying to apply for the NIH undiagnosed patient program to get a thorough analysis. I know it’s hard to get in, but I’m not sure if it may not be the only way to get something like this looked in to.

Lay-person wondering about clinical utility and limitations of Invitae’s Connective Tissue Panel,"Hello everyone, 

I am a lay-person with a background in biochemistry and some mid-level undergrad genetics experience. My undergrad was a few years ago now so I am a somewhat rusty.

I am wondering about the utility and limitations of Invitae’s Connective Tissue Panel from a clinical perspective. It tests for quite a few genes associated with various HDCT (but of course not all as there are over 200 heritable connective tissue disorders and of course hEDS does not have a genetic marker). 

The assay information states that for most of the genes it takes into account both sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis. There are some exons where this is not available however. So there are testing limitations but I am not sure how this would translate to a clinical situation. I know Marfan syndrome, for example, one could meet the systemic criteria without having an FBN1 mutation.

Invitae also provides information for additional variants of unknown significance. How useful is this in a clinical setting? Does it often just lead to misinformed patients being overly concerned?

"Question about genetics, skeletal development, hormone exposure in gestation.","I have searched high and low and I cannot find anything related to my question. I have even discussed the issue with Phd in anthropology and they did not have an answer. If an adult male discovers that they have a female skeleton, verified by the pelvis, spine, what does this infer? This would suggest some kind of intersex issue or chromosome issue to me, extra, mutations in SRY for example.

I do not understand when the skeletal structure form is locked in to place due to hormone exposure. It is my understanding that early in gestation there is an exposure to sex hormones and this is what determines skeletal structures. If that is true, how can a man develop female skeletal structures?

A Reddit poster familiar with the skeletal structures stated that pre-puberty the pelvis of males and females is indistinguishable. If that is true, wouldn't the pelvis then form based upon either testosterone or estrogen as puberty kicks in? If that is the case, how can a male with testes have a female pelvis and spine?

I read somewhere that the default structures of the skeleton, brain, and so on, will be the default if no testosterone is in the system. That makes sense to me. What does not make sense is how testosterone is present and yet the skeletal structures are female unless it is locked in early in gestation so later exposure has no effect.

Is it possible that low testosterone exposure early in gestation is the same as no testosterone? If so, that would make sense. It does not make sense post-puberty.

Can anyone enlighten or point to a book or texts that define how this works?",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/svh3qu/question_about_genetics_skeletal_development/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.99947589635849
Diagnosis of EDMD2,"I made a post before asking about LGMD in our 2 year old and people were very helpful. Her panel has now come back as EDMD2. In terms of her prognosis her doctor expressed his concern that while she doesn’t have contractures she does have significant weakness of her girdle which generally is one of the last things to kick in.

He referred to the mutation as being rare LMNA c.1583C>G; p.Thr528Arg (het). I’ve only found a couple of papers on it. Is there a way to get an idea of how many people have it? Does a mutation at a specific point generally predict roughly the same course and severity of disease for everyone who has it, or can it still vary greatly from person to person?

Question about GC Applicant Job Roles,"Hello!

I am a non-traditional prospective  genetic counseling student looking for relevant roles I can lend my  talents to while working towards grad school. I earned a degree in  Biology in 2010 and focused my early career on work experiences  initially in veterinary medicine and later on in international  development. While I gained great experiences in skills in these  previous career paths, when I discovered Genetic Counseling I just knew  it was the field for me! I also realized that the skills I gained  previously are extremely transferable to the field. I have spent the  past several months gathering information about the field and setting up  experiences related to the field that I can speak to on my school  applications. Now the last big piece to fall into place is to find a  paid position relevant to the GC world that I can lend my talents to  while I work my way towards graduate school.  I’ve looked at a few job  descriptions and believe I would be a good fit for clinical coordinator  type roles.  I am open to other role ideas as well (working in a  fertility clinic would also be interesting!), but I thought it may be  best to start with genetic research so I can become as immersed as  possible in the field. Is anyone aware of anyone in their networks  recruiting for these types of roles that I could reach out to?

GC as a Second Career,"Hey All,

I'm trying to figure out how to best get back on the path towards becoming a GC. This is long so TL;DR - I have been working with adults with IaDDs for 6 years now, but haven't practiced hard science in just as long.  I've never taken the GRE. GPA was about 3.0 but 3.2 for sciences during my BA. I'm worried my academic career is too far behind me, or wasn't strong enough to begin with, and am wondering if I would need to do a post-bacc. I'm also wondering if the additional debt is worth the lifestyle change.

Academic Background:I graduated from Sarah Lawrence undergrad back in 2013. They don't have majors but I focussed on pre-health areas, got most pre-reqs done (didn't get to orgo and biochem, also barely got a B in stats) and my science GPA was about 3.2. I didn't graduate on time (I had a rough senior year and got a couple Incompletes, though not in relevant courses). To compensate for my last couple credits, I did an independent study in AmeriCorps at a Camphill Village, working/living with adults with IaDDs. I then did another year of AmeriCorps doing nonprofit leadership training while working as a teen program coordinator for a YMCA. After that I enrolled in Orgo at a community college and was actually acing it, but had to withdraw because I got a job, so that's a W.

Currently:I got a job as the residential manager for a reputable supported living program for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. I constantly counsel and deescalate my clients, advocate for them, and help them manage all aspects of their lives. I do everything from working closely with their doctors, families, and social workers, to managing their benefits and navigating their employment opportunities. Since the pandemic I've directly helped one of them recover from Covid in the dignity and comfort of her home while maintaining the health and safety of the other 20 in the 5 homes I manage. And of course I manage and constantly train 14 staff on serving our residents in a person-centered manner.

I really like what I do, and the pay has gotten to the point that it's competitive with that of Genetic Counseling. The main reason I'm considering the switch is for the potential of better work-life balance (residential services operate/I am on-call 24/7, I make my schedule around the needs of the program, so it's different every day, and working weekends and holidays is in the job description). The older I get the more it wears on me. My wife can also work remotely now, indefinitely. I know there are companies that allow the same for GCs. My dream would be to get a cheap house in a pretty area and travel/work remotely (post pandemic of course).

I've been out of academia for 7 years but know I have excellent advocacy skills and the ability to teach information to anyone on any level and connect them to resources. I also know my scientific aptitude and passion is still there, I just don't remember much.

The Cancer Communication Research Lab at the University of South Florida is looking for participants and their partners to participate in a research study. The purpose of the study is to develop a list of questions and prompts that patients and partners can use in their conversations and ultimately help them communicate their priorities and values about family building.

To be eligible to participate in this study, you must meet the following criteria. You:

(1) are between the ages of 18 to 39 years old;

(2) have received positive genetic test results that predispose you to cancer (e.g., Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer, Lynch, Familial Adenomatous Polyposis, Cowdens, Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, Li-Fraumeni);

(3) have a partner who is also willing to participate in the study and are currently cohabitating with that partner;

(4) have not completed your family building (i.e., either through biological means, adoption, or surrogacy); and

(5) are currently living in the United States.

By participating in this research study, you will each be compensated up to $180 if you complete all phases of the study.

If you are interested in participating, please contact the Study Coordinator Jonathan Baker at [cancercomm@usf.edu](mailto:cancercomm@usf.edu) for further information.",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/fpm145/research_study_genetic_cancer_risk_family/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9688847661018372
Mutations and Disease After Birth,"Recently, the mention of ""causes damage to your DNA"" has been more frequent in regards to the poisonous effect of toxins.  While researching a presumably-very-minor problem with the body, one otherwise-sensible result is something caused by a gene mutation which causes that gene to be nonfunctional.  Normally, we would assume such a condition to always be present at birth.  However, is there ANY such thing as a toxin, which causes damage to a gene, which now creates that same conditiom or disease because the gene was damaged or mutated after birth?

Is the problem ""damage to your DNA"" the cause of this, is that what that mention means?  If not, then why is ""damage to your DNA"" a result that would make it extremely important to avoid that substance?

The answer to the first paragraph is, at that particular exact moment, more of the answer I need to know now.

Need help understanding In-cis VS in-trans R117H/5T,"Hello everyone,

I hope I am posting in the right category, please let me know if that’s not the case or if my question is completely off topic. I have been trying to get more information on my situation and it’s been pretty hard.

I am a 35 years old male. I have been diagnosed recently with R117H/5T and my report mentions that investigation or my parents would be required to determine if in-trans (responsible for CAVD mainly which I suffer from), or in-cis (more CF related disease). My sister was diagnosed a few years on a completely unrelated investigation with R117H:17T. (7T heterozygous). This information leads me to believe that my mutation would be in-trans since she would also be 5T if it was in-cis? Is that a good assumption or am I completely mistaken?

For context, we have no history of CF in my family as far we remember, and I have never had any symptoms associated with CF like lung of pancreas issues.

Apologies for asking this question here, I have been awaiting for a counsellor appointment for 4 months now and my file is still in triage, I might have to wait for a while and would like to understand my situation a bit more.

Positive test RS1137070 - autism likelihood?,"We recently had an independent lab perform a genetic screening on our 1 month old son simply to understand more about possible later-in-life health issues. The test came back positive for (among several hundred other results for various things) him being homozygous for gene MOA T1410C, RS1137070, client TT, & Minor T. 

I don’t know what any of this means, however the test laboratory notated these results are consistent with increased MOA activity and associated with autism, depression, and schizophrenia. 

My question is, how likely is it, based on these results alone, that my son will be autistic? Is this test result a major indication that he will develop autism, or is it likely this is just one of many different factors that contribute to autism?

Seeking career advice from genetic counselors,"Hello! I am about to be a senior in college, and will graduate with a degree in Human Physiology and a minor in Biology. A career in genetic counseling sounds perfect for me, as it combines biology and clinical counseling - two areas in which I have both academic and volunteering experience. 

However, I am concerned that there is little opportunity for salary growth. Being financially comfortable enough that I can afford decent housing and (eventually) support children is extremely important to me. The national median salary seems to be around 72k, which is below the livable wage of many areas that have the highest concentration of GC jobs. I am wondering if this figure does indeed reflect the pay that genetic counselors out there actually receive, and if there are ways to advance your career and increase your compensation. For example, would it be possible to open your own private practice? Or are there specific specialties or additional certifications that could improve your pay? 

I am not concerned with being especially wealthy, but I do plan on supporting family members and do not want to face financial hardship.

Important things to look for when choosing school for undergrad?,"Hi all,

I’m going into my senior year and I’m starting to seriously look at colleges.  Right now my first choice is University of South Carolina, but most of the reasons I like the school don’t have to do with its academics.  From what I can tell, it’s a good school (as most state colleges are), but it’s not nationally known or anything for biology fields (what I plan to major in).  They have genetics classes, but not a genetics major.

Right now I’m pretty sure I want to pursue being a genetic counselor.  I was wondering if anyone had some insight on what I should look for when choosing a school for my undergrad degree, since the field is getting more competitive.  Does anyone know if USC has a decent biology program, and will it look fine when applying for grad school?  Is there anything else I should look for when looking for schools?

I’m just not sure what I should be looking for, so any advice would be appreciated!  I really like everything else about USC, but I don’t want to go there if it doesn’t bode well for my future endeavor in genetic counseling.

What are my chances of getting into a Genetic Counseling program?,"I've been premed all throughout my undergrad, but lately, I've been interested in other career options, mainly genetic counseling. But before I dig deeper into this, I'd like to know where I stand. I have a BS in psychology and minored in biology (graduated summa cum laude, Phi Beta Kappa), and have taken all the premed prerequisites. I've done wet lab research in an orthopedics lab for 3 years and did my own senior thesis project with this lab, and I worked for a genetic counselor for 1 year as a clinical research assistant. I've shadowed her and have gotten a general sense of what genetic counselors do. I've tutored children at an elementary school, tutored college athletes who were taking chemistry and biology, volunteered at the Children's Hospital for 2.5 years, and volunteered as a wish granter for Make-a-Wish for 3 years (I kept in touch with one family throughout those 3 years, helping their child come up with a wish and then working with the organization to work out the logistics of making that wish eventually come true as of this past summer). I'm currently taking a gap year now, and I'm working as a medical scribe for a family doctor and a nurse practitioner in pediatrics. 

So up to this point, if I just take the GRE and make sure I've taken all the courses most programs require, what are my chances of getting into a Genetic Counseling program?

I absolutely love genetics and want to do something involving genetics for my career.  However, I am not a straight A student.  Its not that I don't care, its that I find studying to be very difficult for me.  I am just not good at it.  My grades are fine (As and Bs) and my GPA is around 3.5.  But this semester has been really tough for me and I'm afraid my GPA will start dropping, despite my best efforts.  I have started volenteering in a lab, but I'm not doing anything major yet (just computer work).  I also have an interview set up with a crisis line to hopefully start volenteering there.  i know these are all positives, but theres one major issue I have and that is that I have low vision and I'm colorblind.  I have a genetic disorder affecting my eyes that is not correctable.  My vision is 20/160.  I am really worried that grad schools or employers will see this and shy away because they don't want to be liable for me making a mistake because of my vision (even though I've never had problems doing most things).

Fragile X premutation to full mutation risks question,"Hello, I was reviewing an [article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10897-005-4802-x) regarding Fragile X expansion and wanted some clarification on communication of risks to concerned families. Let's say a woman with 75 repeats in *FMR1* presents to clinic and asks, ""What's the chance of having a son with the full mutation?""

Looking at the table from [Nolin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC379237/) that is shown in the previous article, it says the chance of expansion for someone with 70-79 repeats is 31.10%, which appears to be the observed ratio of the sample. I imagine at the very least, you would factor in the 50% chance that she would have a son, making it a 15.55% risk (0.311 x 0.5 =0.1555).

The part I'm getting hung up on, is would you then factor in an additional 50% risk of passing on the X that carries the premutation (0.311 x 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.07775)? Or am I overcomplicating things? Any thoughts would be much appreciated. I just want to make sure I'm understanding how to use the table presented by Nolin.

Deciding on Additional Valuable Classes or the Value of Additional Classes to Prepare for Applying to GC Programs,"Hello!

I have been spending the past 2 years picking up prereqs for GC programs, as I earned my BA with a double major in Psych and Arabic Studies, which is not so heavy on the sciences. I have excellent grades, lots of teaching/crisis counseling/research/mentoring experiences, and a decent GRE to contribute to my application. I have also had some pseudo shadowing experiences and will be shadowing more this spring. What I am lacking, however, is an extensive repertoire of science classes. 

Right now I have the following prereq/science classes:
- 1 undergraduate and 4 graduate level statistics (one class was statistical genomics through the public health graduate program at my school)
- research methods 1 & 2
- psych classes (elementary, social, personality, abnormal, physiological)
- basic biology 1 & 2 (with lab)
- basic chemistry 1 & 2 (with lab)
- organic chemistry (no lab-they combine 1 and 2 labs together so I don’t know if I should be pursuing an alternative option for this)
- biochemistry (no lab offered)
- fundamental genetics
- Honors Chemistry (for non-majors - titled: the molecules of life: DNA, Disease)
- Cognitive Neuroscience (not entirely related but still an upper level science class)

I have As in all of the classes that I listed, but I know I am lacking in biology and genetics courses. Some schools require or recommend anatomy/physiology, cell/molecular biology, embryology/developmental bio, and/or any upper level genetics classes. I am pretty limited on the upper level genetics classes available to me (molecular sounds like it might be the best although there is a heavy emphasis on testing techniques/technologies). There is a molecular genetics of human disease class offered through the anthropology department and a human genetics and public health class offered through the graduate school of public health. The real problem is that I am pretty broke. I have been paying for all my prereqs out of pocket since graduating and loans/financial aid are not really an option unless I want to take out private loans, which I’d really like to avoid. I am working almost full time right now and taking a couple of classes, but working for $12/hr barely pays for my living expenses and the 4 credits I’m taking. 

I guess what I am asking, is what I should really be focusing on/doing or is there a better way to go about picking up a few more classes to help me out that I can do while working full time this summer/fall? I am really aiming to be able to apply by fall 2019 and I don’t want to waste time/money on more courses if they are at all unnecessary.

"Not competitive for GC school, seeking alternatives","Simply put, I'm not a competitive applicant for GC school.
I have other interests I've been pursuing (mostly unsuccessfully). Most of these interests have paths that could naturally lead to GC in the future, but I have not ""always wanted to be a genetic counselor""

* I did terribly in my foundation courses in undergrad. I believe I had undiagnosed depression, systemic illness, ADHD, or DSPS. I am not currently diagnosed or in treatment for any of those, but I have seen a behavioral health student counselor a few years ago and have basically treated myself as having anxiety and ADHD and it's changed my life drastically. Plus, and I'm not at all trying to humblebrag, I hadn't learned how to study. Since undergrad I have improved at least 10x as a student, but haven't really had access to more challenging curriculum to prove myself. And even now, I've gotten some B's since turning my life around. 

* I am in my early 30s. I cannot afford to spend too much time shadowing and volunteering as it is, and especially have to limit myself if this is a pipe dream in which its completely too late.

* I don't see myself being competitive for financial support. In fact, financially, I'd have to scale back from seeking full-time work to make room for shadowing, spend a few application cycles applying, then probably living long distance with my partner with two sets of living expenses. So financially I don't think this is a wise career path for me. But if there's a real chance I could start school within 3 years, that may make it doable.

That said, I can't seem to give up on the idea of this. Any idea how someone who is not going to be a competitive applicant can do similar work? There doesn't seem to be a standard ""assistant/technician"" level position like you would see with occupational health or physical therapy or a clinical lab science. 

I am considering trying to go the MLT-MLS (cyto, genetic, mol D) route into clinical genetics, but I really am attracted to the GC field. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/ClinicalGenetics/comments/7j5uqx/not_competitive_for_gc_school_seeking_alternatives/,ClinicalGenetics,-0.9857078194618225

Need some genetic counseling resources on dealing with patients who have a history of suicide attempts,"Not sure where to ask this, so I will attempt to do so here. I am a relatively new genetic counselor, and I have a particularly difficult case coming in soon. The patient has attempted suicide at least once in recent years, has a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and still has suicidal ideations now. Her genetics evaluation is for an unrelated health issue, which is debilitating but not life-threatening (at least as far as we know without testing being done). She is being seen by mental health professionals, so I don't believe there are any referrals needed. However, I am concerned about this patient's possible reactions if we do indeed perform genetic testing and a positive result came back that had medical implications. So to finally get to my question, does anyone know any good resources I could read to help prepare for the unique psychosocial issues that could come up with this case, specifically for suicidal patients?

Posting advice online,"GC's and GC students- please stop posting advice online. Students, especially, need to refrain from providing advice given that their training is still incomplete. This includes interpreting results, posting general risk assessments, providing follow up recommendations after someone has seen a GC in real life and needs more help, etc.

Without seeing a person's medical or family history information in front of you, and more importantly without having interacted with them, it’s not appropriate for us to make these assessments. We, better than anyone, know how nuanced genetic counseling cases are when considering the complete medical and social context- there’s a high chance that the information you’re providing is inappropriate for the person’s situation when it’s based on incomplete information about the situation. 

It’s distasteful for our field from a professional perspective. I understand that the internet is an attractive platform to educate people and provide people with access to information they may otherwise not have. If this is an important goal for you, however, you should invest your efforts in making it a priority of NSGC (or other professional societies) to provide a vetted online service or make a SIG for online interaction with the public. The information we are disseminating via public platforms (like reddit) should reflect a unified message with vetted information.

One solution in the interim might be to redirect individuals to GARD to ask their questions. I’m sure others can think of different alternatives.

Embarrassing Question on Admissions,"Hi all,

I have a sincere question but I've been afraid to ask it of any students or faculty I've encountered because the question itself implies guilt and I don't want to hurt my chances of getting admitted.

I've read that most programs require drug testing at various points. I am curious about the timing of all of this. I've applied to several out of state programs and the logistics could be complicated. 

So what's the deal? Do I need to take the test shortly after accepting an offer? Will it be administered during an orientation when I start in the fall? Is testing something that only happens before clinical rotations or starting at a new hospital?

I've applied to a few brand new GC programs this year with the thought that established programs are quite competitive and that I may have better luck with a newer school.

I didn't think much of it until I spoke with a friend of mine that's a researcher. She strongly discouraged me from attending a brand new program and recommended I spend a year gaining more experience in order to make myself more likely to get into a more established program.

What are people's thoughts on this? I think she makes a great point--it makes a lot more sense, and I'd like to go somewhere with some name recognition and a fantastic track record.

Anxious about admissions.,"Hi all,

I've been feeling quite anxious about admissions and thought it might be a good idea to ask the community about it.

I graduated last year with a BS in biology have been working as an aide for children with autism and doing research for about a year.

My GPA is good (3.6), GRE is excellent (above 80% in all categories), but I can't help but feel the rest of my experiences are lacking. I've shadowed and interviewed many GCs but don't have experience working in laboratory genetics, don't have any published papers, and haven't worked on a crisis line or anything. 

I guess I'm concerned that I won't measure up to others and won't get in this cycle. It's been causing me a ton of anxiety and I'm not sure what to do.

Any advice on dealing with this? Can I get in with my current stats? What should I do for another year if I don't get in? Are there any new programs starting soon, and am I more likely to get into those?

Current stats and improving chances of getting into a program.,"Hi everyone,

I graduated last year with a biology degree and have since been wavering a lot on what I want to do. Thought I wanted to go to medical school, then become a nurse, and now looking into genetic counseling. I've talked to a few professors and it's looking like getting in is **very** competitive.

My current stats are as follows -- 

Undergraduate GPA -- 3.52, plus 60 units at CC w/ GPA of 4.00

Pre-requisite grades: 

Biochemistry -- C+

Genetics A/B -- B in each course

Statistics -- A+

Biology (full year) -- A in each course

Inorganic chemistry (full year) -- A in each course

Organic chemistry (full year) -- A in each course

Psychology (introduction, developmental) -- A in each course


Relevant experience: Teaching special education (middle school) -- 1 year; writing tutor (1 year); volunteering at the hospital (1 year)

I know chances aren't good for this cycle, but would love to hear how I'm doing now and what I can do from here on out to make myself a great candidate for a GC program.

Thanks so much in advance for any help!!

Best approach for assessing possible genetic causes for layered medical problems ,"My 21yo daughter has been going through hell the last couple of years.  For background - When she was 10 she had a stroke and they found a pilocytic astrocytoma in her brain, and subsequently had it removed.  She got really sick (hg) when she was pregnant.  And since then, it's just one diagnosis after the next. Irritable bowel, multiple liver hemangiomas, intestinal intususcception with tumor (awaiting surgery), pelvic congestion syndrome, possible endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome...it seems like everytime we go to the doctor it's something else.  So much of this is vascular - it just seems to me that there is likely an overriding issue yet to be identified. And it's sooo multi-systems!  Insurance won't cover genetic testing unless it's life threatening which is ridiculous.  But I'd like to pursue private pay options.  Prices are all over the place, reviews on sites are extremely mixed, and frankly I don't really know what she needs - and am having problems understanding the genetic world's language.

Recap: I'm blood type O+, my husband is type A+, and when my son was born the hospital told us his blood type was B+. I asked the hospital how that was possible and they fed us some dumb reply that many in this community said was total BS. 
Thank you all for your support, answers, advice, guidance, and general information. 
Here's what we did: all three of us got our blood tested to confirm the type. My son's records did reflect the B+ type, so we didn't misremember what the hospital told us. 
Here's the outcome: I'm O+, my husband is A+, and my son... drumroll please...is A+. We're having his medical records updated to reflect this new information.

“Superfemale gene” that causes male children to be miscarried?,"Hello! In the 1950s, my great grandmother was told she had a “superfemale gene” that caused her to miscarry males. Her twin brother also died in the womb. Googling “superfemale gene” gives me Trisomy X, which does not affect miscarriages as far as I’m aware. She never miscarried a girl (I believe she had three daughters) but every boy was miscarried. Since this was about 70 years ago, the doctors probably didn’t actually know what was going on. Is there actually a disorder that causes this, or was it purely coincidence?     
More info: She was about 5’2 and the father was 6’4. She has some symptoms of Trisomy X (sleep apnea, hip displacia, wide set eyes) and may have been bipolar. She was also Italian if that means anything. I never met her, so all this information is from what my mother remembers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/177rden/superfemale_gene_that_causes_male_children_to_be/,genetics,-0.9942917823791504

Genetic disorder Noonan syndrome,"My baby was born with Noonan syndrome. The genetic tests done during pregnamcy did not show any disorder. I had a very difficult pregnancy- had 3 amnioreductions during the 3rd trimester but the one thing that i was sure of was that at least he did not have a genetic defect (since the tests were clear and we have no family history)
We found about Noonan's syndrome 1 week before the induction date (we had some advanced genetic testing done at a research institute). I was shattered. And i was angry. Baby was expected to have normal life expectancy (but not a normal life). I had an emergemcy c section and there he was- my bundle of joy. But soon after his heart and lymph issues flared uncontrollably. He passed away when he was 45 days old. In our arms (he was on life support since 10 days and doctors had given up hope).
He would have been 6 months old today.
I am still having anger outbursts (which is extremely unusual for me)
I miss him every day. He never came home. I never saw him without his breathing and feeding tubes. I dont know why I am posting this.

I’m a colorblind female,"I’m a colorblind female, but my dad is not colorblind. I was told this is “impossible” so I must have had a random mutation. What stumps me is that my brother is colorblind. It’s always seemed so weirdly coincidental to me that something so rare and random would happen to me when colorblindness actually legitimately runs in my family. Is there another explanation other than mine being spontaneous? 

And yes, my dad is 100% my dad 😅

ETA I noticed my toddler son seemed to be colorblind, so I did a little Punnett square which said 100% of my male children should be colorblind. He’s a little older now and definitely is. So I know the genetics are genetic-ing in that direction at least!

Can stress during conception or pregnancy cause genetic mutation in a baby?,"I’m sorry for the stupid question. But I’m at a very bad place at the moment and trying to figure out if I did anything wrong, even though if it is most probably just bad luck. 

My baby (first child) was diagnosed with an extremely rare (de novo) genetic mutation, of which only few hundred people in history had been affected. The syndrome will affect him both physicall and mentally. We don’t know if he’ll be able to life independently in the future. 

As the news has started to sink in, I started asking myself if we, the parents, have done anything wrong. We have been together for 13 years and barely fought. Yet the month we conceived the baby was our hardest time. Shouting at each other, perpetually fighting etc. We were both extremely stressful. That day, we had sex, not out of love, but because we had been trying for months. And came the baby. The ultrasounds detected short limbs yet we were totally ok with dwarfism, as what matters is mental health. 

I know the question is absurd but I feel guilty. Did we do anything wrong? Did we cause the mutation?",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/17j1135/can_stress_during_conception_or_pregnancy_cause/,genetics,-0.8946945667266846

Genetic mutation caused Mariam Nabatanzi (maama Uganda) to have 44 childeen.,"I'm sorry if this is not allowed, this is just a casual post.

I remember the first time saw her interview on YouTube.
By the age of 40, she already gave birth to 44 children (4 sets of twins, 5 sets of triplets, 5 sets of quadruplets and the only single birth on her last child).
Upon searching deeper, it said that she have ultra-rare genetic mutation that causes her to hyper ovulate and releasing multiple eggs in one cycle.

I never know this is possible.
It seems like she's still the only one and given a title as ""the most fertile woman in the world"".

What exactly determines your child’s skin tone? ,"I am a black person. I’m curious about this because within black families, it is possible for children to have different skin tones (dark skin, like Naomi Campbell… light skin, like Rihanna or Beyoncé, a skin tone that’s moreso in the middle which we call brown skinned.)

I know of a family wherein their eldest daughter is lightskinned (lighter than the average black person, like her father. Her mother is brown skinned - lighter than Naomi Campbell, darker than Rihanna or Beyoncé,) the second daughter is dark skinned (darker than both of her parents,) and the third child leans more toward being in the middle, closer to light than dark. The mother is in the middle, the father is light.  

But all of the family members have different complexions, and this happens a lot in black families. Why? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/1dar00n/what_exactly_determines_your_childs_skin_tone/,genetics,0.6265799403190613

Petition to Protect Genetic Information From Being Used For Insurance Purposes,"Hi, my name is Elizabeth and I am advocating for additional genetic information protections for BRCA mutation carriers and others holding genetic mutations that could be discriminated against by insurance companies. 

Here is the link for the petition: https://www.change.org/Protecting_genetic_information 

I encourage you to sign and share it. 

I have a strong family history of breast cancer so I decided when I was 35 to get genetic testing. I found out that I hold the BRCA2 mutation and was never informed by anyone that I would no longer be able to get life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance because of this pre-existing condition. Insurance carriers are allowed to discriminate and the federal GINA law does not provide protections against this. It has come to my attention that Florida is the first state pioneering these protections. I have included the link from facing our risk of cancer and powered (FORCE) which details in layman's terms the legislation.

https://www.facingourrisk.org/advocacy/advocacy-issues-detail.php?id=52#p7TP3c1_1

I am looking to advocate for similar legislation in Maryland and the rest of the country. I am going through the preventative surgeries to reduce my risk but that is still no guarantee that I will be able to get such coverage. I would be more than happy to talk with you about my personal experience and story if you would like.  Please sign and share this petition.

FDA approves first genetic test to identify opioid use addiction-Thoughts?,"
Genetic test for risk of opioid use disorder. The FDA approved the first genetic test that supposedly gauges the risks of developing opioid use disorder after being prescribed opioids for acute medical conditions.  I agree that opiate over prescribing and abuse is a serious issue, but I question whether this is an ethical way to address that concern. Seems like the FDA dropped the ball on oxycontin and this only further puts the blame on users and not the drugs themselves.  I imagine people supposedly predisposed to abuse by this kind of testing are also predisposed to other things like likelihood to be a long distance runner because of the endorphins released.  I personally find this appealing and hope this kind of testing never becomes widespread.  What's next testing candidates for a job or students for admission to a university, medical school, etc..  Reminds me of the movie Gattaca,  I think this technology could have really negative consequences if applied to different circumstances.  Thoughts?

My mother tells me a great granpa of mine had brown eyes, so that makes sense that i would have brown eyes too, but i also have epicanthic folds. I have not noticed this feature in any other of my family members. My grandma is from nothern ireland and other comments have revealed to me that sometimes irish people can have this feature so that could be why. I just feel a little uncertain about my history as i have now identified several features in myself not present in other family members. Should i get a DNA test?

Why might a genetic female have genetic data from a Y chromosome?,"So, as far as I know, I've got two X chromosomes. No one has ever told me otherwise, and I've had little reason to think otherwise.

I recently downloaded my raw AncestryDNA data, mostly out of curiosity. With AncestryDNA, each chromosome is labelled 1-26. Two alleles are shown for each rsID, one for each individual chromosome. 23 is the X chromosome, 24 is the Y chromosome, 25 is the pseudoautosomal regions, and 26 is mitochondrial DNA (I'm pretty sure).

I did read another post with a similar question on r/Genealogy. Another genetic female had 3 results under her chromosome 24 and wanted to know why. Most of her results under her chromosome 24 were 0, which I'm assuming indicates ""No Data"" or something similar, but she had 3 that were actual letters (A, C, G, or T). Someone wrote a great explanation talking about homology and paralogs between the X and Y chromosomes.

I have 58 results under my chromosome 24. I'm curious to learn more about why and how this happens, and how much the pseudoautosomal regions can get switched between the X and Y chromosomes. Especially *when* this switching happens, considering I've obviously never had a Y chromosome.

One of the Y chromosome readings gives a C on one allele and a T on the other. That one really confuses me, but it might just be a read error.

I also have more questions that have come out of my results. Nothing specific, just questions about the occurrence(s) of insertions and deletions and things of that nature. I'll put those in a separate post.

EDIT: Before anyone asks, I did not count the 58 results by hand. I used Excel, and I'm working on seeing the amount of insertions, deletions, and ""No Data"" markers I have for all of the data.

EDIT 2: Many people are mentioning the possibility of this happening if I’ve ever had a male child. I have never had children and I’m not currently pregnant, nor was I when I took the test.

EDIT 3: To everyone suggesting AIS or Klinefelter’s but phenotypically female, I’ve had an ultrasound of my reproductive system. It’s all fine and normally sized.

Wish I never got a genetics test,"I decided to get a genetics test from Nebula based on advertising and comments from others saying it was a good idea. A Substack writer I read recommended it saying how great it is to have your genetic information at your disposal. I didn't know what I thought I would be getting out of it, but it certainly wasn't what I saw. Apparently, I have a high susceptibility to three different types of cancers and a liver disease. None of the variants are ""pathogenic"", but I guess based on the number of variants I have associated with things that may cause cancer it says I am in the 90th percentile or higher for all of these things.

My $1000 genetics lab,"http://imgur.com/a/SZ0KV

I go to an older medical school in Philadelphia with not much research going on. I used to work in genetics and I miss it! Im trying to raise an interest in the field at my school because I really feel that precision medicine is the future of medicine. My dean gave me the keys to one of our old abandoned labs and an absurd $1000 budget. I've spent the last few weeks cleaning it out and acquiring the bare basics for the least amount of money I can. The goals of my genetics lab are humble: to have the ability to extract, purify, and quantify DNA. All sequencing and informatics will be taken care of at a local core facility. A lot of the equipment is very old, but it was donated and beggars cant be choosers. 
Heres what I've got so far:

Beckman Spectrophotometer... I miss my old labs Nanodrop :(
15mL Centrifuge  
Microfuge 
-80C Freezer (Broken.. trying to repair)
Micropipettes and tips 
transilluminator 
Gel chambers 
Thermocycler (seems to cycle, havent had a chance to run a PCR to test)
Fridge / Freezer combo

Hoping to be up and running soon! We cant afford spit kits and all the buccal cell mouthwash protocols seem to be yielding poor quality DNA.

Sex determination is fascinating,"Lately I’ve gone deep into the biology behind sex determination mainly in humans and one thing for sure is that it definitely isn’t simple by any means!

Most people know that women have XX chromosomes and men have XY chromosomes which determine their sex but how they actually do it is quite fascinating. Here’s what I’ve compiled from my research into this matter also I’m just doing this out of interest and I’m mainly summarizing stuff. I’m no expert by any means just a simple layman exploring.

1. ) Turns out that when it comes to sex determination autosomes are also involved although sex chromosomes are needed they also are involved with tasks that sometimes have nothing to do with sex determination(mainly the X chromosome). Sex chromosomes kind of act like catalysts for sex determination which activate other genes either on it or on other chromosomes to start the processes of sex determination. So in all of our autosomes and sex chromosomes(since the X is shared) we pretty much share genes for both male and female development and how they are expressed is dependent on the sex chromosomes. Ironically some genes necessary for male development are also located on the X chromosome in fact genes for androgen receptors are only located the X while genes related to Estrogen receptors are on autosomes. So in a weird twist of fate men only have one gene for androgens whilst women have two! There is also dosage compensation in women here is a video [Dosage compensation in women](https://youtu.be/BD6h-wDj7bw) for that since I’m too tired to write.

2. ) The peculiar case of the Y chromosome. The Y chromosomes unlike its counterpart X is very small, around 1/3 the size of the X and is composed of “junk DNA” that code for nothing but help prevent it’s degeneration. It is the only non-recombining part of the human genome unless you include Mtdna but that’s different. The evolution of it is also very cool here is a video [Evolution of Y chromosome ](https://youtu.be/29sNmFGh07s) detailing it. Basically an autosome acquired a sex determining locus which made the animal male and that had to be preserved and that lead to the degeneration of the Y in order to conserve this. Although the X and Y look vastly different in terms of content today they both were identical pairs of autosome that split of due to one of them acquiring a sex determining locus.

3. ) The female gender is “default” in mammals as well as other animal species. Ok, this one was the weirdest thing about sex determination I learned about that in mammals due to the XY determination the “female” sex is default. The primary reason is because both men and women have an X chromosome which leads to an initial female phenotype and that changes when you add the Y chromosome. It is also something it take with a grain of salt since initially fetuses are essentially sexless for that matter but it does seem to follow the “female template”. I would say so as well but one that thing that kind of argues against the neutral standing is condition called Turner syndrome where an individual has only a single X chromosome which leads to a female phenotype and genotype as well. Most of the time it’s usually women who have Turner syndrome but in some cases it also happens to men if the Y gets deleted or doesn’t work the way it should. Also nobody has been born with only a Y chromosome or two YY’s or they dead for that matter since too many essential genes will be lost. The X chromosome generally leads to a female phenotype unless it is regulated by a Y chromosome in males and things can go wrong if the Y doesn’t function properly.

Now people always misinterpret this notion that the female sex is “default” the only reason it is this way and even for a very brief period of time is due to the absence of Y chromosome or non-activation of it in males for a that period of time. Even if the female sex is default we still have genes for male development as I said earlier in fact both men snd women share sex related genes in autosomes equally but the Y chromosome just happens to be the catalyst that kick starts male development. There is so much pseudoscience and political nonsense behind this so I advise against looking into anything non-scholarly on this as you might run into an ongoing war of the sexes online lol. It honestly doesn’t change much.

4. ) Sex determination in other animals is far different than the mammalian norm and here is an article [Sex determination ](sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/im-xy-know-sex-determination-systems-101/) and video [Sex determination ](https://youtu.be/kMWxuF9YW38) for that since I’m too tired to write further.

I’m a tetragametic chimera - which of my numerous medical issues could be the result of this?,"Edit: I guess in the grand scheme of things there’s a lot of explanations for this stuff. Thank you all for your input, it’s been enlightening. I’m the furthest thing from an expert on the topic, which is why I’m asking questions, providing what information I already have and am lined up to see a councilor. Hopefully they help me sort this stuff out. Thank you again for the help, I appreciate it!

 Apparently I’m a 30something year old chimera person. A series of DNA tests and some good ol fashioned physical evidence says so. I’m on a waiting list to speak to a genetic councilor in my area, but in the meantime hoped maybe I could get a bit of input from you all. I’m also happy to answer any questions you have, to the best of my ability. Ive dealt with an extensive series of physical and mental issues my whole life and am wondering which of these is likely directly related to killing and eating my twin brother and gaining his apparently really lackluster powers.

Physical chimera-teristics:

- I have heterochromia AND heterochromia iridium (one blue eye, one green and brown eye)
- Born visibly intersex
- Ambidextrous 
- two hair whorls (I didn’t know this was a thing but my doctor mentioned it 🤷‍♂️)

Other factors:
- During my mother’s pregnancy, two heartbeats were detected around the second trimester, and a second ‘shadow’ was visible on their old-timey sonogram machine. The second heartbeat and shadow had disappeared by the final pre-delivery evaluation. When I was born, the placenta was apparently very large.

Physical Medical stuff:
- As mentioned above, I was born intersex. Nonfunctional external male part was removed at birth. I assume this is a fairly obvious ‘yes’ in terms of whether or not it has to do with being a chimera. 

- I have Lynch syndrome and have had endometrial cancer, plus a lifetime of very large, very nasty cysts in and around my reproductive organs. 

- Severe digestive issues.

- Extremely poor eyesight. One eye can’t see up-close very well, the other can’t see far away very well. 

- Weak tooth enamel/underdeveloped teeth. 

- Fluctuate between hypo- and hyperthyroidism. 

Mental garbage:

- Extreme physical/sexual dysphoria. As a little kid, even though I guess I was primarily born female, I didn’t understand that I was ‘a girl’ and would try to pee standing/do a lot of very stereotypical ‘little boy’ things. Disclaimer - yes, even though interests shouldn’t be gender-conforming, I will mention mine were all very boy-activities.

- I’m very bisexual, with a physical urge to ‘top’ despite not having the junk to do it with. I remember a great deal of confusion during sexual maturity, and extreme feelings of depression/anxiety/inadequacy in regard to sexual performance. 

- Phantom dick. It’s there but it’s not. I don’t know how else to describe it.

- My ‘body map’ and my physical body don’t match up. I have disorientation when it comes to touching my own body, and don’t have a constant mental picture of what my face looks like. Looking in the mirror and touching my body always feels like looking at / touching another person.

- My immediate feelings toward something can be directly contradictory. I’ve definitely loved/hated something at the same time, and felt both feelings absolutely (not in a ‘oh I have mixed feelings about this’ sense. Again, I don’t know how to describe it. I had to mentally negotiate with myself sometimes to decide which way to feel about something because I know feeling two ways about the same thing is frustrating to friends/family).

I know there’s more, I’ll add them as I remember. Please help me understand what I am exactly and how much of this is to blame for some of the harder parts of existing.

Breastfeeding confirmed addiction gene?,"I once read a study on the addiction gene. It said people with the addiction gene with alcohol they release oxytocin the love horome when drinking. I always talked about that giddy excited feeling that came over me when I had a drink or two which was the main reason I drank before having a child. I always said I'd never touch drugs because I have an addictive personality and I know I'd really struggle. My dad has addiction to gambling and cola.. I know and his mum had alcohol addiction. 

So this brings me to breastfeeding, when you are feeding you get a 'let down' where the milk comes out faster this happens every feed when they are young, the horome oxytocin is released at that point and its the exact, absolutely no different feeling to how I felt when I drank alcohol, to the point it made me crave alcohol so intensely. 

Anyone heard of anything like this and anything I can do to help myself? Because the urge to drink is strong but I work on limiting it to one glass a week, but its frustrating wanting to drink often for that feeling.

Also forgot to add, if my let down wasn't coming and I wanted it to as the baby was hungry I'd imagine drinking a cold glass of prosecco or something and it would come straight away. I also didn't enjoy the oxytocin release feeling with breastfeeding but I enjoy the feeling when I'm drinking alcohol. (Just to clarify I don't do both at the same time lol)",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/17zjbii/breastfeeding_confirmed_addiction_gene/,genetics,-0.969867467880249

You don't get 50% of your DNA from each parent... if you're a man,"I was thinking about this the other day and was kind of in disbelief but it's really true and the reason is because of the XY karyotype we carry. The only difference between men and women is the sex chromosomes and only that and since the Y is the smaller of the two sex chromosomes it means you technically inherit more DNA from your mom if you're a guy. Women on the other hand pretty much get exactly 50% of their DNA from either parent because they have two homologous X chromosomes.

Dosage compensation takes care of any issues related to sex chromosome expression so both sexes are fine most of the time. I also left out the **mitochondrial DNA** which everyone only gets from their mom but nuclear DNA is pretty much what gives us our phenotype.

Edit: As a Redditor pointed out we don't actually inherit more DNA from our mom it's just less DNA from our dad (Y chromosome).",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/jn1cfr/you_dont_get_50_of_your_dna_from_each_parent_if/,genetics,-0.977641761302948

Why hasn't natural selection eliminated mental illness when much of it is genetic?,"Schizophrenia and depression for example have been linked to certain genes. People with it are more predisposed to those illnesses. My question is why hasn't natural selection eliminated these sorts of debilitating mental illnesses from the gene pool? Surely people with mental illness procreate less and have higher rates of suicide, and higher rates of isolation etc. which would result in the genes to failing to be passed on.

I suffer from depression myself, and I know how it can affect self-esteem, cause you to isolate etc. -- all of which should lessen the person's opportunities to procreate and pass on their genes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/jfl06v/why_hasnt_natural_selection_eliminated_mental/,genetics,-0.9990112781524658

What do y'all think about non-GMO labels on food that was never a GMO in the first place?,"So I was just enjoying some orange juice, and I noticed that it had that ""non-GMO project"" label. I am a plant geneticist, but that doesn't mean I know about every plant for which a GMO version exists. Note that in this case I'm talking specifically about oranges that are used for orange juice; I'm not interested in experimental oranges that never left the lab. 

Unsurprisingly, there are no GMO oranges used for orange juice. The public backlash would be severe if there were. Nobody would buy it as there is a lot of public distrust of GMO technology. I personally would eat GMOs all day long, but I am heavily biased. 

When you do a ""wide cross"" you alter many, many more genes than when you insert or delete a single gene from a plant. A wide cross is just a natural cross of two highly divergent lines. Most plant geneticists and breeders (including myself) are inherently trusting of a GMO because we understand that we have altered the genomes of plants way more than any GMO over the course of domestication and, more recently, modern breeding strategies. 

For example, go plant some corn as you know it in the wild and see what happens (hint: it'll die, it is COMPLETELY dependent on humans for its survival, and it doesn't resemble its wild relatives in the slightest.. it is literally a genetic abomination created by humans). 

Does it bother any of you that one orange juice company might have an edge over another company because they paid for the non-GMO project verification? Here's a fun fact for you all: I googled the project the other day, and the leadership team is almost entirely composed of CEOs from organic food producers... conflict of interest? You betcha. I personally attempt to buy products that do not have this label, but it is hard.. they are putting it on everything now. Soon your plastic cup will say ""non-GMO."" Rant over.

I created a very popular genetics mod for a game. I need help in improving it!,"Hello, hopefully this post doesnt violate rules 😬

You can skip this context if you like.

I'm the creator of the mod [Improved Genetics](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1706741706) for Crusader Kings 2. Most of you are probably not familiar with the game, but the gist of it is that you play through a medieval dynasty. Your characters have children, and when you die you play as the main inheritor (usually your eldest son.) As a result, most players in this game are very interested in what genes their offspring inherit.

In the base game, inheritance is very simple. You either inherit a trait your parents have, or you don't. My system adds Mendelian and Polygene inheritance systems like so: for each trait (say, height), you have three separate allele pairs that can contribute to the existence of the genotype. AA, BB, CC. Your offsprings pairs are calculated through a punnet square. There is then a genotype to phenotype conversion. 

The objective of the mod is not to create a perfect genetic system, but to enhance the game with a somewhat scientific genetic system. 

However, this is all rather difficult as I am an economist, not a geneticist. So I would really appreciate help (either on this topic or you can PM me.) 

\*\*My two main questions are these: \*\*

1. How exactly do genes becoming very strongly embedded in a certain bloodline/family? In my system (a Mendelian-ish system), if someone has clubfoot, that would mean they have the presence of at least two recessive pairs that deal with clubfoot (aabbCC, for example.) Does this make sense? My problem with this is that it doesn't really allow a gene to become very strongly ingrained in a family. In fact, it vanishes after one generation of out-breeding.
2. Kind of building on the first... How exactly does inbreeding arise? Within a Mendelian system, I get that repeated family marriage can lead to pairs that are either AA or aa.) This should lead to more recessive genes over time. But it doesnt explain how a brother and sister marrying instantly leads to genetic problems in the offspring.

"Can you design a virus that injects pieces of your own DNA to cure diseases that affect the DNA due to a later mutation, like cancer?","*I'm doing a bit of research for maybe writing a fiction story, I'm not very familiar with the field.*

I've seen people using AAV viruses to inject custom made DNA genes to an organism and even to humans.

Let's take cancer. I'm curious if, in the future, you could take healthy non-mutated cell DNA from someone, isolate the genes that prevent a normal cell to divide uncontrollably, create a virus with those genes to then inject back in that person so now, even if the virus targets non-mutated cells, nothing happens, but if it targets mutated cells they get back the kill-switch which they lost.

&#x200B;

Is this feasible in the future? If not what is the main problem and can a concept like this work in a way: using a healthy cell from someone compare it to a mutated cell, isolated the where the mutation happened, create a virus to target that mutation, and replace it with genes from the non-mutated part.",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/hk81qz/can_you_design_a_virus_that_injects_pieces_of/,genetics,-0.9978957176208496

Anonymity around ancestry testing ,"I (25yo) was adopted from China as a baby and have tried looking for my bio parents. It was illegal to give kids up for adoption back in the day, so there’s no official paperwork documenting my history. When I turned 18 I went back to China to the orphanage to try to look for any information regarding my birth parents, but found nothing. The only way I’d find my birth parents is if they looked for me (highly unlikely) or if I entered my DNA into a database and hope I match any relatives.
However, I am quite scared about having my genetic/health info out on any database because there are always data breaches. There are also so many cases where authorities use familial genetic testing, often illegally, to prosecute ppl. I don’t want to be able to be identified so I’m looking for advice on how to go about this. Should I test under a false name? And use a vpn or something? I know I sound paranoid but I am just cautious around data protection, especially relating to the Chinese government.

Please read before posting about Genetic Genie and BRCA1 mutations,"Hi everyone,

We've gotten a pretty big uptick in posts about rs80357868, which is a pathogenic variant in the *BRCA1* gene. Several users have posted rather concerning Genetic Genie results showing that they are homozygous (two copies) for the ""I"" allele (this will show up as ""II"" inside a scary red circle).

To be clear, **the ""I"" variant is the normal, healthy variant** (see [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs80357868) or [SNPedia](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs80357868)). Almost all individuals will be homozygous for the ""I"" allele. It is the extremely rare deletion (""D"") allele that causes a loss of function in the *BRCA1* gene and increases breast cancer risk. Genetic Genie **incorrectly** reports the ""I"" allele as pathogenic. I've emailed them about this issue, and to their credit, they responded the same day and stated that they'll be disabling reporting on indels in 23andMe data while they work on a fix.

Going forward, we're going to be removing posts concerning erroneous Genetic Genie interpretations of rs80357868.

I'm also going to take this opportunity to soapbox for a bit. Please note that generally speaking, consumer-oriented genetic tests (including those provided by 23andMe) should not be relied upon to diagnose disease. There are serious concerns about the specificity of these tests and the automated interpretation tools (case in point here) and their sensitivity (e.g., 23andMe's *BRCA* panel only covers 3 *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* variants common in Ashkenazi Jews). Diagnoses should be made by licensed healthcare professionals who can review the totality of clinical and genetic evidence for a given patient.

When comparing animal species, are we comparing all alleles of a gene and just stating we share those genes even if we have different alleles? Are we comparing the exact same genes and looking for point mutations? Or are we comparing the basepairs? Is the human genome we are comparing to a chimp genome like an average of a bunch of human and chimp genomes? Is the 2% difference in chimps and humans mainly single point mutations, or whole other genes that both species don't share?

I always found that when percentage of genetic difference and similarity is given to laypeople, it can really come out confusing.

Would most if these genes differ greatly in function or be deactivated, or be required for any complex organism to live?

This opens up a huge meltingpot of potential research. Out of the 100,000 mapped viral genes in our human genome, what functions, positive or negative, do these viral genetics perform?

2: Mimivirus: A member of a very ancient order of “megaviruses” that contain huge sets of DNA responsible for sophisticated translational machinery, as well as its’ very own immune system – some genomes are larger than the genomes of fully functional bacteria. Something previously thought to have been a ‘dead’ pathogen reveals itself to be something much more, perhaps even alive. Scientists are calling for a new branch of life to be created to cater for these organisms that are viral in nature, but also share some functions usually seen in living cells.

Most importantly, it has been discovered that Mimivirus’ contains a defense mechanism against virophages. This defense mechanism has been named “MIMIVIRE” and is being looked at as a potential gene editing tool: [https://www.statnews.com/2016/02/29/giant-virus-immune-system/](https://www.statnews.com/2016/02/29/giant-virus-immune-system/) , [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6538805/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6538805/)

Why don't there seem to be any chromosome abnormalities with positive effects?,"I've been reading up on various chromosome abnormalities and the various diseases associated with them and I am wondering why there seem to be no such abnormalities that result in (at least mostly) positive effects on the individual.

Now there are multiple possibilities that I considered, but I would love for someone more knowledgeable than me to elucidate me on this. Possibilities that I have though about:

* Non-Diagnosedness: For people who exhibit positively increased or extraordinary biological or psychological abilities, there may be not enough incentive for a chromosomal analysis like a karyotype. Combined with the general rarity of chromosome abnormalities, this could lead to such an abnormality never having been diagnosed (or at least not sufficiently to be considered a disorder.

* Genetic perfection: Although very improbable to me, there would be the possibility that the current human genome is ""perfect"" as is and any chromosomal changes can therefore only result in negative effects. This seems almost impossible to me, because there are mutations like CCR5-Δ32 with would be considered positive (HIV-1 resistance and alleged cognitive improvement), and while this is considered just an allele rather than a chromosome abnormality due to being an ""in-place-change"", I can hardly believe that a chromosome abnormality could not result in a positive change as well through e.g deletions or duplications.

* Terminological misunderstanding: In the previous paragraph I differentiated between the allele CCR5-Δ32 probably resulting from ""in-place-mutation"" and the term of chromosome abnormality due to my understanding that such singular mutations are not sufficient to be called chromosome abnormalities, but that there needs to be one of aneuploidy, total or partial deletion or duplication of a chromosome, translocation of part or whole of a chromosome into/onto another chromosome, inversion or ring formation.  
Should this be the case and e.g. the aforementioned allele would be considered a chromosome abnormality, and answer my question by example, though I find it unfortunate that there seems to be no term for such ""positive disorders"" (at least I couldn't find one)

If you have come to this point, I warmly thank you for taking the time for reading through all of this. I am looking forward to your answers, irrespective of whether or not you have read my hypotheses.

Edit: Because it is necessary for an answer, here is the extended definition of chromosome abnormality that I am basing this question on: Anoploidies of any kind, partial deletion, partial duplication, translocation of two parts of a chromosome, attachment of a chromosome onto the centromere of another chromosome, inversion of a chromosomal part after breaking at any point, ring formation of a chromosomal part after breaking off, according to the [NHGRI](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Chromosome-Abnormalities-Fact-Sheet).

"How can some modern humans have up to 4% Neanderthal DNA, but also be 98% similar to chimpanzees?","I'm probably overlooking some trivial mathematical fallacy, but I'm wondering what it means exactly to have 4% Neanderthal DNA.

If I, as a modern human, may have 4% of my genes from Neanderthal ancestry, does it mean that that 4% is _absolutely specific_ to Neanderthals, and that other ancient humans would never have those genes? If that is the case, then doesn't that make modern humans and Neanderthals _at most_ 96% similar? And if that is the case, then how could Neanderthals, another human subspecies, be _less_ similar to modern humans than chimpanzees are?

---

**Edit:** Thank you all for the helpful answers. To sum up my understanding: the difference lies in what particular attribute of the DNA is being observed, i.e., the 4% figure and the 98% figure each arise from comparing two different things – and on their own merit, they're both right.

A modern human may have an up to 4% match between their single-nucleotide polymorphisms and those identified by the Neanderthal genome project.

A modern human is a 98.8% match with a chimpanzee in terms of all coding regions. The same number between a modern human and a Neanderthal would be 99.7%.",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/ilfjy7/how_can_some_modern_humans_have_up_to_4/,genetics,0.9953385591506958

Genetic overlap between schizophrenia and cannabis use,"Observational studies have consistently found an association between schizophrenia and cannabis use. The nature of this association is unclear. Does cannabis cause schizophrenia, or does schizophrenia cause cannabis, or are they both caused by a confounder?

[This study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4382963/) tried to settle the issue using genetics. They found that polygenic risk score (PRS) for schizophrenia predicted cannabis use. In other words, people who had a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia were more likely to use cannabis. The authors concluded that cannabis *does not* cause schizophrenia, rather it is a case of genetic confounding/pleiotropy.

In my understanding, this is an unfounded conclusion. We don't actually know what the alleles in the PRS *do*, we only know that they are *associated* with schizophrenia. If cannabis does in fact cause schizophrenia, we should expect cannabis-induced schizophrenia to be included in the GWAS, and alleles that cause cannabis would show up in the PRS. If that's the case, this study is basically just saying ""predisposition to cannabis use predicts cannabis use"", which is a tautology.

I drew this picture to explain what I mean: https://imgur.com/4xsp0rR.

How Blue Eyed Parents Can Have Brown Eyed Children,"# Two Different Ways to Get Blue Eyes

Eye color is much more complicated than is usually taught in high school.  There we learn that two genes influence eye color.

One gene comes in two versions, brown (B) and blue (b).  The other gene comes in green (G) and blue (b).  All eye color and inheritance was thought to be explained by this [simple model](https://genetics.thetech.org/node/283).  Except of course for the fact that it is obviously incomplete.

The model cannot, for example, explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Yet this can and does happen (although it isn’t common).   

New research shows that the first gene is actually two separate genes, OCA2 and HERC2.  In other words, there are two ways to end up with blue eyes.  

Normally this wouldn’t be enough to explain how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  Because of how eye color works (see below), if one gene can cause brown eyes, it would dominate over another that causes blue.  In fact, that is what happens with green eyes in the older model.  The brown gene dominates over the green one resulting in brown eyes.

The reason these two genes can explain darker eyed kids with lighter eyed parents is that the two genes need each other to work.  And that the blue versions are broken genes.  Here is what things look like:

https://i.redd.it/jcbw5zczfrb41.gif

The key is that if someone makes a lot of pigment in the front part of their eye, they have brown eyes.  And if they make none there, they have blue.

Part of the pigment making process involves OCA2 and HERC2.  A working HERC2 is needed to turn on OCA2 and OCA2 helps to actually get the pigment made.  They need each other to make pigment.

So someone with only broken HERC2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what OCA2 says.  This is because the working OCA2 can't be turned on so no pigment gets made.

And the opposite is true as well.  Someone with broken OCA2 genes will have blue eyes no matter what the HERC2 genes are.  Turning on a broken pigment making gene still gives you no pigment.  You need a working HERC2 and a working OCA2 to have brown eyes.

Because the two genes depend on each other, it is possible for someone to actually be a carrier of a dominant trait like brown eyes.  And if two blue eyed parents are carriers, then they can have a brown eyed child.  Genetics is so much fun!

So all you light eyed parents with dark eyed kids, stop asking those paternity questions (unless you have other reasons to be suspicious).  Darker eyed kids are a real possibility that can now be explained with real genes.  

Carrying a Dominant Trait

Two of the most important genes in eye color are OCA2 and HERC2.  Both come in versions that can cause blue eyes.  And they need each other to work. (In genetics, a relationship like this is called epistasis.)  

These two facts provide one explanation for how blue eyed parents can have a brown eyed child.  To understand how, a little genetics refresher course is in order.

People have two copies of most of their genes.  They get one copy from mom and one copy from dad.

These genes can come in different versions (or alleles).  For the sake of this discussion, we will say that OCA2 comes in brown (O) and blue (o) versions.  Reality is actually a bit more complicated and this will be dealt with in the second article of this series.

HERC2 also comes in two different versions, brown (H) and blue (h).  Since people have two copies of each gene, there are nine different possible genetic combinations.  They are:

https://i.redd.it/kmnalgdpgrb41.gif

These different combinations give the following eye colors:

https://i.redd.it/phrcc5prgrb41.gif

Looking at the table, it quickly becomes obvious that any time there are two lower case h’s or two lower case o’s, a person has blue eyes.  As will be discussed in the next section, this is because HERC2 and OCA2 need each other to have an effect and the blue versions of each gene are broken.

But this part of the article will focus on how two blue eyed parents might have a brown eyed child.  Imagine the following blue eyed parents:

https://i.redd.it/cm4wvbwugrb41.gif

The easiest way to figure out what possible eye colors their kids might have is with a Punnett square.  The first thing to do in a Punnett square is to array dad’s possible sperm cells across the top of the table and mom’s eggs down the left hand side like this:

https://i.redd.it/v6qsjsxwgrb41.gif

Shown below is a simplified version of the table in which duplicate sperm and eggs have been eliminated:

https://i.redd.it/1583rtozgrb41.gif

The next step is to fill in the squares with the possible genetic combinations.  Filling in the first one immediately gives a brown eyed child:

https://i.redd.it/1aqqxd3bhrb41.gif

Here are the rest of the possibilities:

https://i.redd.it/f9kydct2hrb41.gif

Each child has a 25% chance of having brown eyes and a 75% chance of having blue eyes.  This is simplified since the other eye color genes (like those that influence green eyes) are being ignored.  But it does mean that brown (or green or hazel or…) eyes are a definite possibility for these blue eyed parents.

Also note that the child in the lower right hand corner no longer carries a brown eye gene.  They will not have a brown eyed child as easily as their parents!

And the chances could be even higher with oo HH and OO hh parents.  This is what their Punnett square would look like:

![gif](wbgv7muehrb41 ""
"")

All of their kids would have brown eyes!  (The table has been simplified to eliminate duplicate gene combinations.)  

(Also, things are actually a bit more complicated than what I have shown here because HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on the same chromosome.  Go to the end of the article if you’d like to learn what effect this has.)

Again this is understandably a bit confusing since these parents are technically carrying a dominant brown trait.  To understand this, we need to get into the nitty gritty of how eye color and these two genes work.

# Why OCA2 and HERC2 Need Each Other

Eye color depends on how much pigment is in the eye.  A lot of pigment gives brown, some gives green and little or no gives blue.  (Click [here ](https://genetics.thetech.org/node/312)to learn why no pigment gives blue.)

OCA2 is one of the key genes in determining how much pigment gets made.  So it makes sense that if both OCA2 copies are broken, someone would have blue eyes.  Because they can’t make a lot of pigment.

Most of the HERC2 gene has very little to do with eye color.  There is one small section in the middle, though, that controls whether OCA2 is turned on or not.

If this part of HERC2 ends up broken in both copies, then OCA2 can’t get turned on.  And if OCA2 is off, no pigment gets made.  It is like the OCA2 gene is broken.

https://i.redd.it/lqk2gmh6jrb41.gif

Think about OCA2 like a light bulb and HERC2 as a switch.  If the light bulb is burned out, it doesn’t matter if the switch is turned on.  Just like it doesn’t matter if HERC2 works in someone with broken OCA2.  Flipping the switch to a burned out bulb won’t give you any light!

Same thing with a working OCA2 and a broken HERC2.  A working light bulb gives no light when the switch is off.  And a working OCA2 makes no pigment when the HERC2 gene is broken.

This is what happens when blue eyed parents carry a brown eye gene.  If they have blue eyes because of a broken HERC2, then they might still have an OCA2 that works.  And if they have a broken OCA2, they might have a working HERC2.

Here is how to think of it in terms of these two parents passing on their genes to the next generation:

![gif](mfsqsovehrb41 ""
"")

When these two have kids, one might pass an on switch and the other a working light bulb.  Now there is light even though neither parent could make light before.  Or in genetic terms, one might pass a working HERC2 and the other a working OCA2.  Now there is pigment where there wasn't any before.  The end result is brown eyes.

This light bulb/switch relationship is called epistasis in genetics.  This is simply a fancy way of saying that one gene depends on the other.  And that if one breaks down, both will no longer have an effect.

So now science can finally explain one mystery of eye color.  Or at least propose one of the ways blue eyed parents can have brown eyed kids.

The next article will deal with eye colors other than the big three.  And talk a bit about why some hair colors tend to have certain eye colors.

***OCA2 and HERC2 are Linked***

An interesting twist to this puzzle is the fact that HERC2 and OCA2 are so close together on chromosome 15.  What this means is that versions tend to travel together.  And this affects the combinations of kids that any two parents can actually have.

Imagine these parents:

https://i.redd.it/u2di7vfairb41.gif

If we assume the OCA2 and HERC2 genes were far from each other, we’d get the following Punnett square:

https://i.redd.it/cwcyp4scirb41.gif

The results are a 9 in 16 chance for brown and a 7 in 16 chance for blue.  This assumes that any of four combinations of the two genes is possible.  This is true for genes that are far apart or on different chromosomes.  This does not tend to be true if genes are really close together like OCA2 and HERC2.

Imagine that these two parent’s chromosomes actually look like the ones on the right.  Because of how their alleles (gene versions) happen to be arranged, their real Punnett square would look like this:

https://i.redd.it/t4buzpqlirb41.gif

Now blue is less likely.  And all the blue eyed kids wouldn’t be carrying a brown eyed gene anymore!  And if the alleles were arranged differently, you’d get different odds.

Many people become confused at this point because they think that this situation should happen in every case where two genes are on the same chromosome.  It doesn’t because of something called [recombination](https://genetics.thetech.org/node/529).  That is a story for another day…

Insufficient Evidence for “Autism-Specific” Genes,"A while ago there was a post asking about the relationship of genetic factors to autism, so I thought this review from leaders in the genetic disorder/neuroscience community would be of interest to this community.

TL;DR

Autism has been shown to be highly heritable through genetic and twin studies, however autism is highly correlated with general neurodevelopmental disruption. Some people are trying to differentiate genes specific to autism vs gene common to developmental disorders. Particularly they want to identify genes that when mutated lead to autism with a high degree of certainty. Identify particular genetic mutations that cause autism (note, they cause particular cases of autism with high certainty, but are not the cause of all cases) would allow for easier development of therapies in these case.

Important research idea: analyzing the DNA of historical gray wolves from Colorado & comparing them to extant gray wolves to provide information on best population(s) for reintroduction.,"With the acceptance of Initiative 107 in the 2020 election ballot and the introduction of Senate Bill 20-121, it is likely only a matter of time before the gray wolf (*Canis lupus*) is reintroduced to Colorado. Reintroduction will occur by the end of either 2023 or 2025, depending on what passes and/or has legal priority.

By that time, a population (or two) must be chosen as stock for reintroduction. A Colorado reintroduction will reconnect the entire North American gray wolf metapopulation, so the reintroduced population(s) should be genetically similar to the original population in order to best restore the genetic connectivity that existed before the latter's extirpation. As such, the reintroduced population(s) should belong to the same subspecies as the original population if possible. In addition, neighboring populations would theoretically be the best stock for reintroduction due to greater historical gene flow between them and the original population.

Under the original classification of gray wolf subspecies, two are native to Colorado: the plains gray wolf (*Canis lupus nubilus*) and the southern rocky mountain gray wolf (*Canis lupus youngi*); both are extinct, so a different subspecies would have to be used for reintroduction if this taxonomy is accepted (Young & Goldman 1944; Mech 1970). However, the 1995 reclassification of gray wolf subspecies lumped the southern rocky mountain gray wolf into the plains gray wolf (thus making it the only subspecies native to Colorado) and ""resurrected"" the subspecies, as extant gray wolves from parts of Canada, the Great Lakes region, and the Pacific Coast are included within it. Thus, the native subspecies could be restored if one (or more) of those populations are selected as the reintroduction stock. But the geographically closest extant populations belong to different subspecies, the northwestern gray wolf (*Canis lupus occidentalis*) to the north and the Mexican gray wolf (*Canis lupus baileyi*) to the south. So it can be argued that these subspecies would be better stock for reintroduction since they likely had greater gene flow with the original population (Nowak 1995; Phillips et al. 2000).

This is all assuming that the current subspecies taxonomy is correct. When choosing stock for reintroduction, it is important to keep in mind that the classification (both original and revised) of gray wolf subspecies is based off of phenotype, and as such it may not accurately reflect the genetic relations between gray wolf populations. So far, researchers have found that the recognized subspecies do not completely align with the genetic clusters. This is particularly true for the plains gray wolf, which could have huge implications for the selection of reintroduction stock (Knowles 2010; NCEAS 2014; Schweizer et al. 2015). With that in mind, I suggest that when selecting stock for reintroduction, we should focus on the genetic relations between the candidate populations and the original population, regardless of what subspecies they are currently classified as under the phenotype-based taxonomy (I also want to see a genetics-based reclassification of gray wolf subspecies, but that is a topic for another day). We can use the existing genetic studies to speculate on the best source population(s) for a Colorado reintroduction.

A 2016 study that focused on northern gray wolves from the Canadian Rocky Mountains found that the population was divided into two genetic groups: a northern group and a southern group (Cullingham et al. 2016). Three years later, a study that focused on northern gray wolves in the American Northwest was able to genetically distinguish between the recolonized Montana population and the reintroduced Yellowstone/Idaho population. It should be noted that the Montana population is descended from wolves that migrated through the Southern Canadian Rockies, while the Yellowstone/Idaho population was translocated from the Northern Canadian Rockies (Boyd 1995; Hendricks et al. 2019). Thus, the modern Montana population was geographically closer to the original Colorado population than the modern Yellowstone/Idaho population was during historical times and might be more related to it due to greater gene flow.

There is a captive population of the northern gray wolf that is possibly even more closely related to the original Colorado population: the gray wolves at the McCleery Buffalo Wolf Foundation. These wolves are allegedly descended from the original American Rocky Mountain population, and if that is true then they are the last remnants of that population (“Dr. McCleery” n.d.). A 2005 study found that the original American West population had mitochondrial haplotypes that do not occur in extant gray wolf populations (Leonard et al. 2005), so the restoration of the McCleery Buffalo Wolf Foundation gray wolf will prevent the loss of genetic diversity that otherwise would have been lost. However, these wolves are highly inbred and it might be too late to save them (French 2019); if that is the case, then their genes could be added into the northern gray wolf population that is reintroduced to Colorado.

The aforementioned 2005 study also identified a southern gray wolf clade with distinct mitochondrial haplotypes that extended from Mexico to Utah to Nebraska; this clade has been supported by other genetic studies. The Mexican gray wolf is the only surviving member of the southern gray wolf clade, and while it is currently isolated it historically had gene flow with the northern gray wolf. Due to these findings, some wolf geneticists recommend reintroducing the Mexican gray wolf to the Southern Rocky Mountains (Leonard et al. 2005; NCEAS 2014; Hendricks et al. 2016).

So based on known information, the best stock population for reintroduction into northern Colorado would either be the northwestern Montana gray wolf, the McCleery Buffalo Wolf Foundation gray wolf, or an admixed population of both.\* Meanwhile, the Mexican gray wolf would be the best stock population for reintroduction into southern Colorado, and ultimately gene flow would be reestablished between the two reintroduced populations.

However, there has yet to be a study that focuses on the genetics of the original Colorado population and the reintroduction candidate populations. In order to maximize the conservation benefit of a Colorado reintroduction, there should be studies that analyze the DNA of original Colorado population and compare them to extant gray wolves. That data should then be used to select stock population(s) for the reintroduction.

I would love to do this research myself, but unless a miracle happens then I will not get into graduate school and complete a DNA study by the reintroduction deadlines. In any case, it is always better to have multiple scientists studying the topic. I understand that it is not realistic to have hundreds of studies on the genetics of gray wolves before reintroduction, but we should at least have a few that focus on Colorado to inform our decisions. I really hope that an experienced geneticist will pursue my proposed research idea.

\*Note: This is not to say that the modern Yellowstone/Idaho gray wolves are invasive or that they should be prohibited from naturally colonizing Colorado; genetic research was limited at the time of their reintroduction, and from an ecological perspective it probably does not matter which subspecies is restored as long it can fulfill the niche of the species. But if we are going to intentionally reintroduce gray wolves to Colorado, then we should now consider conservation genetics when selecting stock for reintroduction, especially if the reintroduced population will reconnect isolated populations.

"Learning PCR, Gel Electrophoresis; creating exercises for myself, need some verification I'm on track","First some background:  I'm not a student - I'm a 56 y/o electronics engineer and programmer who is branching out to include a deep study of genetics, self-taught.  I've done a lot of research and have put together a fairly capable lab.  I'm familiar with PCR techniques, programming runs; Gel Electrophoresis runs, etc.  But now I want to branch out and start using non-premade ""labs"" of the kind that include primers that were pre-mixed specifically for the lab exercise - Now, I'm wanting to create my own labs, and either order my own primers, or ideally, make them.

For example, while I know that OCA2 is not the only gene that controls eye color, it makes for an interesting lab if I can do a cheek swab, extract, and create a PCR run with primers specific to OCA2 (such as the ones I find at https://pga.mgh.harvard.edu/primerbank/ ), then run a gel to view the amplified copy of my OCA2 and see that the length of the fragment corresponds to the expected length of OCA2 to verify if I've done the work correctly.

First - is my thinking of this correct?  I know some genes like Per3 which is the ""Circadian Clock"" gene, have a variable number tandem repeat of 54 base pairs, and so a gel run on this can show visually by the separation, and that in turn lets you know which particular version of Per3 you have.  But as far as I know OCA2 doesn't contain any VNTRs, so any given run should show the same against a DNA ladder - yes?  Same goes for any other gene I may wish to select without VNTRs... if my understanding is correct.

Second, when I find primers in the PrimerBank, searching by gene symbol, there are often three or more sets of primers that are returned.  A gap in my knowledge currently is knowing why the multiple differing primers and how to determine which is best for my ""lab"" exercise - hoping someone can help there.

Lastly, am I correct in assuming that for the majority of genes isolated and visualized in this way, the only way to know what that gene is coded for in a given sample is through sequencing with something like the Oxford Nanopore MinION - a bit out of my budget right now...  Is this correct?  Are there any other interesting genes whose expression can be inferred from the fragment length?

Apologies for the areas where my questions indicate an utter lack of formal knowledge...  but this is one of the most fascinating fields I've ever studied, and I'm a VERY fast learner, I promise I'll make it up to you all :)

Mosaic Trisomy 16,"Hi! I was born with mosaic trisomy 16, and I barely know anything about it. you think given that reddit is so huge, I’d find other people who also have it, but apparently that’s not the case! 

I just wanna start by saying that I’m awful at science, so hopefully I don’t sound too dumb. I don’t even know if this is the right place to post this. but anyways, 

When I was born, I was only one of 33 known cases of MT16 at the time- in the entire country.  My mom said my birth was a circus show, but she got a lot of special treatment during her pregnancy with me.

I’ve spent my entire life digging for absolutely anything that I could find about MT16 since the moment my mom first explained it to me, and every year I check up on google to see if anything new has been published LOL. All I can seem to collectively grasp is:

1) I’m really small because of MT16 (i’m confirmed to have IGR, i’m 4’11! very teeny.)
2) I have a funny deformed ear and the toes on my right foot don’t fully curl, which I guess is also from MT16? it’s not hereditary at all.
3) My mental health is absolutely not the best. But extensive studies of MT16 and mental health seem to be nonexistent so there’s possibly no relation at all. 

my main question though, is whether or not I could potentially pass MT16 onto my future children- that is if I ever have any. Would this mean they could potentially have said symptoms? or more symptoms than what I have? Such as heart, genital and spine deformities? or could it even result in full trisomy 16..? and cause issues with keeping a pregnancy? 

I feel like the obvious answer is yes, but it’s not like MT16 is something that runs through my family.

idk. it’s a rare thing to have is what ALL articles read, but I feel like I’m just too normal of a person to even have something like MT16 be a part of me. I just have a ton of questions, and sadly can’t figure out the answers on my own. 

Thank you in advance if anyone has some good stuff to read or an answer to give! <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/cppp80/mosaic_trisomy_16/,genetics,-0.9990565180778503

Need help someone to correct my text for this assignment on hormones and contraceptives,"Hello, I was curious if anyone could give this high school assignment a read and tell me how I could improve my text. I don't need grammar recommendations, but more along these criteria set by my teacher:

• You explain the details, and use correct and relevant terminology throughout the text.

• You analyze and seek answers to complex questions regarding microorganisms and their significance for health and disease.

• You discuss in detail, with nuance, complex issues that concern this. In your discussion, you present well-founded and nuanced arguments and explain in detail, and nuanced, the consequences of several positions. You highlight relevant new issues that propels your discussion forward.

>**How do hormones work and why are they important? Integrate relevant examples into your explanation.**

Hormones are chemical messengers that travel through the body and coordinate complex processes such as growth, metabolism, and fertility. Hormones can affect the function of the immune system and even change the behavior of humans. Before birth, hormones lead to the development of the brain and reproductive system. Hormones are the reason why two arms have the same length, the reason why you can turn food into fuel in the form of energy and ATP, and transition from child to adult through puberty.

It happens as if a signal is sent to the brain to secrete hormones into the blood through the glands that produce and store these hormones. In turn, these glands form the so-called endocrine system. Chemicals that interfere with the function of hormones are therefore called endocrine disruptors. Then we also have the testicles and ovaries, or ""gonads"", which are perhaps the most famous endocrine glands. In men, the testicles produce sperm and secrete the male sex hormone testosterone; in women, the ovaries produce eggs and the female hormone estrogen. It is these hormones that determine secondary sex characteristics such as muscle mass and facial hair. They also help orchestrate sperm production, menstruation, and pregnancy. Other endocrine glands include the thyroid gland, the islands of the pancreas, and the adrenal glands. These are mainly involved in growth, metabolism, and ""fight or flight"" responses to stress.

While all cells are exposed to hormones circulating in the bloodstream, not all cells respond. Only the ""target"" cells of a hormone, which have receptors for that hormone, will respond to its signal. When the hormone binds to its receptor, it causes a biological response in the cell. Metaphorically, if a hormone is a radio signal, then the receptor is the antenna. Without the antenna, no signal is received and no music would leave the radio. The signaling stops when the circulating hormones are broken down and secreted by the body.

Then there are also endocrine disruptors that can affect the hormone signal pathway. Some are hormone-like: they bind the receptor and send a false signal, which has not come from the brain. Other endocrine disruptors block the effect that a natural hormone should have and prevent it from binding to the receptor and creating an effect. Endocrine disorders can also change the amount of hormone that is synthesized, how quickly it is broken down or how a target cell should react. All these mechanisms of action can create the same effect, like interfering with the development of an embryo or causing an altered function in an adult.

Then the regulation of blood sugar (glucose) with the peptide hormone insulin can be a good example of a negative feedback mechanism, as blood sugar rises, receptors in the body feel a change. The beta cells in the pancreas contain insulin, and they enter the bloodstream to regulate blood sugar levels as the vesicles inside the beta cells fuse with the cell membranes through exocytosis. When blood sugar levels reach homeostasis (stable and constant state, or equilibrium), the pancreas stops secreting insulin. The liver then takes up glucose and stores it as glycogen, while the body cells take up glucose. Blood glucose levels fall as a result. We can also reach homeostasis when glucose levels are already low in the blood, the alpha cells in the pancreas release glucagon, which has the opposite effect to insulin, where it is then passed on to the liver and stimulates the conversion of stored glycogen to glucose, by the liver breaking down glycogen and releasing glucose, which leads to an increase in glucose in the blood. Homeostasis occurs.

>**Analyze and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of eating contraceptives, so-called. birth control pills.**

Birth control pills are a type of medicine with hormones that come in a package, and you take one pill out of it every day. The birth control pills themselves are safe, cheap, and effective, provided you take the pill in time. In addition to preventing pregnancy, the pills have many other health benefits as well. How they work is that they prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg. The hormones in birth control pills also stop ovulation, and this means that there is no egg for sperm to fertilize. This can have positive effects on a woman who is not mature enough to take care of one child, or a family for that matter, if we take into account factors outside of biology. What the contraceptive pill is also good for is that the hormones make the mucous membrane thicker in the cervix. A thicker cervical mucosa means a blockage of sperm so that it can not swim to an egg. Unfortunately, this is not enough to defend the cervix from infections that can come with intercourse with a man, which is why you should both wash after sex, and also the man should wear a condom. Even more effective in preventing pregnancy is if the man also carries a condom while the woman consumes her birth control pills. A contraceptive pill also has other benefits that reduce acne, regulate the menstrual cycle more easily and regularly, and reduce menstrual cramps. This is due to the hormones in birth control pills. Some disadvantages of this contraceptive pill are that the hormones in the contraceptive pill can change the level of desire for sex. You can also detect spots or bleeding between periods, get sore breasts, get nauseous or have headaches. These side effects usually go away after a few weeks, and not everyone happens to take birth control pills.",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/nikipy/need_help_someone_to_correct_my_text_for_this/,genetics,0.9559056162834167

Embarrassing Question,"So I was wondering why babies born to one white parent and one black parent have a skin tone that is a mix. Like, mum is black, dad is white, baby is lighter brown.
Surely, when it comes to genetics, they can only inherit one skin tone? If I think back to my punnet squares, black skin (BB) must be dominant, white skin (we) recessive, so would lightweight brown be Bw? But even then, Bw would just be black skin because it's dominant?

I hope my question makes sense. Like if we applied the logic to eye colour, if one parent had blue eyes and the other brown, their baby wouldn't have a blueish/brown mix? So why is it the case for skin tone?

We don’t have our full amnio results still, but one of baby’s gene did show the ga-1, but not on both sides? The doctor said he assumes he will see more dna with the condition when we get the results back, does that sound normal? Everything I look up says it’s not possible, but I don’t know.

My daughter was born with bright blue eyes that i thought would go away with time like most babies since we are both brown eyed and the vast majority of our family is too. But different healthcare providers have told us that ""she looks like she 's gonna keep her blue eyes"", because apparently her eye colour is very bright.

Obituary: Casey Brown,"Some of you may have known Casey personally from ASHG conferences, CSHL genomics courses (he held a virtual lobster dinner for the off-site one), or parasocially from his Twitter posts. 

For those who didn't know him, many of the academics on this sub are likely familiar with Casey's foundational work on allele specific expression, eQTLs, and his leadership role in GTEx, but may not have yet heard the awful news of his untimely death. 

Casey was the archetypical gregarious Midwesterner who easily formed deep and lasting personal connections. An incredibly incisive mind who could spot flaws in a paper, hypothesis, or experiment, but who never projected those flaws on the humans involved - something all of us should strive to match. He was a tireless advocate for trainees, for scientific rigor, and for fun. A dad, brother, son, and a great friend. 

His death is an incalculable loss to the field of genetics. We should have had 4+ decades more of his wisdom, humor, and insights.

Looking for a book that can help me refresh my basics.,"Hey guys,

I recently finished my undergrad in biochemistry, so I am more familiar with the molecular side of things than the genomics but ,funnily enough,  I am currently working on an evolutionary genetics project involving plant phylogeny. I am enjoying the work and my involvement has been strangely productive but I feel like taking some time to reconnect with the basics would be a very good idea. 

I could go down the rabbit hole and read article after article on genetics on Wikipedia or watch all the videos on khan academy that address the topic but perhaps a good book would be a better idea.

I am looking for a book on genetics that perhaps takes a comprehensive approach to the basics.  I am familiar and  mostly comfortable with the foundational stuff starting from from meiosis to recombination to central dogma to mutations , Mendelian/non-Mendelian patterns of inheritance, Hardy-Weinberg etc. Still something to help me connect all the dots and get an idea of the larger picture would be nice.

I am afraid I might have to get a textbook and read it line by line but before I do that I was wondering if there was something that you guys read from time to time whenever you feel like you have forgotten something? Something other than a textbook?

I have heard both good things and bad things about ""The gene"" by Siddhartha Mukherjee. Wondering if there are some other stand out suggestions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/oi8sqs/looking_for_a_book_that_can_help_me_refresh_my/,genetics,-0.9834957718849182

Strategies to prevent transmission of COVID-19 (Coronavirus),"Here is an interesting article on ""scientific strategies to prevent the transmission of COVID-19."" We have enlisted various way to prevent it. some are: 

1. **Blocking cell receptor:** In this method, we can block the COVID-19 receptor on our cell surface. 
2. **Drug antagonist:** A drug analogue or antagonist can be used to block the CoV receptor on host cell. 
3. **Genetic Engineering:** Using genetic engineering tool, a viral gene for replicase can be removed to inactivate the replication machinery of the virus.  
4. **COVID-Vaccines:** Dead viral particles are used to make a vaccine.
5. **Artificial liposome:** An artificial cell-like envelop with a COVID-19 receptor can be used to trap the virus into it.

Could my identical twins possibly be semi-identical or is what I’m noticing epigenetics related?,"I have identical twin boys and I am wondering if it’s possible that they’re semi-identical. I know how rare they are, but there are a number of things that are making me scratch my head and I would appreciate someone who knows about this sort of thing hearing me out.

History: 
They were born at 35 weeks and neither of them needed assistance with breathing or anything serious. One twin weighed about 2lbs less than the other and they were MCDA twins. I got to look at the placenta and their sacs, and their umbilical cords which were quite different in size. It was presumed that they had twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Pathology tested the placenta and confirmed that there was only the one placenta. No genetic testing was done as far as I know.

Growing up, one twin was always smaller than the other, but I always presumed it was because of the TTTS. Small twin ended up developing epilepsy in early childhood, but otherwise they’ve both been pretty healthy. They look very much alike, but there’s some differences in facial features. Smaller twin has more delicate features and has remained smaller in a lot of ways. Their voices also have always sounded different. All things I have thought would be related to the TTTS.

They are both young men now and there’s even more differences popping up. Small twin has noticeably curlier and thicker hair than Big twin. Small twin is shorter than Big twin. Big twin has darker chest hair and more of it, and more leg hair than Small twin. They both have kind of cleft chins but it’s definitely not as prominent on Small twin. I don’t know if these would be epigenetics things? They both have yellow/green with grey/blue outer iris eyes if that helps any. 

They haven’t been assumed to be identical twins for some time and to be honest we didn’t get too much of that past young childhood anyway. They’re completely different people. I do know that happens with even the most ID of ID twins, but I don’t know that TTTS could change someone physically so much? The curly hair really puzzles me.

Any info would be great, thanks.

Researchers identify a genetic mutation linked to needing less sleep,"[**Can Genetics Explain Why Some People Thrive on Less Sleep?** – Several members of the same family get by on less than six hours of sleep a night. Their genetics could illuminate how sleep works for the rest of us., *The New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/30/science/sleep-gene.html)

_______

[Researchers identify a gene\[tic mutation\] linked to needing less sleep, *EurekAlert*](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2019-08/cp-ria082119.php)

>The family whose DNA led to the identification of this gene is one of several that Ptáček and UCSF geneticist Ying-Hui Fu, the paper's other senior author, are studying and includes several members who function normally on only six hours of sleep. The gene, ADRB1, was identified using genetic linkage studies and whole-exome sequencing, which revealed a novel and very rare variant.

The latter article has a bigger focus on the scientific and technical details, the former includes some info not contained in the latter.

_______

[*New Scientist* reported it with ""DNA mutation lets some people live healthily on only 4 hours’ sleep""](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2214505-dna-mutation-lets-some-people-live-healthily-on-only-4-hours-sleep/amp/) but [I can't find anything in that study](https://twitter.com/prototyperspect/status/1178776871267373056) that says people only needed 4 hours of sleep:    
^(it says ""the human mutation carriers, on average, sleep 2 h/day less than non-mutation carriers"" after ""carrier \[...\] with a total sleep time of 7.5 h. This is still 1 h shorter than the population mean"". Hence the average for the mutation-carriers should be roughly 6.5 hours if I'm reading that right. The study also speaks of 4 h but only for ""natural short sleep\[ers\]"" in general:)

>^(Natural short sleep (NSS refers to individuals who have a lifelong tendency to sleep only 4–6 h per night and feel well rested. Kindred 50025 is a family segregating an autosomal dominant allele for familial natural short sleep (FNSS))

_______

The study is ""[A Rare Mutation of β1-Adrenergic Receptor Affects Sleep/Wake Behaviors](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)30652-X)"", published 1 month ago

[Here is a short review of this research-area](https://www.labroots.com/trending/genetics-and-genomics/15548/genetic-reasons-people-sleep).

_______

The DEC2-mutation discovery was in 2009. And in the NYT article it says:

>\[Dr. Fu\] said she has since found a few more \[genetic mutations\] that she has yet to describe in peer-reviewed journals.

[@SirT6](https://www.reddit.com/user/SirT6/) [writes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/czjnpb/researchers_discover_a_dna_mutation_that_lets/) that there is an S. pyogenes Cas9 PAM sequence exactly 4bp downstream of the wild-type allele and:

>Credit to @JSheltzer for pointing out that there is a Cas9 site so close to the allele, suggesting that it is amenable to modification by CRISPR. Still lots of work to do, though, know what cells to modify and what fraction would need to be modified to see an effect.

In [a report on the 2009 discovery](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/genetic-mutation-sleep-less/) Tafti and Fu elaborate on use-cases:

>In the future discoveries like this one may play a role in developing treatments for those who have sleep disorders, or just help regular people get by with less sleep. ""Decades from now, we can act on that pathway and make sleep more efficient,"" Tafti notes.  
>  
>Fu says helping people sleep a little less while maintaining their health and well-being is her ultimate dream.

What do you think of this? Will there soon be drugs available that act on these pathways? Maybe even a method to use CRISPR to modify this gene? Or do you think it'll be mostly just useful for better understanding sleep or there being yet unknown negative side-effects at least for some people (no negative ones have been found so far)?

A New species of human found in the Philippines- latest news release,"  

An international group of [researchers](https://jacobspublishers.com/jacobs-journal-of-genetics-issn-2381-8735/) has uncovered the remains of other types of human in the Philippines, demonstrating the area assumed a key job in hominin developmental history. Professor Philip Piper from is one of the Australian National University (ANU) he, says that the findings represent a noteworthy breakthrough in our understanding of human advancement crosswise over Southeast Asia. The researchers uncovered the remains of something like two adults and one juvenile inside the equivalent archeological deposits. ""The fossil remains included adult finger and toe bones, just as teeth. We likewise recovered a tyke's femur. There are some truly fascinating highlights - for instance, the teeth are tiny,"" Professor Piper said. 

""The span of the teeth for the most part, however not generally, mirror the general body-size of a well-evolved creature, so we think Homo luzonensis was likely moderately little. Precisely how little we don't have the foggiest idea yet. We would need to locate some skeletal components from which we could quantify body-measure all the more exactly"" Professor Piper said. ""It's quite incredible, the extremities, that is the hand and feet bones are astoundingly Australopithecine-like. The Australopithecines last strolled the earth in Africa around 2 million years ago and are considered to be the progenitors of the Homo gathering, which incorporates present-day people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/bcaf13/a_new_species_of_human_found_in_the_philippines/,genetics,0.9983084201812744

My dad is questioning the paternity of my sister,"Both my parents are type O. I reckon that means all three of my siblings should be type O. My dad overheard a conversation where one of my sisters said she thought her blood type was A or AB. My dad freaked out and asked me to ask her about her blood type privately so as to confirm paternity. My parents have been divorced since the last child (not the sister in question) was one. 

I don’t know the chances of an A or AB child coming from two O’s but my sister did say she wasn’t sure about her blood type and guessed and also that she thought she saw a blood type A on her birth certificate. As far as I’m aware, blood type is not printed on birth certificates. 

Is my dad’s worry credible, or are AB’s and A plausible from O blood types? I’ve thought of doing a store blood test with my sister to confirm.

Edit: I think we narrowed down that she couldn’t be our mom’s kid if she were an AB as well, so I think she could only be A (if there’s an A at all.) 

I should also note that realistically, my mom didn’t have time to cheat. She was a SAHM with a 5 year old me, and my 3 year old brother. Our mom was by our side nearly every day all the time and she never brought us around any men that could’ve been my sister’s “dad”.

Proteinase K is a member of the family subtilisin, typically a proteinase. The molecular mass of the proteinase K is \~28, 930kDa. The enzyme is typically a protein which is made up of the long chain of approximately 278 amino acids. The proteinase K digests mainly the hydrophobic amino acids ( both aromatic as well as aliphatic). The cofactor, calcium ion provides stability to the enzyme, However, it cannot increase the activity of the reaction.

"If we share 99.9% of our DNA with other humans, what’s with this idea of West Africans having 2-19% ghost hominid DNA?","So as you can imagine, I have no clue about genetics at all. But I see this idea being repeated all over Twitter lately, namely by racists, to say black Africans/black people are uniquely less human than everybody else. Can someone just help me understand the study that’s been the source for this? I was under the impression that 99.9% of our DNA is similar. While the other 0.1% is unique and where information about disease predispositions and our ancestry and things can be found. I even read that ancestry companies only test this 0.1% of our DNA.

Discussion of advanced coursework (upper division undergraduate or postgraduate level) may be allowed in the main sub at moderator discretion, but introductory college or high school level biology or genetics coursework is unlikely to generate substantial engagement/discussion, and thus must be posted in the homework help thread.

# Want to discuss your personal genetics or ancestry testing results?

Please direct such posts to other subs such as /r/23andMe, /r/AncestryDNA, /r/MyHeritage, etc. **Posts simply sharing such results are considered low effort and may be removed.** While we're happy to answer specific questions about how consumer genetics or ancestry testing works, many of these questions are addressed by our [FAQ](https://reddit.com/r/genetics/wiki/index); please review it before posting a question.

# Want medical advice?

**Please see a healthcare professional in real life.** If you have general health concerns, your primary care or family medicine physician/physician assistant is likely your best place to start. If you have specific concerns about whether you have a genetic condition (family history, preliminary test results, etc.), you may be better off consulting a specialist or seeking help from a genetic counselor. Most users here are not healthcare professionals, and even the ones that are do not have access to your full medical history and test results.

**Do not make clinical decisions or significant lifestyle changes based on the advice of strangers on the internet.** If you really want to ask medical questions on reddit, **please direct such questions to a sub like /r/AskDocs.** While we are happy to discuss the genetics and molecular biology of disease, or how a particular diagnostic technology works, providing medical advice is outside the scope of this subreddit, and such posts may be removed.

Career fields for people interested in genetics and computer science?,"I've found myself interested in both biology and computer science and have been looking for a career or area of research to kind of combine these two.

I've heard of bioinformatics but it doesn't seem appealing to me on the surface. I may not know enough about it, and if so please do inform me, but it seems like they are more focused on creating programs to make it easier to interpret the data but aren't actually having a hand in the actual experiments or research. 

I'm currently a computer science freshman but I may switch my major to biology and minor in computer science since genetics really does grab my interest. I like computer science a lot too but I'd rather use the skill set to contribute to science.

Let's genetically modify macroalgae to carry more lipids - and save the world. But is it possible?,"I want to reach out to all people who knows what's possible when it comes to GMO technology today.

***Would anyone with insight in GMO guess that it would be possible to genetically modify macroalgae for increased lipid production?***

*Why this would matter:*

The entrepreneurial wave during the 2010s for biofuel production using microalgae cultivation has now seized due to the realization that it's not economically feasible to farm microalgae for energy-yielding purposes. Most of the projects went bancrupt because the production was not cost effective. This is because to the fact that microalgae needs fertilizers, artificial ponds and green houses, land area and advanced extraction techniques for separation of the microalgae from the water, that makes it too expensive of a business.

**Macroalgae** **is on the other hand much cheaper to cultivate.** The potential of biomass production of macro-algae is today unparalleled, there is no other lifeform using photosynthesis that can compete with how fast it grows. You just use the vast areas of the ocean, no fertilization or ponds needed. The only thing they need is something to grow on, which we humans can easily assist them with engineering new types of floating ocean structures.

The issue with macro-algae is that it's lipid content, e.g. oil content, is too low for being usable as production of biodiesel. It tops on 5 % but is usually below this level at around 2 % for most cultivatable species.  Yes macro-algae could be fermented to get gas or ethanol, but that's costly too and we need better methods.

So then I thought - IF it would be possible to **genetically modify macroalgae to have a much higher lipid content, competing with microalgae, then macroalgae cultivation would be our greatest hope in producing sustainable biofuels** that are cost effective and with an industry that potentially will be also beneficial for marine life, fish stocks et.c (macroalgae forests are a great habitat for fish and decreases ocean acidification too). If it's lipid content would be on par with micro-algae, which is around 30 % in lipid content, then perhaps macroalgae will be a super good solution for cheap and sustainable biodiesel production.

I apologize for very inadequate referencing of sources for the facts that I rely my reasoning on. I just hope throwing out the question to people with better knowledge than I in GMO possibilities will lead to some insights and further incentive researching this in more depth.

Very grateful for any of your attention and thought on this question,

I would like some feedback on a video I’m making about ‘Junk’ DNA,"(Not sure what to flair this)

Hello, I don’t know if this is the right place to post, but I’ve been looking for feedback regarding a video I’m making. Its for a video competition for ages 13-18 in which I have to explain a scientific concept, theory, or method in 3 minutes or less. It will be judged based on difficulty, creativity, and accuracy. 

I’ve really been getting into genetics and ‘junk’ DNA really fascinated me. I want to make a video explaining how this ‘junk’ is actually useful. I believe I’ve got the information down but the opinion of an expert would really be appreciated:). Sadly my biology teacher isn’t of any help and I’ve run out of people to talk to. 

I wrote a rough draft of the first part of my video, and I’m afraid that I would continue writing it with possibly misinterpreted information (I’m the misinterpreter).

I would really appreciate it if somebody knowledgeable in this field could make sure my information is accurate, and if this isn’t the right place to ask please let me know!

GENETIC TESTING UNDERWAY!! Hooray!,"Thank you times a million. I posted a few weeks ago in regards to my 4 year old that is failure to thrive. FTT.   
Some suggested I ask for a Shwachman-diamond syndrome test, as well as a trio-exome. Yesterday, we met a new board certified pediatrician and geneticist. She was AMAZING. Her bedside manner was more than I could have asked for. A nurse spotted my 4 year old in the waiting area and found her to be adorable. She invited her to come with the nurse to get snacks and asked if she could have a sprite. I agreed. Then, the nurse took us back to the room about 15 minutes after that.  She told my daughter she could come with her to get the Dr. The dr. Ended up meeting my daughter before me. When they all came back into the room they were shocked by her intelligence. Literally their words not mine. The dr said my 4 year old was identifying vehicles and speaking so well.  So she sat down went over medical history birth to current. 
The first test she informs me she wants to try is Russel-silvers syndrome. Tells me H19. That it is NOT hereditary.  I asked her what she thought of doing the Diamond Schwachman test. She agreed. If both RS AND DS come back negative, she mentioned “an array”? If I’m saying it correctly. To try for that test.    She then asked my daughter if she can count. She counted to 20. Missing number 15.  The doctor told me intelligence wasn’t even a question, that she had advanced verbal skills and would probably be an over-achiever. I told her thank you for listening to me and for helping us. This could be as simple as HGH!

GMO vs Organic: Do Geneticists agree?,"I am working on a B.S. in Biology and plan to go to grad school and eventually get a PhD in Molecular Genetics. I really want to be a genetic engineer and read a lot about it in my free time. However, I used to work on an organic farm before studying Genetics. With my time studying genetics I think that GMOs are a great way to improve farm yields in less developed countries and increase nutrition as well. While everything has its ups and downs, I have been slammed recently for using my knowledge of science (and my University's access to free academic journals) to support GMOs as opposed to the large corporate organic farms. The literature that I find published in academic journals often overwhelmingly shows that GMOs are safe and that makes sense, seeing as we have been eating them for thousands of years (corn, chicken, tomatoes all are transgenic organisms) and that we have Pancreatic DNAse to break down the transgenic gene just like we would metabolize any DNA from cells we ear (fruit, vegetables, meat, etc).

However, the media, many websites that show up on google searches, and books/documentaries that have no scientific citations on the issue are increasing in popularity and causing the issue to become blown out of proportion (in my opinion), often with a lack of respect for the science put into the safety and sustainablilty of GMOs. 

I was wondering what other geneticists though about this issue? I could not find anything on here yet that discussed/debated this issue.
I feel that there is mostly a consensus between geneticists that GMOs are not as harmful as the uninformed public thinks they are, but I was curious to hear from some genetics redditers.

"Given that 46,XY women can be fertile, can they pass on the Y chromosome? ","Sorry if this is a stupid question -- I'm not a biologist/geneticist, and I don't know anything about meiosis or oogenesis. That said, I've been reading the article [Report of Fertility in a Woman with a Predominantly 46,XY Karyotype in a Family with Multiple Disorders of Sexual Development](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2190741/), and one of the many striking things about it is the fact that they didn't take it for granted that the 46,XY daughter inherited her Y chromosome from her father. E.g. it says:

> The analysis of the Y chromosome polymorphism YAP revealed that this insertion was present in the Y chromosome of the mother (defining her Y chromosome haplogroup as D/E), and the insertion was not present in the Y chromosome of the daughter or her father (Fig. 3​3).). These data indicate that the daughter inherited the Y chromosome from her father, and the sequence was identical to that of a normal male.

Was this analysis redundant, or is it possible for a fertile woman with a high proportion of 46,XY chromosomes to have ova that carry the Y chromosome (the article says that the mother's ovaries are 93% 46,XY, but doesn't seem to say anything about her ova)? If so, is it also possible for them to have children with YY chromosomes? I tried Googling this, but the closest thing I've found is 47,XYY syndrome, which is a result of mutation rather than inheritance (according to [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/47xyy-syndrome/#inheritance)).

"""Unclear Female Result"" Array CGH - Possible Disorder of Sex Development 25 AFAB","So, several years ago, I had an Array CGH done because I have a some physical characteristics consistent with some type of DSD, and I was thinking it might be Turner's Syndrome at the time.

I got the results back and have some interstitial deletions and duplications on the autosomes, but it didn't say anything about the sex chromosomes specificially.

The wording was sort of vague though for what was being tested because it said:

""Unclear female result with an interstitial loss of (insert autosome q arm location range here) of uncertain clinical significance and interstitial loss of (insert autosome q arm location range here) of uncertain clinical significance, likely benign.""

A while ago, I did a direct to consumer test which showed around 125 SNPs of the Y chromosome, including part of SRY/TDF, a couple non-pseudoautosomal genes related to spermatogenesis, some genes from the pseudoautosomal region, and some Y-linked haplogroup SNPs that are consistent with my ancestry.

These were pretty scattered fragments, so I don't know if the Array CGH could pick up something like this that could be point mutations essentially.

The SRY/TDF SNP that showed up in the report was rs104894959 (C; C) and is supposedly a pathogenic SNP that is associated with 46, XY sex reversal type 1 and 46, XY true hermaphroditism.

Confusingly the female Genoset gs145 also showed up from the same test, indicating that I have the normal female genotype.

Out of the 125 Y-Chromosome SNPs/rs#'s, most were homozygous (possible miscalls), but a few registered as heterozygous. I am not sure if this was just genetic noise, so to speak.

My mom had almost the exact same result, also showing SRY and Y-Chromosome data. I'd like to add that I was her only child carried to term. She had a hysterectomy a few years ago and they found uterine and ovarian abnormalities, cysts, a leiomyoma, and part of her peritoneum connected to some of the tissue near her ovaries and fallopian tubes, which were previously ligated.

I have borderline high testosterone and was diagnosed with PCOS. I do not have amenorrhea, but I do have short stature, poor breast development, widely spaced nipples, pigmented nevi, sparse pubic hair, and other congenital abnormalities consistent with a type of DSD.

I also am of the opinion that I have a wide neck and cubitis valgus too. I am pretty certain that I have a posterior partial labial fusion as I can only see the clitoris and urethral opening, and no vaginal opening (similar to Prader Scale Stage 2 opening, but more fused, and mixed Stage 1 and 2 clitoris size and shape). The urethral meatus looks lower than it should be and there is possibly mild clitoromegaly.

I have a lot of other health issues, and I don't want to bring this up to my doctor and be dismissed as crazy or a hypochondriac.

From the way the Array CGH result was worded, is there anything more to investigate?

Should I get a karyotype or FISH analysis done, or am I unlikely to need one?

Look I know all of these things can happen as isolated traits even the cataracts, I also know we all have oddities that are ‘rare’ in statistics somewhere but this seems like A-LOT of really off things with no family history. The genetics doc seemed to think because I’m otherwise healthy and active etc without issues there’s unlikely to be anything but my doctor didn’t seem happy with that. I guess any input is appreciated.

Is it possible to genetically modify the color of wood?,"Is it possible to genetically modify something like walnut or maple in such a way that the wood grows as a very dark brown or black color? Ebony is prized for it's black color, but it's becoming endangered due to over-harvesting and illegal logging. If such a tree could be developed, it could be a good substitute for ebony, therefore reducing demand, and helping to alleviate the aforementioned problems.

Is there some gene that makes wood black? If so, could it easily be added to some common hardwood to make *it* black too?

HIV Resistance Genes (CCR5 & rs9264942),"I am new to this thread, but I wanted to see if I could get some insight on this subject. Let's say a person has the CCR5-Delta32 homozygous (less than 1% of European population have this) which makes them virtually immune to the common strains of HIV. In addition to this, that same person also has the homozygous rs9264942 (C;C) genotype (around 10% of European population) which would cause them to have an average of 90% of viral load reduction if they were to somehow contract the virus. Is there any peer reviewed research that discusses the interaction of these two variants? I have been looking everywhere but am having no luck. I thought there may be some folks on this thread that most likely work or have gone to school or are just experienced regarding this subject. Having one of these mutations is already rare as it is, but one person having both seems like it would be worth looking into in my opinion.

How do real life experiences activate certain genes? How do hormones interact with DNA to activate or deactivate certain genes? I’ve heard some people explain that DNA has an outside layer around it... what is that outside layer called?,"There’s a series of studies on rats that lick and groom their pups and how the licking and grooming of rat pups changes their behaviors. The studies address the question of nature vs nurture and ultimately conclude both nature and nurture play a role in determining behaviors. 

Some scientists took it further and switched the rat pups from licking and grooming mothers to non-licking/grooming mothers. Even if a rat pup came from a licking/grooming mother, when it was raised by a non-licking/grooming mom, it didn’t exhibit the licking/grooming behavior in the future. Here we have “nurture.” 

Some scientists looked at it from the perspective of DNA and found that the act of being licked and groomed caused the release of hormones that either activated or didn’t activate genes associated with certain behaviors. 

Looking at humans, (during a Ted Radio Hour podcast) scientists found that serial killers tend to have a particular gene in common. But not all people with the gene become killers. Only those with bad early childhood experiences became killers. 

I found this bit on the American Psychological Association webpage:
https://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/10/epigenetics

How do real life experiences activate certain genes? How does a lack of “nurture” result in the failure to activate certain genes? How do hormones interact with DNA to activate or deactivate certain genes? I’ve heard some people explain that DNA has an outside layer around it... what is that outside layer called?

Was Habsburg chin even caused by inbreeding?,"
This guy is Charles V that was a product of 2 generations of outbreeding with no prior known blood relationship between descendants, so well before their family tree started to look like a circle.

Prognathism is not some super rare 1 in a million recessive gene, it's pretty common dominant gene (like 2-4% of appearing in adults). Obviously with today's medicine it can be fixed to some extent so it doesn't look that bad. Even if you straight up got your sister pregnant, the chances of inheriting a dominant gene jumps from 50% to 75% on average. A significant increase, but far from the cause of them being deformed right?

So isn't Habsburg chin in worst case scenario just a dominant gene that circled back ? Doesn't Charles V paintings disprove them being massively deformed just because of inbreeding? Could someone please help me understand it, because i'm kinda lost with this one. ",https://i.redd.it/919gmsf433wc1.jpeg,genetics,-0.9969360828399658

Please read before posting about BRCA1 mutations,"Hi everyone,

We've gotten a pretty big uptick in posts about pathogenic BRCA1 mutations. Several users have posted rather concerning Genetic Genie results showing that they are homozygous (two copies) for the ""I"" allele (this will show up as ""II"" inside a scary red circle) of rs80357868. We've also seen posts about pathogenic BRCA1 variants in XCode.life reports.

To be clear, for rs80357868, the ""I"" variant is the normal, healthy variant (see [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs80357868) or [SNPedia](https://www.snpedia.com/index.php/Rs80357868)). Almost all individuals will be homozygous for the ""I"" allele. It is the extremely rare deletion (""D"") allele that causes a loss of function in the *BRCA1* gene and increases breast cancer risk. Genetic Genie incorrectly reported the ""I"" allele as pathogenic. I've emailed them about this issue, and to their credit, they've been very responsive and have reported that they've fixed the interpretation issues.

There appears to be a similar issue with XCode.life, where they're reporting that people have multiple, homozygous pathogenic variants in BRCA1. From what I can tell, these calls stem from a similar issue where normal/healthy variants are being incorrectly interpreted by XCode.life as pathogenic. *BRCA1* mutations are extremely rare and generally lethal when homozygous, so the odds of a healthy adult having a single homozygous *BRCA1* mutation, let alone multiple, are almost zero.

Going forward, we're going to be removing posts concerning obviously erroneous health results from these direct-to-consumer interpretation services.

I'm also going to take this opportunity to soapbox for a bit. Please note that generally speaking, consumer-oriented genetic tests (including those provided by 23andMe) and interpretation services like Promethease, Genetic Genie, XCode.life, etc. should not be relied upon to diagnose disease. There are serious concerns about the specificity of these tests and the automated interpretation tools (case in point here) and their sensitivity (e.g., 23andMe's *BRCA* panel only covers 3 *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* variants common in Ashkenazi Jews). Diagnoses should be made by licensed healthcare professionals who can review the totality of clinical and genetic evidence for a given patient.

Moderating this sub: new/updated rules and policies,"Hi everyone. /r/genetics has a new ~~benign overlord~~ friendly moderator. *waves*

I'm making a meta post to announce some changes that I've implemented/will implement to the automod and the rules, and to solicit feedback on how you all want to see this sub moderated and what we can do to try to drum up some higher quality posts/discussion (maybe a weekly/biweekly/monthly literature/historical topic/method review?).

**(1) Automod:** I think a lot of people are pretty frustrated with the lack of moderation and the resulting proliferation of low quality/spam posts in this sub, so I'm looking to implement some changes to the automod (and have a more active, carbon-based moderator). Specifically, automod is currently set up with the following rules:

* ""homework"" -> remove, redirect to monthly homework thread.
* ""eye color"" (and similar terms) -> remove, redirect to wiki/FAQ.
* ""blood type"" -> remove, redirect to wiki/FAQ
* account age <48 hrs, comment karma <10 -> remove.

The mods can see all removed posts, including the ones culled by automod, so we can manually approve posts if they seem like they're not completely basic/low effort. I will likely also add filters for hair color, skin color, and height (or at the very least add a rule stating that mods will delete low effort posts concerning topics addressed in the FAQ (see (3)).

**(2) Redirecting to HW/personal genetics megathreads/FAQ:** Current policy is to remove posts concerning personal genetics, obvious homework questions, and questions that are addressed in the FAQ and redirecting them as appropriate. Is this something that we all want to continue? I'm generally in favor of removing low effort/uninteresting posts like ""my parents are brunettes but I have ginger hairs in my beard??"" or ""??? *posts blurry picture of a Punnett square*"", but I'd like to get your guy's thoughts on where to draw the line. Obviously there'll be moderator discretion here, but which posts do you all want to see hard redirected? Do we want to let through personal genetics or homework questions that I (or the other mods ... we'll have to hold a recruitment event) think will generate useful discussion?

**(3) Rewriting the FAQ/wiki:** Something that should be done. It's currently missing a lot of important FAQs (hair color, the height section is super short, ancestry testing, race, SNPs/variants vs genes, etc.), and the section on blood types is kind of bloated. Also, does anyone want to volunteer to help write/edit this? Or find good, lay-accessible sources?

**(4) Increased moderation of specific topics:** mRNA vaccines, race, eugenics, and evolution are the main ones that I think we'll have to watch out for trolls on. These topics all have a history of attracting combative users and misinformation, so I think thread discussing these topics should face increased scrutiny. Maybe we should add a rule specifically stating that combative/rude/belligerent posts concerning these topics will be removed.

**(5) Recruiting additional mods:** Something I'll discuss with /u/labbrat, the sub founder, but we'll need to recruit a few more active mods. I'd like to see people who have some level of professional or postgraduate experience in genetics or related fields, and it'll be good to have people with diverse backgrounds (especially if we implement a regular literature/historical topics/methods discussion series).

**(6) Feedback please:** How do you want to see this sub moderated? Is there anything I've left off? Are there changes you don't want to see?",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/y1nj6h/moderating_this_sub_newupdated_rules_and_policies/,genetics,-0.999005138874054

Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease,"TW: Infant loss.

Hey, y'all. When I was 32 weeks pregnant with my daughter, we had to do an anatomy scan because I had contracted COVID and they wanted to make sure that she was still developing appropriately. That was when they made the discovery of her abnormal kidneys and little to no amniotic fluid. Fast forward a week and we went to Children's Mercy and they diagnosed her with ARPKD amongst other things, related to the nonfunctional kidneys ( pulmonary hypoplasia). Fast forward one more week and she's born. She lives for 4 hours and 25 minutes before passing in our arms. They were able to get a viable sample from our daughter and then later our genetic kits. 

Today, 4 months after the birth of our daughter, the geneticist calls and says she's got the results. My fiance and I are both carriers of PKHD1 and any natural conceived child has a 25% chance of having ARPKD.  The geneticist did give us options of either a placental biopsy at 12 weeks to determine if the fetus has the disease or IVF. 

I'm not super sure why I'm posting here other than.. well, it's genetics and this is terrifying. I've got two children from previous relationships and my fiance has none.

"My genes were tested for cancer, but I think I’m not related to my family now","I have an iffy history with my family of origin. My parents have always been very cagey about my family’s history. There’s been an open joke that I was switched at birth, and I’ve seen strong evidence that supports that. There’s not a lot I know about them, or myself.

I know that my dad‘s sister and both grandmas got breast cancer around the age that I am now. My aunt got herself genetically tested and she is definitely positive for breast cancer gene markers. 

I’m currently in the initial stages of breast cancer screening/treatment. I have an egg shaped lump in my right breast, physical symptoms, and blood tests all indicated positive results for breast cancer, and genetic testing was another element.

51 different markers were tested and I got a perfect zero for all of them. Wow, that’s good news for me, I’m not sure that it will affect my treatment any because you can obviously get breast cancer without jeans for it. 

Obviously, the big question this raises for me is that I may not be related to the people I consider my family. I realize that a single marker test isn’t the same as a full-blown paternity test. But considering there was so much open suspicion in my life and I now have something I can hold in my hands that would support that suspicion. 

I’m not sure what to do now. I’ve long avoided any genetic tests, anything to do with ancestry.com or any of that stuff. I’ve been estranged from my family for more than a decade. I wouldn’t be sad knowing that I’m not a part of their genetic material. But strangely it’s incredibly painful to think if I wasn’t at the same time. 

I got a solid grip in the basics of genetics Via college biology classes more than 20 years ago so I’m sure I’m forgetting/missing knowledge. Aside from getting fully genetically tested, and then reaching out to my parents to do the same, am I overreacting about interpreting these results?

TLDR: cancer screening turned up unexpected (but good) results that leads me to believe I’m not genetically related to my family. Am I overreacting? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/1einfo9/my_genes_were_tested_for_cancer_but_i_think_im/,genetics,0.8094576597213745
Races and needle stick pain ,"Hello!, I am a PCT at a hospital and am looking to be a doctor so this question is pure curiosity about the people around me. I live in the south and work on a surgical recovery floor for oncology patients. We have a pretty evenly mixed population of black and white patients and nurses. I watch IVs, glucose monitoring, and blood draws to sign off on my experience sheet since I'm doing a internship type job.

I found that our black patients seem to be in a lot more pain when we prick them. I read a lot about uncertainty in the black community with medicine Becuase it's predominantly white a lot of places and Becuase of malpractice rates. But it doesn't look like fear and not a ton of nervousness before we start. I usually talk them through it and hold their hand while the nurse does her thing. I was wondering if this is genetic. 

I read people with more Neanderthal DNA have a gene called SCN9A in sensory neurons that makes people have a lower pain threshold in patients with this gene. My family on both sides have some higher percentage of Neanderthal and most of us have trouble with pain with needles. I don't get nervous when I get blood drawn but am in a lot of pain as well. The nurse drawing my blood at my TB test for worked was worried bc I was turning a little white from pain. 

I was wondering if these was any correlation or research to find this out. I am non black myself and hope this comes off respectfully Becuase I want to practice the best I can if I become a doctor. I've seen more studies on different diseases and how they effect different races but I'm not sure if we have done enough research for races other than white  or even for women yet! Thanks!

Or even as big as 40% from one grandparent?

"East-Eurasian: A term used in population genomics to refer to East Asian-related populations. In this post, I will discuss the basics about the genetic grouping known as East-Eurasians, their history, and some other interesting facts.","**East-Eurasian** is a term used in population genomics to refer to “**East Asian-related populations**”, such as Southeast Asians or Northern Asians and Siberians. It also includes population groups predominantly descending from these East Asian-related populations, such as modern Central Asians or Native Americans.

East-Eurasian should not be confused with “*eastern non-Africans*”, which refers to any ethno-linguistic group which used the eastern route, specifically East-Eurasians, and South-Eurasians (Oceanian/Papuan-related populations).

[The migration routes of human lineages, according to the advanced Out-of-Africa theory.](https://preview.redd.it/bpalcj3c0ol71.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c6f98f2533328e54ad805fa0f12c5eec6e84eb9)

East-Eurasians (in anthropologic studies historically known as “*Mongoloids*”) did originate and expanded from **Paleolithic Mainland Southeast Asia**. A hypothese about an Siberian or Arctic origin of East-Eurasians is generally seen as obsolete, because East-Eurasians used the southern Himalayan route into Mainland Southeast Asia, rather than a northern Himalayan route through Central Asia. Northern Siberia/Eurasia was in fact first populated by a deeply European-related lineage, which was subsequently replaced by several waves of East-Eurasian groups.

[Population structure during the Paleolithic; Ancient North Eurasians formed as result of West-Eurasian and East-Eurasian groups merging. “ANE” is estimated to have \~73&#37; West-Eurasian ancestry \[mostly maternal\] and \~27&#37; East-Eurasian ancestry \[mostly paternal\].](https://preview.redd.it/l8qamfvd0ol71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=6047a17137c74664787f466e7ecd26edfa7331aa)

East-Eurasians (East Asian-related people) can be demonstatively traced back as distinct ancestry lineage more than 50,000BC to Mainland Southeast Asia. From there, East-Eurasian ancestry (East Asian-related ancestry) spreaded northwards and southwards respectively.

As such, East Asian-related groups, such as Northeast Asians, Southeast Asians, Siberians, but also Native Americans, descend from a source population in Mainland Southeast Asia.

**Here we see the arrival of East-Eurasians to Mainland Southeast Asia and their later dispersal southwards, spreading East Asian-related ancestry:**

[Spread of East-Eurasian and later Basal East Asian populations from Mainland Southeast Asia southwards. East Asian-related ancestry expanded multiple times southwards into Insular Southeast Asia as early as 50,000BC, demonstratively since 25,000BC, much early than previously suggeted. \[Larena et al. 2021\]](https://preview.redd.it/zqt13hjg0ol71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0de8379f2735c55c818bab2eef3ba27394cebe1)

Eurasians (East Asian-related people) are distinct from the slightly earlier wave into Insular Southeast Asia and Oceania, known as “*Australasians*”, “*Sahulians*”, or simply “*South-Eurasians*”.

Replacement through, and geneflow from East-Eurasians into these South-Eurasian groups happened already between 25,000 up to 50,000 years ago. Further, East Asian-related ancestry was **far more widespreaded** than previously suggested. It was found that East Asian-related ancestry dominated Insular Southeast Asia (ISEA) **already since 15,000 BC, long before the expansion of Austroasiatic and Austronesian populations.**

**Larena et al. 2021** concluded that the spread of East Asian-related ancestry was much earlier than previously suggested. Insular Southeast Asia was already dominated by East Asian-related ancestry at \~15,000BC, long before the expansion of Austronesian-speakers, which dominate Insular Southeast Asia today.

The authors also found that previous suggestions of an South-Eurasian (previously known as ""Australo-Melanesian"") presence in large parts of Mainland Southeast Asia and southernmost China are obsolete. The genetic data does not support the presence or admixture of South-Eurasian lineages in ancient samples of southern China, such as the Liangdao (2) sample. In contrary, the presence of East Asian-related lineages in ancient Insular Southeast Asian and Oceanian samples suggest that the previous found affinity can be explained by early expansion of Basal-East Asian lineages from Mainland Southeast Asia.

Similarly, **Carlhoff et al. 2021** concluded that the fact that Basal-East Asian ancestry is detected at high frequency among Holocene hunter-gatherer samples in South-Sulawesi, show that the expansion of East Asian-related ancestry predates the expansion of rice-agriculturalists as well as the expansion of Austroasiatic and Austronesian groups respectively. Hoabinhian samples from Penisular Malaysia were found to have \~75% East Asian-related ancestry, while a Hoabinhian classified hunter-gatherer sample in South-Sulawesi had \~50% East Asian-related ancesry. More about that later.

**Here the two scenarios for the northwards expansion of East-Eurasian lineages:**

[Northwards expansion of early East-Eurasians. The famous Jomon culture of Japan originated from such East-Eurasian population, however also recived some geneflow from a deeply-European-related lineage from Northern Siberia, which is not found in other East-Eurasian groups. The Jomon were an East Asian-related population, but on Hokkaido, merged with an earlier Upper-Paleolithic population, deeply related to Europeans.](https://preview.redd.it/wnjxue4r0ol71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=54200648e9040b3e2c93593677810ca5af3736f8)

The northwards expansion reached Northeast Asia quite fast and populated all of East Asia, Northeast Asia and northeastern Siberia respectively. Evidence for East Asian-related ancestry is dated back to 45,000BC, samplified by the Tianyuan sample. There may be earlier presence of East-Eurasians, but currently, Tianyuan is the oldest sample in northern East Asia.

[Tianyuan is often modeled Basal to all East-Eurasians, but Larena et al. 2021 modeled Tianyuan as an offshot of the Basal-East Asian source population in Mainland Southeast Asia. This means the Tianyuan sample is simply a sample closer to Basal-East Asians, similarly as ancient Jomon samples, or modern Himalayan Kusunda samples, an endangered ethno-linguistic group in Nepal.](https://preview.redd.it/lmemh0on5ol71.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf3d1f63d002fcb7f86a23651ca4a0c8589489e2)

[Basal-East Asians obviously had darker skin than many modern East Asian-related groups. Southeast Asians and Native Americans retained slightly darker average skin tones. The Kusunda give us an example about the Ancestral East Asians.](https://preview.redd.it/dsl0pu9m6ol71.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=38f1efc3e92119e82344b74d82a1ac397066f466)

**Genetically speaking, the Kusunda are close in PCA charts to Jomon samples and Tianyuan.**

Sadly, the Kusunda are nearly extinct, their language only spoken by the elders, and the few young Kusundas increasingly assimilated into the majority population. The Kusunda were an isolated Himalayan hunter-gatherer population, and did not underwent admixture with Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burmese migrants.

**Now some further information about the population history of Eurasia and the impact of East-Eurasian expansion from Mainland Southeast Asia:**

All modern and ancient Australasian/South-Eurasian samples have varying amounts of East Asian-related admixture. This is in accordance to previous studies which found that modern Negrito tribes have between 30% to 65% East Asian-related ancestry. The Andamanese Onge as example were found to have approximately 30% East Asian-related ancestry (range between 6% and 45%). \[**Chaubey et al. 2015, Narasimhan et al. 2019, Liu et al. 2020, Carlhoff et al. 2021**\]

The Andamanese people, which were previously suggested to be rather isolated from outside influence, were found to have rather high East Asian-related ancestry and are shifted towards East Asians, compared to with Papuans.

>***Onge***\*: 67.54% Oceanic, 0.98% Melano\_Polynesian,\* ***13.57% EA, 13.21% S\_EA***\*.\* ***28.55% East Eurasian*** *(****\~30% shared drift with “East Asians***\*) and the N-S cline for the East Eurasian ancestry is 0.6882.\*  
*It’s worth pointing out that MDLP K23b models modern-day Onge always as being “part East Asian” and not just some combination of AASI-like “S\_Indian”, “Australoid”, and “Melano\_Polynesian”.*

**Genome of a middle Holocene hunter-gatherer from Wallacea ‘Leang Panninge’:**

*Carlhoff, S., Duli, A., Nägele, K. et al. Genome of a middle Holocene hunter-gatherer from Wallacea.* ***Nature*** *596*\*\*\*,\*\*\* *543–547 (2021).*

A 2021 study, about ancient Hoabinhian hunter-gatherers, Andamanese Onge, Australasians (Papuans and Aboriginal Australians) and East-Eurasian, including a new sample of an Neolithic hunter-gatherer woman in South Sulawesi, Wallacea, eastern Indonesia, revealed further information about the peopling of Insular Southeast Asia, and the impact of East Asian-related populations.

[In southern Sulawesi, a Holocene hunter-gatherer sample was analyzed.](https://preview.redd.it/3ax6o3pm9ol71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e7a1f017712237eaac93bf5e4b4d7e61ab29498)

The study results found that the new ‘Leang Panninge’ Neolithic hunter-gatherer sample, which dates to 7,300 BC has surprisingly high East-Eurasian (termed “Basal-East Asian) ancestry at \~50%. The previous Hoabinhian samples were found to be even closer to East Asian cline (*Pha Faen in Laos, dated to 7939–7751 calibrated years before present (yr cal BP; present taken as AD 1950), and Gua Cha in Malaysia (4.4–4.2 kyr cal BP)*) with \~75% East Asian-related ancestry.

[PCA chart, showing the East-Eurasian and South-Eurasian cluster, with intermediated populations forming a cline. This cline is the result of East-Eurasian geneflow into South-Eurasian populations.](https://preview.redd.it/gu5nf9bo9ol71.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dc7fd2f3ba6c3755219e4d475d36329fd8f42d9)

>*The qpGraph analysis confirmed this branching pattern, with the Leang Panninge individual branching off from the Near Oceanian clade after the Denisovan gene flow, although with the most supported topology indicating around* **50% of a basal East Asian component contributing to the Leang Panninge genom***e (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Figs. 7–11).*

More recently, Austroasiatic and Austronesian expansions into Insular Southeast Asia:

https://preview.redd.it/ruhbki1q9ol71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f5820a3506cd09f752fc57176e9cf6ea34f7493

The **northward expansion** of East-Eurasians shaped the population history of Siberia and Central Asia massively. East-Eurasians also left some influence on the formation of modern Europeans.

[Karafet et al., Mayat et al., Tumonggor et al., and Hallast et al. 2020 “Early replacement of West Eurasian male Y chromosomes from the East”](https://preview.redd.it/j68sl59r9ol71.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a6b44334c301feb586537023bc6dbf296915965)

A **37,000 year old sample found in modern day Romania**, southeastern Europe, was found to be **genetically closer to East Asians than to Europeans** (the sample had both European and East Asian ancestry but clearly shifted towards East Asians). A reconstruction by European scientists based on anthropology and genetic data showed that this sample had East Asian like phenotypes which correspond to the closer relation to East Asians rather than Europeans:

https://preview.redd.it/bq5ip02t9ol71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b022ae7405314af2748649e4170fda8a886004d

One of the more recent East-Eurasian waves into Europe is **Uralic**:

[The homeland of proto-Uralic and their expansion westwars, spreading Uralic languages.](https://preview.redd.it/r7tg3kbu9ol71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed1c35590b865303e4b5b6351b294c743d3495b4)

>*We further estimated the genetic composition in these populations using qpAdm3. All ancient and modern individuals from the Baltics, Finland and Russia were successfully modelled as a mixture of five lines of ancestry, represented by eastern Mesolithic hunter-gatherers (EHG, from Karelia), Yamnaya from Samara, LBK from the early European Neolithic, western Mesolithic hunter-gatherers (WHG, from Spain, Luxembourg and Hungary), and Nganasan, or subsets of those five (Supplementary Data 4). In contrast to previous models for European populations using three streams of ancestry2,3, we found that some populations modelled here require two additional components: a component related to modern Nganasans, as discussed above, and additional EHG ancestry, not explained by Yamnaya (who have been shown to contain large amounts of EHG ancestry themselves3). Indeed, the six Bolshoy individuals have substantial amounts of EHG but no Yamnaya ancestry. We find that Nganasan-related ancestry is significantly present in all of our ancient samples except for Levänluhta\_B, and in many modern, mainly Uralic-speaking populations. The 3500-year-old ancient individuals from Bolshoy represent the highest proportion of Siberian Nganasan-related ancestry seen in this region so far, and possibly evidence its earliest presence in the western end of the trans-Siberian expanse (Fig. 4). The geographically proximate ancient hunter-gatherers from the Baltics (6000 and 6300 BC) and Motala (\~ 6000 BC), who predate Bolshoy, lack this component, as do late Neolithic and Bronze Age individuals from the Baltics7,8,45.*

[Ngnasan as representative for East-Eurasian ancestry.](https://preview.redd.it/rnmpr13w9ol71.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=71a77bae8d2e03da5dcec6c0e81010ddab6b842a)

Another influental wave from Northeast Asia was **Turkic**:

[Uchiyama et al. 2020](https://preview.redd.it/9pw5acry9ol71.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeb24c918a88d88a7ce8698f9befe6d94e6db1e6)

>*Recent DNA studies show that starting from the end of the second millennium BCE, the East Asian-related components were already found in numerous populations in Central Asia and Eastern Europe (Narasimhan et al., 2019). By the Iron Age, populations (e.g. Xiongnu) with primarily East Asian ancestry moved westward on a large scale, which combined in different proportions with local populations who were originally Indo-European speakers with largely west Eurasian ancestry that shifted their languages to Turkic (Damgaard et al., 2018). Modern DNA of multiple Turkic populations showed that the Turkic peoples shared their ancestry with populations from southern Siberia and Mongolia, supporting the hypothesis that they originated there (Yunusbayev et al., 2015; Tambets et al. 2018). Although current genetic evidence is not adequate to track the exact time and location for the origin of the proto-Turkic language, it is clear that it probably originated somewhere in northeastern Asia given the fact that the nomadic groups, such as the Rouran, Xiongnu and the Xianbei, all share a substratum genetic ancestry that falls into or close to the northeast Asian gene pool (Ning et al., in press; Li et al., 2018).*

**Damgaard et al. 2018: pp. 1/intro and 4–5.**

>*“These historical events transformed the Eurasian steppes from being inhabited by Indo-European speakers of largely West Eurasian ancestry to the mostly Turkic-speaking groups of the present day, who are primarily of East Asian ancestry.”*  
*…*  
*“These results suggest that Turkic cultural customs were* ***imposed by an East Asian minority elite*** *onto central steppe nomad populations… The wide distribution of the Turkic languages from Northwest China, Mongolia and Siberia in the east to Turkey and Bulgaria in the west implies large-scale migrations out of the homeland in Mongolia.”*

**The peopling of the Americas:**

[Native Americans are predominantly East-Eurasian genetically speaking, but they also absorbed some \[maternal\] West-Eurasian ancestry during their early migration through northern Siberia into the Americas.](https://preview.redd.it/egb9mfv1aol71.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=d47ccdb9307ac1cc1af85007cda74076c951614f)

Can genetic engineering affect an adult individual within their lifetime?,"For example, if one uses a plasmid to get a certain gene into a cell’s DNA, then only that one cell and its descendants will have that gene. In an adult, one cell and its descendants will make up a tiny fraction of the total amount of cells in any given area of the body, and so that new gene will probably not result in any major physiological changes. 

So how do we genetically engineer individuals? Do we just send the gene to multiple different cells in the area of interest? If so, do we have an efficient way of doing this?

Or is genetic engineering only viable in fetuses and children in early development?",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/j51po6/can_genetic_engineering_affect_an_adult/,genetics,-0.9992724061012268

Synthetic genes were flanked by BsaI restriction sites designed to leave AATG-GCTT overhangs, compatible with the existing modular cloning standard described in ref. 14. Each gene was then cloned into Level 1-like vector, under the control of the constitutive 35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus and ocs terminator from *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*. These Level 1 plasmids were then digested by BpiI and assembled together into a Level 2-like backbone in the following order: *nnhisps-nnh3h-nnluz-nncph* or, in the case of *cph*\-less version, *nnhisps-nnh3h-nnluz*. This gene cluster was preceded by a kanamycin resistance cassette for selection in plants. The entire construct, consisting of the kanamycin cassette plus luminescence genes, was flanked by *A. tumefaciens* insertion sequences to facilitate *Agrobacterium*\-mediated random integration of the construct into plant genomes (Supplementary Fig. 2).  
>  
>All clonings described above were performed according to established Golden Gate cloning methods, wherein digestion and ligation are performed together in a single step. All reactions were performed in 1× T4 ligase buffer (Thermo Fisher) containing 10 U of T4 ligase, 20 U of either BsaI or BpiI (Thermo Fisher) and 100 ng of DNA of each DNA part. Golden Gate reactions were performed according to “troubleshooting” cycling conditions described in ref. 15: 25 cycles between 37 °C and 16 °C (90 s at 37 °C, 180 s at 16 °C) and then 5 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 80 °C.  
>  
>Correct sequences of all plasmids were confirmed with Sanger and Illumina sequencing before use (Supplementary Data).

When ordering synthetic genes, do they come as plasmids? If so, what's the code of the rest of the plasmid? I've looked into golden gate cloning a lot, so that should be interesting to figure out if I have to construct this myself. If I don't have to order the parts individually, that would be amazing, but I'm assuming I can't just do that because this paper would've done so if that was an option. Also, does anyone know of any free codon optimization software or free through an institution? Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have access to a lab btw, but I do have to have everything figured out before I can ask permission to do this project.

A phylogenetic family tree of humans and the story of our all ancestors,"As the title already says, this post is about the phylogenetic relationship between different modern and archaic human populations. A simplified but up-to-date schematic can be seen below:

[The phylogenetic family tree of humans; the history of our all ancestors.](https://preview.redd.it/wu86rfes05jc1.png?width=3659&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa6d246f82ba81a028cb07dcbb766951cc1fa3f4)

As most people will know, modern humans originated in Africa, and expanded outgoing from the African continent. The majority of deep divergences happened before the Out of Africa migration (c. 70kya). This also includes deep archaic human lineages such as an ""archaic ghost"" lineage which may have contributed some ancestry to later humans, but also the even deeper homo lineages of the Denisovans and Neanderthals, which populated wide areas of Eurasia viz. homo heidelbergensis, and contributed low amounts of ancestry to all modern Eurasian populations (2-3% Neanderthal ancestry among all Eurasians with a peak among East Asian and Australasian groups; and 1-7% Denisovan ancestry among Eastern Eurasians, with a peak among Australasian groups).

The main modern human lineage ancestral to all living humans emerged around 300,000-500,000 years ago. The oldest modern human identified remains are dated to c. 300,000 years ago. There is some evidence for the beginning of modern behavior among early African H. sapiens around that period. Evidence of early stone-tipped projectile weapons (a characteristic tool of Homo sapiens), the stone tips of javelins or throwing spears, were discovered in 2013 at the Ethiopian site of Gademotta, and date to around 279,000 years ago. Beads and other personal ornamentation have been found from Morocco which might be as much as 130,000 years old. In 2008, an ochre processing workshop likely for the production of paints was uncovered dating to c. 100,000 years ago at Blombos Cave, South Africa. Evidence also exists for the systematic heat treating of silcrete stone to increase its flake-ability for the purpose of toolmaking, beginning approximately 164,000 years ago at the South African site of Pinnacle Point. Humans in North Africa (Nazlet Sabaha, Egypt) are known to have dabbled in chert mining, as early as c. 100,000 years ago, for the construction of stone tools.

Evidence was found in 2018, dating to about 320,000 years ago, at the Kenyan site of Olorgesailie, of the early emergence of modern behaviors including: long-distance trade networks (involving goods such as obsidian), the use of pigments, and the possible making of projectile points. The evidence of these behaviors is approximately contemporary to the earliest known Homo sapiens fossil remains from Africa (such as at Jebel Irhoud and Florisbad), and they suggest that complex and modern behaviors had already begun in Africa around the time of the emergence of anatomically modern Homo sapiens. In 2019, further evidence of early complex projectile weapons in Africa was found at Aduma, Ethiopia, dated 100,000–80,000 years ago, in the form of points considered likely to belong to darts delivered by spear throwers.

[Reconstruction of the to date oldest modern human remains; c. 315,000 years ago.](https://preview.redd.it/3ng9bceqm5jc1.jpg?width=2456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c72debe664748c03c223db3ad030cddad89e566)

Around 250,000 to 200,000 years ago, the first major split among modern humans happened, with the ancestors of South African hunter-gatherers (SAHG aka Khoisan-like) and Central African/Rainforest hunter-gatherers (CAHG/RHG aka Pygmy-like) diverging from the rest of modern humans. Both deep lineages rapidly diverged from each other and remained isolated from other groups for a very long time.

[Khoi & San hunter-gatherers of Southern Africa; SAHG](https://preview.redd.it/r90ykdu236jc1.png?width=1099&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b44f8d145cd199d1fc7f2c8f497d3d001d62143)

Some time later, approximately 100,000 years ago, a group of local Northeastern Africans, the later ancestors of all modern Eurasians, diverged from the yet undifferentiated main African population cluster (excluding already diverged SAHG and CAHG), giving rise to the today dominant major lineages within Eurasia and the Americas.

[This group would later became the ancestors of all modern Eurasians: Europeans, Middle Easterners, South Asians, Australasians, East Asians, and Native Americans.](https://preview.redd.it/1d5wbizns5jc1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa09190c5ae3ca7ea13513572ef53c13bde71b66)

It is suggested that they migrated Out of Africa around 70,000 years ago, arriving to the Middle East, specifically the Arab peninsula. It is possible that a branch of these Proto-Eurasians stayed in Northern Africa, becoming the ""Ancient North African"" lineage, althought others associate this ghost lineage with a branch of the West/East African cluster (discussed later):

[Reconstruction of an Ancient North African specimen, either a sister lineage to Eurasians or closer to West\/East African lineages](https://preview.redd.it/yv5ugmnw06jc1.jpg?width=3978&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd5b94bdab2c5fef0bf7a90d8c438cc1845eff0f)

The **Ancestral Eurasians** which migrated Out of Africa stayed for around 10,000 years in the Arab peninsula and slowly started to diversify there, resulting in the formation of:

* **Basal Eurasians** indigenous to the Arab peninsula (diverging from remaining Eurasians around 60kya)
* **Eastern Eurasians** expanding during the Initial Upper Paleolithic period (IUP) throughout Eurasia (giving rise to modern East Asians, indigenous South Asians, and Australasians/Melanesians)
* **Western Eurasians** expanding during the Upper Paleolithic period (UP) into Europe, Central Asia and Siberia as well as the Middle East and Northern Africa, absorbing earlier Basal Eurasians and certain deeply diverged local East Eurasian populations

The **Early East Eurasians** (or IUP wave) developed phenotypical traits ancestral to later ""Mongoloid"", ""Veddoid"", and ""Australoid"" groups (for the ones who try to link old/historical classifications with modern data):

[Forensic reconstruction of the Oase2 specimen \(c. 41kya\); Basal East Eurasian](https://preview.redd.it/29dldjzdx5jc1.jpg?width=1215&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=672758c052f063e7c588b90e20e50a0232dbceb6)

[Possible migration scenarios of the IUP movement ancestral to East Eurasians. The southern route model is the academic concensus, but some prefer the northern route model, which may include all modern East Eurasians or specific branches.](https://preview.redd.it/bwz6nyq9y5jc1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=21a5ec98e3d10c98b1afc2e6edd43068a6582fc2)

Archaeogenetic data support model 2, the southern route; however Vallini et al. 2022 noted the possibility that Australasians as a whole (eg. ancestral Papuans and Australians/Melanesians) formed by the admixture of Tianyuan/EAS-like ancestry and a deeper Eurasian ancestry, which may lend support to a possible northern/southern divergence at the IUP eastwards expansion:

>Taken together with a lower bound of the final settlement of Sahul at 37 kya it is reasonable to describe Papuans as either an almost even mixture between East-Eurasians and a lineage basal to West and East-Eurasians which occurred sometimes between 45 and 38kya, or as a sister lineage of East-Eurasians with or without a minor basal OoA or xOoA contribution.

https://preview.redd.it/rgwdwcqry5jc1.png?width=1424&format=png&auto=webp&s=b86d8679ffddb30a39557acd983542efaf908673

As matter of concensus, the southern route model is the better supported and alignes better with known data on the early human dispersals. The northern IUP sites, such as the Kara Bom site, are likely to be associated with the deep Ust’Ishim lineage, which is generally regarded to have went extinct, without any significant contributions to modern populations.

The **Early West Eurasians** are associated with Upper Paleolithic Europeans and populations around the Caucasus and Anatolia. To their South, the population consisted primarily of the Basal Eurasian lineage. Modern West Eurasians are primarily the result of admixture between Upper Paleolithic European and Basal Eurasian Arabian lineages. The development of ""Caucasoid"" phenotypes is rooted in this combination or both parent clades harbored already similar traits which later developed into the regional observed traits.

Natufian phenotypes were primarily Basal Eurasian:

[Natufians derived up to 70&#37; Basal Eurasian ancestry \(LN average was 50\/50\)](https://preview.redd.it/0mik4oei16jc1.jpg?width=680&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5fd6eb376c6fc918a2e71cb00401f8687702f156)

Among modern populations, Basal Eurasian ancestry peaks among Arabs (such as Qataris) at c. 45%, and among Iranian populations at c. 35%, and is also found in significant amounts among modern Northern Africans, in accordance with the high affinity towards the 'Arabian branch' of Eurasian diversity, which expanded into Northern and Northeastern Africa between 30 and 15 thousand years ago. Modern populations of the Levant derive between 35-38% ancestry from Basal Eurasians, modern Anatolians and populations from the Caucasus derive between 25-30% ancestry from Basal Eurasians, and modern Europeans derive around 20% ancestry from Basal Eurasians.

**Remaining African cluster of Western and Eastern African lineages:**

The African populations which stayed in Eastern Africa developed into the West/East African branch of humans, forming the dominant population cluster of modern Africa. They diverged into these specific sub-branches:

* Eastern African hunter-gatherers (EAHG, isolated hunter-gatherer socities in the Horn of Africa)
* ancestors of West African-derived Niger-Congo and Bantu speaking populations
* ancestors of East African/Sahelian-derived Nilo-Saharan speaking populations
* possible the Ancient North African ghost lineage (*while Lazaridis 2018 argues that this branch is closer to Eurasians, subsequent papers described this lineage to share higher affinity with West/East Africans, but received later Eurasian-related geneflow*).

[Phylogenetic tree of African lineages](https://preview.redd.it/jgptq8j546jc1.png?width=2004&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3ada0ab4375733114cc104fa1e0cbfe3622d7cf)

The ancestors of Niger-Congo speaking and Nilo-Saharan speaking populations form the today dominant population within Africa. This dominance was further strengthened by a recent Neolithic expansion affecting most parts of Africa. The speakers of Proto-Niger-Congo and Proto-Nilo-Saharan are inferred to have diverged around 28,000 years ago.[\[1\]](https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/27/R2/R209/4993963) They may have formed a single ""*Trans-Sahelian*"" lineage and unity prior to 28kya.

>The separation of the Afro-Asiatic speakers currently living in north and east Africa from other sub-Saharan African (SSA) populations has been dated to about 50 kya (28). The final major separation is suggested to be between the Nilo-Saharan and Niger-Congo speakers dated to ∼28 kya (28).

The origin of Afroasiatic languages remains disputed, it may be derived from Eurasian back-migrations or alternatively from Eastern African hunter-gatherers (EAHG).

[Niger-Congo and Nilo-Saharan languages in green tones](https://preview.redd.it/ccg9dedf86jc1.png?width=405&format=png&auto=webp&s=058b0fb4a1129d3f446ac6e719d25620b29de123)

While the population of Africa as whole is the most genetically diverse, it doesn't mean all African groups are equally diverse. The dominant West/East African Niger-Congo/Bantu and Nilo-Saharan speaking populations of Africa are less diverse; comparable to the diversity among European/West Asian Indo-European speakers, while the Khoisan and Mbuti/Biaka hunter-gatherers display far more genetic diversity than all of the Eurasian populations.

In this regard, a global Principial component analysis (PCA) can show us the modern human genetic diveristy in one graphic:

**Conclusions**

The phylogenetic family of humans is characterized by a shared ancestor around 300,000 years ago and subsequent divergence, migration and isolation patterns, with later admixture events, resulting in the today observed human genetic lineages.

**Broadly speaking, we have:**

* South African hunter-gatherers
* Central African hunter-gatherers
* West/East Africans
* West Eurasians
* East Eurasians

And all the other populations which are positioned along the different clines between these major clusters.

In this regard, by acknowledging our deep shared ancestry, it must be said that there is no scientific basis for racism or supremacism of specific population groups, nor does it make sense to look down on other human/cultural groups (literally cousin lineages). It is just ignorant and disrespectfull, revealing a weak character. As such, I hope this post helps to better understand the human genetic diversity and our all ancestral history.

It is not wrong to be proud about ones recent ancestors, lineage, heritage, and culture, but one must keep this deeper history in mind, and be respectfull to all other groups. We are after all one big family!

"I am the creator of a popular genetics mod, and need some help!","Hello! I'm the creator of a very popular genetics mod for the game Crusader Kings 2 called 'Improved Genetics.'

Unfortunately my own knowledge of genetics has never been exceptional and doesn't go beyond introductory university level. And while I'm currently working on the CK3 version of this mod, I want to add some stuff to it but am wondering if they have any basis in reality.

For instance, (Game of Thrones spoilers ahead) in A Song of Ice and Fire, there is a line 'The Seed is Strong' that is used to justify why one family line always passes black hair.

However, in normal inheritance, say recessive inheritance for example, if you married someone who doesn't have that recessive gene (say Aa), then there is a 50% or so chance that they lose that gene.

So what exactly does it mean that 'the seed is strong.' And how would I go about modelling that certain genes are 'stronger' in certain families? Finally, is it even realistic?

Autism and Epigenetic,"My son has a genetic duplication on 3p13 the genes FOXP1 and FOXP1-AS1 which causes his autism (FOXP1 Syndrome) and recently we’ve noticed his skin looks yellow, but not the whites of his eyes. His grandmother suggested I call his great uncle who is a dermatologist to see if he had any suggestions to the cause. 

Let me preface this by saying that his great uncle is very big into a vegan holistic lifestyle. So much so that when his wife got cancer they thought they could eat all raw, healthy foods and pray it away. She ended up dying. I should have guessed what his response to me would be. 

He basically told me that there are many studies saying that if you eat a super healthy diet, it’ll change your gut biome and will eventually switch off any bad genes and that this is called epigenetics. He said that Angelina Jolie didn’t need her preventative double mastectomy. That if she had just changed her lifestyle she’d never have to worry. 

Now I am no doctor, but I know this is bullshit. If this was the case, people 200 years ago who never ate super processed foods and got lots of exercise would have never gotten cancer. I am just looking for an actual geneticist’s point of view. Does this theory hold any weight at all? That if I just change my son’s lifestyle and get rid of all sugars and processed food and cut out all meat and dairy that his duplicated gene will just switch off? I want concrete answers next time I speak with him, but I don’t want to offend him because he really is such a sweet human.",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/mqqmgc/autism_and_epigenetic/,genetics,-0.9971714615821838

"Closer to siblings, but not quite as far as cousins.","So I recently had to travel back ""home"" to the northeast from California to attend the funeral of my last remaining grandparent when in conversation with family I heard something uniquely interesting concerning my bloodline relationship to a cousin.

The conversation implied that I have a cousin that is practically my sister in the sense if genetic makeup than what a traditional cousin would be.

Here's the break down of our genetic relationship. (Names have been changed to protect the parties involved)

I am the son of John and Mary
She is the daughter of Mark and Jane

John and Mark are full blood brothers (same parents)
Mary and Jane are full blood sisters (same parents)

In others words, two sets of siblings were dating at the same time and each couple had a child (my cousin and I)

Now... Someone that really understands this stuff can you explain our genetic relationship (for instance if we were to take a dna test would is show a stronger relationship than cousins, and could it be a strong enough connection to be considered siblings)",https://www.reddit.com/r/genetics/comments/hl33e0/closer_to_siblings_but_not_quite_as_far_as_cousins/,genetics,0.9814096689224243

Cushing's syndrome - a living nightmare,"In 2019 I was diagnosed with cyclic Cushings syndrome. I had a tumour on my left adrenal gland about the size of my fist. We found this accidentally during a trip to the ER for the third time in three months due to incredible stomach pain. That pain was an over production of stomach acid due to the tumour.
So after a few months, I went and saw my doctor and he was concerned about my weight as it was, I was nearly 300 lbs and mostly in my abdomen, so he looked at the CT of the tumour the ER found and said it can be cushings or phenochromacytoma. I didn't want either of these.. but after talking to him and reading up on both, cushings syndrome was definitely a good diagnosis. I looked like a cushie. I had the moo face, the stretch marks everywhere, excess hair, the hump, all the excess abdominal weight, pendulous abdomen, swelling; the list goes on.
Then as we talked, I had all the other symptoms too. The severe anxiety and depression, insomnia, salt cravings, irritability - oh, it wasn't hard to piss me off - bipolar like emotions, extremely high blood pressure and heart rate. My heart rate was over 190 - DOING NOTHING. Blood pressure was always over 170/120.. even got on medication for it and it hardly went down.
The weight was so much on me, I could get out of bed without pulling on something to help me. Me shoes didn't fit due to the swelling. It hurt to walk. It hurt so much to get out of bed. I was out of breath and my legs were tired before I even entered a store after leaving my car. My body was constantly in pain. What hurts the most is I spent most of my life feeling this way, thinking this is normal. I'm just overweight and it'll be fine when I lose weight. I tried. I went keto. I spent 10+ hours a week at the gym. I slept properly. But nothing helped. It is impossible to lose weight while having active Cushings. I gained 167 lbs, 90 of those in one year.  With this being cyclic, there was a period of time when I did lose 60 lbs in 4 months with diet and exercise, but it all came back once I was stuck in a constant state of stress. Work started the stress, then soon after my mom died at 44, and then my heart was broken by a boy a few months later. Then I moved to a new city where my staff hated me and I was continuously in a state of stress.
Now stress is bad for Cushings because cushings is the over production of cortisol. The stress hormone. So that's why I gained so much, soooo fast. It's why I lost my job. I was too sick for too long without knowing and it affected my job performance. :( I wish I had seen a doctor and knew more about this disease before that happened.  I was also bullied in a daily basis about my weight and body shape. Called the worst names ever. It hurts me so much to be bullied for something I can't control. 
So after my doctor decided to start testing, I was referred to an endocrinologist who had me do the testing after observing my physical symptoms. I did a 48 hour urine test to measure my daily cortisol output. I did another CT scan, and I also had AM/PM blood cortisol withdrawn. The AM cortisol has to be done between 8 and 10 am. Earlier the better.
For those with pituitary tumours for Cushing's disease, they also do an IPSS test with is invasive but it will help determine if it is a pituitary source.
Cushing's syndrome is also caused by too much cortisol from medications. Elvis had Cushing's syndrome from steroid meds. If it's caused by meds, the next steps would be to lower or stop all steroid medications.
My tests all showed high cortisol levels and matched my physical symptoms. I'm so glad my process to diagnosis was so smooth but I wish I had done this sooner. Oh well, better late than never.
After diagnosis, they prescribed me ketoconozole. An anti fungal drug that reduces cortisol production. Once that started, I was able to lose weight, sleep more, the swelling reduced, and many other things felt better. I used that drug until the day of my surgery 7 months after the first visit. Left Unilateral adrenalectomy. ULA. Whet was nice is they only ended up making three small incision instead of being a full in open surgery because I had lost 40 lbs while medicated. Recovery from surgery went smooth, but recovery from Cushing's is a NIGHTMARE. I regret my surgery some days cuz it's so overwhelming. The first few months were terrible. The cortisol withdrawl is absolutely brutal and I went into an adrenal crisis 3 weeks after surgery and almost died. Upon leaving the hospital, I upped the hydrocortisone I was to be taking as my cortisol replacement until my other glands start working. Due to having an overactive gland, the other stopped producing on their own.
The emotional roller coaster is worse than ALL the physical pain I've experienced. I've wanted to die on many occasions just from being lonely and sad. That's another thing, DO NOT DO THIS ALONE. My doctor told me I NEED social interaction after my surgery, then covid happened and I live alone.. even this past week, I've wanted to die. It's the depression from the cortisol swings. It isn't me.. just the recovery. My body aches a lot. I have developed muscle atrophy because I can't exercise. But I have lost a total of 110 lbs. I sleep better, my hair is growing back, no more swelling, my stomach doesn't hurt etc. The symptoms are disappearing. I am 9 months post op soon and I'm so happy to be where I am.
The difficult thing for most cushies is finding an endocrinologist that believes in Cushing's, or getting test results with high levels. If the results come back low, it's considered negative and after one test some endos don't pursue it.
I'm so lucky to have had amazing doctors.. 

Some other downsides I this disease. I was infertile due to Cushing's and won't be able to have children now. :( with the weight gain and stretch marks everywhere - belly, arms, legs, lady junk, back.. there's no elasticity in the skin, so with the 110 lbs gone, all the skin is still there. I have a huge ""apron"" and my belly looks like the Harry Potter sorting hat. My arms have the huge wings and I tell my bf I'll just fly away one day.
My body is completely destroyed and I feel horribly hideous. Self esteem is shot entirely. I'm still bullied for being fat and gross. :( and I can't get my body surgically fixed due to costs. It's considered cosmetic and health care won't cover it. 

The recovery is anywhere from 6 months to 5 years long. Sometimes people never recovery and are steroid dependent forever. Hoping I don't have to take them forever as I'd like to be ""normal"" again..  my boyfriend doesn't understand much about it either and it's also not making recovery easy.. :( 

Also one huge thing too, many MANY women get misdiagnosed with PCOS instead of Cushings.  If you're a woman with PCOS and are still having serious issues, ask your doctor about Cushings.  It's 100% worth looking into as Cushing's can be fatal. 

There's my story. Thanks for reading! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/raredisease/comments/jdgyo1/cushings_syndrome_a_living_nightmare/,raredisease,-0.9924198985099792
Beads of Courage/Warrior Beads for adults?,"Hello fellow chronic but iconic friends! 

Tldr; would any adults be interested in participating in something like warrior bears?

A few years ago, I saw a beads of Courage program that adults were eligible for, but I can no longer find it. 
Every organization I can find seem to have an age limit of 21. 

I was really hoping to sign up for one for myself as my chronic illnesses are gettkng progressively worse and scarier. I can't get out of bed many days, let one ever leave my house other to go the doctor/treatment.

Since I can't even perform most of my own ADLs, I don't really do much. Most days I just read and do random miscellaneous crafts. Which is fine, but I was hoping to find something to add a little bit more purpose to my life.

Sooooo, that being said, I was thinking about maybe starting an organization or something like pizza courage/warrior beads, or whatever, for exalts. Probably exclusively adults right now over 21.

Would any of you be interested in something like that?

11mm Rathke Cleft Cyst,"I’ve been diagnosed with an 11mm Rathke Cleft Cyst.  I’ve had the “standard” labs of Prolactin, Cortisol, ACTH, etc.  all came back “normal” but they were taken at a random time of day with no fasting.

Online resources at UCLA, Mayo, and Cleveland Clinic all name symptoms such as:
- Vision loss
- libido problems
- depression
- anxiety
- fatigue
- dizziness
- weight gain

I have all these symptoms but multiple doctors are saying the symptoms are not related to the cyst, and that they are caused from other things. 

So, I’ve seen a neuro ophthalmologist who said the cyst is no where near the optic nerve so wouldn’t be causing the vision issues or dizziness.

I’ve seen 2 neuro surgeons who both say to check again in a year but advise to just leave it there as the symptoms don’t seem to be related. 

Does anyone have any advice?  I used to be a happy human being but now I’m basically just a list of symptoms and I miss my old self.  Have you ever heard of this type of growth? Do you have an experience you can share? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/raredisease/comments/1d94lig/11mm_rathke_cleft_cyst/,raredisease,-0.9992173910140991
Cure for NKH?,"Glycine encephalopathy (GCE) or nonketotic hyperglycinemia is an inborn error of glycine metabolism, inherited in an autosomal recessive manner due to a defect in a GLDC gene in the glycine cleavage system. The body produces too much naturally. This defect leads to glycine accumulation in body tissues, including the brain, and causes various neurological symptoms such as encephalopathy, hypotonia, apnea, intractable seizures and possible death. Also, has a biallelic mutation in the GLDC gene. Mutations in the GLDC gene account for about 80 percent of all cases of nonketotic hyperglycinemia. This condition is characterized by abnormally high levels of glycine in the body (hyperglycinemia). Affected individuals have serious neurological problems. The excess glycine builds up in tissues and organs, particularly the brain. Affected individuals have serious neurological problems. 
She also has agenesis of the corpus callosum (aka missing part in the middle of her brain) is one of several disorders of the corpus callosum, the structure that connects the two hemispheres (left and right) of the brain.

Why don't people care?,"http://myybeautifulnightmare.wordpress.com/2014/08/06/am-i-invisible/
I was diagnosed with a rare disease called LCH at 3 years old. It is unreal the number of people who just don't give enough shit to help make a difference. This illness can effect anywhere in the body, affecting my brain, it has had catastrophic effects on my life since I turned 13, including my transition from walking independently to requiring a wheelchair to get from A to B at 18, my speech has deteriorated, my hand movements have deteriorated, but nobody cares. Why? Because it's rare; people don't care about conditions that have little likelihood to affect them. This condition has totally obliterated my ability to move. Once damaged, it's gone. While most of you worry about first world problems, or like that irrational video on Facebook, I'll continue to fight this evil disease, fighting to get awareness and hoping that one day, it'll have the mercy to stop its destruction

Discover a Supportive Community for Lymphangiectasia at r/lymphangiectasia,"Hello r/raredisease community,

I wanted to share a resource that might be of interest to those of you who are dealing with or interested in learning more about Intestinal Lymphangiectasia (IL) — a subreddit dedicated to this rare condition: \[r/lymphangiectasia\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/lymphangiectasia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lymphangiectasia/)).

Intestinal Lymphangiectasia is a rare digestive disorder characterized by the dilation of the lymph vessels supplying the lamina propria of the small intestine. It can cause complications like protein-losing enteropathy, leading to a variety of symptoms including edema, loss of appetite, and malnutrition.

The \[r/lymphangiectasia\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/lymphangiectasia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lymphangiectasia/)) community is a growing space where individuals affected by IL, their loved ones, and interested parties can come together to share experiences, advice, resources, and support. Whether you're newly diagnosed, a long-term fighter, or someone who cares for someone with IL, you'll find a welcoming group.

Here are some of the topics you can expect to find there:

\- Personal stories and coping strategies from those with IL

\- Discussions on the latest research and medical insights

\- Advice on managing daily life and nutrition

\- Support for navigating the emotional and physical challenges of IL

The subreddit also has a comprehensive set of rules to ensure that conversations are respectful, informative, and supportive. It's a great place to learn and share without the noise and clutter you might find in broader forums.

If you or someone you know could benefit from joining this focused community, please do not hesitate to become a part of it. They're making strides in awareness and support for IL, and your voice could be an incredibly valuable addition to their discussions.

Warm regards and hope to see some of you over at \[r/lymphangiectasia\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/lymphangiectasia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/lymphangiectasia/))!

Recruitment for Rare Disease Study Now Open!!,"**TLDR;** Volunteers with and without rare diseases needed for study on rare disease diagnosis!

Study Website: [http://www.raregenedb.com](http://www.raregenedb.com/)

\-------------------------------------------------------------------

**Details:**

Hey all! I could really use your help! I am a PhD candidate at the University of Missouri - Kansas City, and I am excited to say I am now able to recruit subjects for my dissertation study. The study is looking at various trends in the rare disease community; including social determinants of health (demographics, insurance status, access to healthcare, ect), patterns in symptom profiles/genetic screenings/medical records that may be indicative of certain larger disease umbrellas to aid in proper initial specialist referral, as well as analyzing the language the health care system uses to discuss rare disease patients.

The overall goal is to better define the extensive journey rare disease patients experience, and in doing so, finally pinpoint actionable hurdles standing in the way of this community. In order to do so, we also need plenty of non-rare disease participants to act as the comparison group!

If you would like to participate, you do not have to worry about traveling to a study location - everything will be conducted online. Participants are able to take the series of surveys, upload relevant files, and request any other study related materials, all through a secured server hosted by University of Missouri - Kansas City.

Even if you are not interested in participating, I ask that you share this study and our informational site ([http://www.raregenedb.com](http://www.raregenedb.com/)) with those who may be interested in helping us uncover these experiences faced by the many “rare” patients impacted by the diagnostic odyssey.",https://www.reddit.com/r/raredisease/comments/171f67s/recruitment_for_rare_disease_study_now_open/,raredisease,0.9472367167472839

Soliris - Alexion Lawsuit and Scandals,"Hi!

I am posting to share a class action lawsuit that has come to light for those who have been on or are currently on Soliris. Hoping to spread knowledge and bring together anyone who has been on the drug or is currently on it. 

Super quick summary on me: 

I was on Soliris for 2 years from 2013-2015 when diagnosed with aHUS in 2013 and that journey wasn’t easy. It’s still not easy, but more from a mental perspective now. I am hoping to share my experience to help others who have either been on this drug, have been diagnosed with aHUS or PNH, or even if this reaches  someone who has been diagnosed with a rare disease and can find community in reading this. My largest concern has obviously been finding peace in being diagnosed with such a rare disease with little closure, but my other concern is how the case mangers at Alexion pushed the drug on me/ made me fear for my life. They also had confidential information about me that I am somehow now just realizing was not legal practicing. 

Please spread the word, rally the troops, and/or feel free to message me in regards to this! 

Below is the most recent of MANY articles revolving lawsuits against Alexion and their orphan drug Soliris. I hope this helps anyone out there.

It is late by me so I will come back and edit this more as I continue to gather more intel.

Living with Kallmann Syndrome.,"I have been living with Kallmann Syndrome my entire life. I was first diagnosed when I was 16 years old and placed on hormone replacement for 6 months. After no results, I gave up and stopped taking my medication. That was my first mistake and my biggest regret.

For those who are not familiar with Kallmann Syndrome; it is a rare genetic disorder that is defined by a delay/absence of puberty along with an absent/impaired sense of smell. Kallmann Syndrome affects 1 in 30,000 men and 1 in 125,000 women. It also affects fertility. Which brings me here today.

At 16 years old, I was told that I had a 1% chance of getting pregnant. At that time I couldn't care less. A baby was the last thing I wanted at 16. Now that I'm 26, that's the only thing I want.

I was recently referred to a specialist to re-evaluate my condition. I was told once again that I only had a 1% chance to conceive. He told me the only way I will ever have kids is if i pay 5,000 + dollars a month for injections and ultrasounds. My heart broke. I don't have a 5,000 dollar disposable income. At the end of the appointment, he prescribed me birth control to jump-start menstruation. Surprisingly, it worked. I took it for 6 months then was instructed to stop and see if my period continued. It didn't. As much as I tried not to get my hopes up, I did. Only to be left disappointed.

Having a baby almost seems impossible at this point. I am stuck in the denial/anger phase. Accepting that I may never have a child means giving up on the one thing I want more than anything and I am not ready to do that.

I am now stuck waiting for yet another referral to see a specialist. I'm not sure what comes next but, all I can do is hope. 

I've decided to start this blog in hopes that someone will find it and share their stories with me. I will continue to blog as I go through treatment. I want to try to shed a little bit of light on this condition. If anyone is reading this, please feel free to share it. I would love to connect with others suffering with this condition.

Digital Health Literacy Research,"Hi everyone,

I'm a graduate student in the US working towards my master's thesis. I know that I'm kind of yelling into the void here, but I'm wondering if anyone in this community would be able to help me.

For my thesis, I'm looking to learn about how people with chronic medical (genetic, ideally) conditions use the internet to learn about their conditions during and after the transition to self management. 

I'm looking to connect with support communities who might be willing to share my study information and help me connect with people who could be interested in participating in my research by chatting with me for around half an hour or so.

Would anyone have any ideas of good places for me to reach out to, or communities that might be particularly amenable to talking to grad students?

My girlfriend has PVNS (or TGCT) and I have questions…,"Hello! Never posted in here before. In early June, my girlfriend and I were on a vacation when she noticed a large lump on her arm that we’ve both never before seen. It turns out that the lump is in fact PVNS (or TGCT). Of course I’ve had questions and she’s had many since. Of the many whys we’ve been asking over this time, I keep coming back to this one… I’m not here for politics or anything but we are genuinely curious if maybe this could be caused by a series of the events listed here: In mid-late April, she received her second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Simultaneously, she was also getting laser hair removal on her armpits, her last session was the first week of May… in the first week of June she sees the first lump which was on the same arm that she got the vaccine. Is there any science about this or anyone who can give us some clarity? Are we alone in thinking that the series of events leading up to noticing a lump is correlated? Just looking for clarity.

Any ideas what this could be?,"I had multiple strokes. The first one at the age of 17, and another 7 strokes within 6 months in 2015.
I had every kind of checkup while I was in hospital, atleast 10-15 MRT/CT, angiographys, bloodchecks and even a PET-CT to check for tumors.
They didn't find any other possible cause, so they checked me for genetic causes. Both genetic checks for Morbus Fabry and CADASIL were negative.
Since new bloodthinner seemed not to work (I had new strokes), I had to take lots of combinations. The only combination working at the moment is the combination of  Plavix, ASS and Marcumar, which I still take today.
I don't have anymore losses in terms of vision, mobility or anything, they disappeared almost completely.

Add septic optic dysplasia to that…plus, who knows. We are undiagnosed in a lot of medical issues too.

Home. I wish I would had looked into Dna testing for mutations sooner. I’m looking for a company that may be interested in providing us free testing for the sake of research. 

My kids are also following in my footsteps as far as health (both are high spectrum clinical geniuses as well). We have drs in all areas of medicine that haven’t been able to give us answers. My skins been peeling off and I have severe inflammation of my subcutaneous that has kept me in bed for months. My sfn dr doesn’t believe the subcutaneous or skin peeling has anything to do with sfn. He’s trying to get me approved for plasmaphresis (5 days inpatient) but it’s been 4+ months and he’s still trying to no avail since a lot of my blood results are normal. I guess hemo is reluctant to sign off on it, even though I have skin, fat and muscle biopsies as well as imaging to prove I’m not crazy. Moneys tight as work is hard to come by when your skin on your butt hurts to sit on it and your feet hurt to walk on. This much pin makes it hard to think in general, I lay like a zombie now.

"Seeking People with Severe Hem A in Boston, Philadelphia & Milwaukee","Hello all,

I am a strategist at an innovation consulting company whose goal is to design experiences that help improve people’s lives. Our current project seeking to **improve the experience for people with Hemophilia A**, anticipating the new therapies currently under development. Our goal is to learn from people we speak with in order to understand and improve the experience of managing Hemophilia. We don’t sell anything nor want to push any particular treatment.

**We're looking for people (17-60 years of age) interested in speaking with us who have severe Hemophilia A (<2% FVIII). We will be traveling to Boston, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee during the months of May, June, and July.**

If interested, reply to this post or message me privately. Interviews will take place in-home and participants will be **compensated** **in recognition of their time**.
